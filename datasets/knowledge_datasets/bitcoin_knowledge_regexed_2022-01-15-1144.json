{"title":"Shelling Out: The Origins of Money","url":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/shelling-out\/","body":"the situations where such cooperation in fact occurs in the animal world are highly constrained. the main constraint is that such cooperation is restricted to relationships where at least one of the participants is more or less forced to be in the proximity of the other. the most common case is when parasites, and hosts whose bodies they share, evolve into symbiotes. if the interests of the parasite and the host coincide, so that both working together would be more fit than either on their own, (i.e. the parasite is also providing some benefit to the host), then, if they can play a successful game of tit-for-tat, they will evolve into symbiosis  a state where their interests, and especially the exit mechanism of genes from one generation to the next, coincides. they become as a single organism. however, there is much more than cooperation going on here  there is also exploitation. they occur simultaneously. the situation is analogous to an institution humans would develop  tribute  which we will analyze below.","image":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/static\/img\/docs\/shelling-out\/Wampum.jpg"}

{"title":"Measuring Value","url":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/measuring-value\/","body":"the tax collector's incentives are aligned with the other branches of their government in a task that benefits all associated with the government, namely the collection of their revenue. no organization of any type collects more revenue with fewer expenditures than tax collection agencies. of course, they have the advantage of coercion, but they must overcome measurement problems that are often the same as other users of accounting systems, such as owners of large companies. it is not surprising, then, that tax collectors have sometimes pioneered value measurement techniques, and often have been the first to bring them into large scale use.","image":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/static\/img\/docs\/measuring-value\/taxnarrowhouse.jpg"}

{"title":"Measuring Value","url":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/measuring-value\/","body":"when we apply the laffer curve to examining the relative impact of tax rules on various industries, we conclude that the desire to optimize tax revenues causes tax collectors to want to accurately measure the income or wealth being taxed. measuring value is crucial to determining the taxpayer's incentives to avoid or evade the tax or opt out of the taxed activity. for their part, taxpayers can and do spoof these measurements in various ways. most tax shelter schemes, for example, are based on the taxpayer minimizing reported value while optimizing actual, private value. tax collection involves a measurement game with unaligned incentives, similar to but even more severe than measurement games between owner and employee, investor and management, store and shopper, and plaintiff-defendant (or judge-guilty party).","image":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/static\/img\/docs\/measuring-value\/taxnarrowhouse.jpg"}
{"title":"Measuring Value","url":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/measuring-value\/","body":"as with accounting rules, legal damage rules, or contractual terms, the choice of tax rules involves trading off complexity (or, more generally, the costs of measurement) for more accurate measures of value. and worst of all, as with the other rule-making problems, rule choices ultimately ground out on subjective measures of value. thus a vast number of cases are left where the tax code is unfair or can be avoided. since tax collectors are not mind readers, tax rules and judgments must substitute for actual subjective values its judgments of what the reasonable or average person's preferences would be in the situation. coxon provides the following example. imagine that we wanted to optimize the personal income tax rules to measure income as accurately as possible. we might start reasoning along these lines:","image":"https:\/\/nakamotoinstitute.org\/static\/img\/docs\/measuring-value\/taxnarrowhouse.jpg"}
