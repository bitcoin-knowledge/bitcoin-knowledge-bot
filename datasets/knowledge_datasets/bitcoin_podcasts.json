{"title": "Blockstream Talk #4 \u2014 Jesse Knutson: Financial Products on Bitcoin & The Future of Institutional Demand", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/blockstream-talk-4-jesse-knutson-financial-products-on-bitcoin-the-future-of-institutional-3aa15eb1eda2?source=user_profile---------0-------------------------------", "body": "Jesse Knutson: yeah. so Blockstream obviously has a fairly large mining business and the BMN is basically our effort to tokenize that business  which has been predominantly institutional-focused  and to offer our mining business, that product, to a broader range of investors, whether theyre family offices or individuals. at the moment the BMN is only open to non-US qualified investors, but were working on broadening that to US investors as well. its not as easy as it sounds and i understand theres a lot of demand in the US, but its a work in progress so i appreciate the patience of the people that are waiting on that. each note is backed by 2,000 terahash, plus or minus, and what investors get is the Bitcoin that that underlying hashrate produces over the course of of 36 months. and what youre referring to with Adam having to buy Bitcoin in the market is: thats to maintain fungibility. so if you think about it, were issuing these tranches over multiple time periods, so the first one was done in april, and those investors have mined almost two Bitcoin in the 120-plus days since then. so if we do a tranche next week we have to make sure  for fungibility  to make sure that the tranche coming up has the same amount of Bitcoin. so you have to go into the market, buy 1.9 Bitcoin, and tie that to the new BMNs that are being issued. and so thats important for fungibility and to make sure that its all apples to apples. and then when we get this thing trading on exchanges, that therell be better liquidity, rather than having BMN series 1 tranche A, B, C  all the way through.", "image": null}

Our conversation today is with one of the worlds leading experts on the Lightning Network, Dr. Christian Decker. Christian is also known as dr Bitcoin because his dissertation was the first distributed computing phd that focused explicitly on Bitcoin. His work on duplex micropayment channels actually predates the Lightning Network paper. but in a bizarre twist of fate, it ended up being caught in academic review and publication ended up falling after the publication of the Lightning Network paper. in developer circles, christian is seen as the inventor  or at least one of the inventors  of Lightning-like scaling solutions. so really theres no better person to talk to about the current state and the future of the Lightning Network. most investors have been looking at Bitcoin as a high-growth inflation hedge. but whats going on in El Salvador, and how Bitcoin is actually being used in emerging economies is really bringing the digital cash narrative back to the forefront. so in this conversation i was keen to get christians views not only on the state of the Lightning Network now, but what could go wrong. is the Lightning Network ready for prime-time? and integration not into just a platform or a wallet, but into an entire economy, as well as the role of the Lightning network in driving Bitcoin adoption going forward. dont forget to like, subscribe, and share. and if youve got any ideas for future episodes let us know in the comments section below. Thanks again and i hope you find this conversation useful.", "image": null}

Basically we are limited by the parameters not just of the Bitcoin blockchain but also of the network that we run on to a limited capacity that we can use. and going beyond that, which might be required for a global system such as Bitcoin for everyday purchases, might not be possible directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. so what we do is we try to make more efficient use of the limited capacity that we have by aggregating more and more transactions into very few on-chain transactions. and the way we do this is by creating off-chain contracts that can handle hundreds or thousands of transfers and whose on-chain footprint then end up being just single transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. so what we do is we open a persistent relationship between two endpoints called a channel. we do that by sending a certain amount of Bitcoin to a multi-sig address where both endpoints have to agree on what happens with these funds, otherwise these funds cannot be moved. and then we decide on how to divvy up these funds. what we can do is, if you and i want to open a channel, i can put in 10 Bitcoin and you can put in zero  so initially all of the 10 Bitcoins belong to me, but then i can decide to basically pay you a Bitcoin by agreeing on a new settlement of this off-chain contract where you get 1Bitcoin and I get 9. so we change how the Bitcoins are tallied up. and once we are happy with how we did that or I want to use my funds elsewhere, we take one of these agreements  the latest one  and settle it on the blockchain, freeing these coins again from this off-chain contract, and at the same time settling every single agreement that we have in the meantime with just a single transaction chain. so for us its a way to aggregate many many thousands of transactions in a very small space. and besides that we have different trade-offs that we that we can also address later maybe.", "image": null}

The fundamental innovation that we had as compared to prior constructions like the simple micropayment channels was that we can move funds in both directions. With simple micropayment channels we were limited to forwarding only in one direction, because the way we were sort of disambiguating which state was to be settled was by the recipient choosing always the one where he had the maximum. With Lightning and later developments like Eltoo, we came up with mechanisms where we can actually enforce a later state without having to rely on these weak incentives to do so. As for limitations, yes we initially had a limitation about the number of Bitcoins you could put into a single channel, but that was much more to prevent people from pulling their life savings into a channel, and much less of a technical limitation. It is something that we added as a gentlemans agreement between parties to protect people that might be over-enthusiastic from getting really badly hurt. but you could always override that and we have since removed those limitations from the defaults.", "image": null}

And Lightning and other proposals certainly go into that direction where we anchor some predefined agreement on the blockchain itself and then we go into a separate room and do our trading back and forth and only when we want to settle, we go back to the blockchain and enforce what the agreement was that we settled. There is the Lightning Network as we have it today, there is a proposal such as Eltoo for different kinds of constructions for similar channels, there are discreet log contracts that try to do some more fancy stuff, theres multi-party channels, but all of these are based around the idea of setting aside some funds on-chain, immobilizing them such that the parties of the off-chain contract have to agree, and then mobilizing them again once this agreement has to be resolved. and that goes hand-in-hand with other attempts to increase the efficiency of the on-chain mechanisms: things like Taproot, things like cross-signature aggregation, where we make more efficient use of the capacities in the Bitcoin blockchain that we have to squeeze in ever more transactions into the existing space  this, without breaking backwards compatibility with existing client implementations.", "image": null}

I mean I too want to have Bitcoin be a currency that we can use in a day-to-day scenario, and that has always been my view of this system that and why its interesting to me ever since 2009. and so Lightning actually gives us the opportunity of having better trade-offs  or different trade-offs, lets say  to Bitcoin-on-chain transactions. besides the scalability multiplier that we already mentioned before, it also has different behavior. unlike on-chain transactions in Bitcoin, a payment on Lightning is final as soon as it is acknowledged by the recipient. so there is no waiting for confirmations  you can literally transfer Bitcoin over Lightning at the speed of light, and there is immediate finality. there is also a difference in privacy: when you use Lightning to transfer your Bitcoin back and forth, there is no permanent trace being left on the blockchain. what is left on the blockchain is an aggregate of millions of individual transfers, but not the individual transfer anymore. so, while buying coffee on the Bitcoin blockchain will leave a permanent indelible trace of my interaction with that coffee shop, in Lightning it is far far more difficult to disentangle the traces that are left on the blockchain by individual payments because theyre all bunched up into the final settlement, and it might even be impossible. so only people that are directly involved in the payment itself have any idea that there is a payment that happened. and so we have scalability, we have real-time payments, and we have privacy. and for us developers, maybe its interesting to see that doing off-chain contracts is also a way to add experimental features in a far quicker way than if we had to convince the entirety of the Bitcoin network to do an update because, Hey we have this cool idea, it might be worth trying it out, but now I have to go on a huge campaign to basically change the protocol. whereas if we go for off-chain protocols, we can have much quicker interactions, and only the parties that are involved have to even know about this experiment. and so over the last couple of years, theres a lot of experiments that sprung up from Lightning, to multi-party channels, to discrete log contracts, that would have been very difficult if we had to do that directly on the blockchain itself. because again, pushing changes down to the blockchain  a global consensus system  is really hard.", "image": null}

I think in 2017 a lot of us assumed it was going to be through micropayments and social media, but the whole El Salvador experiment is really interesting to see it come up organically through people that actually are unbanked that really need this kind of technology. so where do you think the bulk of the growth is coming from maybe in the next five years?", "image": null}

Samson is really the gas pedal at Blockstream pushing the company to be at the tip of bitcoin product development. and given his time at BTCChina, which was previously one of the biggest exchanges and miners in the space hes got some great insights into whats going on in China too. But the bitcoin market moves really fast, and as Im sure you can probably tell this conversation was recorded a couple of weeks ago. since this conversation Blockstream has launched its own ASIC arm and released our latest lightning network service greenlight you can hear Samson hint at these developments in the conversation. bear with us will definitely improve our time to market in future episodes. and that said i think theres some really good insights in this conversation! dont forget to like, subscribe, and share, and if you have any ideas for topics for future episodes, let us know in the comments section below. thanks again and enjoy the conversation.", "image": null}

My name is Jesse Knutson, Im VP of Financial Products here at Blockstream. Of course for episode #1 we have to have Adam Back, our CEO and co-founder, so thanks a lot, Adam, for taking the time to do this. [Our conversation today is with Dr. Adam Back, the CEO and co-founder of Blockstream. Dr. Back is not only the inventor of Proof of Work, but I think hes one of the only people in the industry that can talk knowledgeably across the multiple disciplines that we now group together and call Bitcoin: trading, economics, game theory, mining, not to mention the technical nuts and bolts behind Bitcoin itself. For the conversation today, though, I really wanted to focus on both the history of Bitcoin  because I think that there is a lot of important context there  but also the future of Bitcoin: where Bitcoin is going, and what its biggest challenges are going forward. I hope you find this conversation useful.]", "image": null}

So, what I want to focus on today is kind of the Adam Back backstory. How you got into Bitcoin and the early days of Bitcoin, the history of it. Because I think for a lot of people like myself that maybe came in a little bit later, thats really interesting context and I think often theres a bit of color on the trends and challenges that are playing out today in Bitcoin, that maybe some of the people newer to this space arent as aware of. So jumping into it, you know Bitcoin is really interesting  I think one of the things thats interesting about it is that you see a lot of patterns and topics just constantly get recycled, and I dont know if thats because of the cyclical nature of the halving cycles or what, but Nic Carter has the FUD dice, Fidelity has the 6 Common Criticisms of Bitcointheres probably up to 1020 now  but one of the mainstays is that Bitcoin is old tech, right? And so you often hear people criticize it and say that theyve got something newer or better, and I think basically the base of that criticism is that the first iteration of something is not typically the best, and its not the one that usually ends up surviving and winning in the end. So people who often make that criticism probably dont know much about the evolutionary history of Bitcoin, and some of the Bitcoin-like digital currencies that came before it like eCash, b-money and that kind of stuff. So I was wondering if to start it off, maybe we could talk a little bit about the evolutionary history of Bitcoin?", "image": null}

In cryptography, you dont want to do new invented cryptography building blocks or get too creative like that because its fragile, and if youre not an expert in it, you will tend to end up making a mistake. And it would be doing superficially the right thing, but it would make mistakes, so being conservative and not too adventurous with the technology building blocks and understanding how to combine them is key. So then in terms of electronic cash, precursors, and building blocks, there was a lot of interest to have electronic cash on the Internet, and certainly in the early 90s there wasnt many of the things we have today like PayPal, which are superficially  anybody can sign up, typically  its much easier to access [nowadays]. At that time, you needed to be a merchant processor, and it was pretty difficult to get one of those  it would all be covered in KYC, and youd have to pay with a credit card or a debit card and not everybody has one of those globally. So it was a pretty balkanized, restricted, and cumbersome payment system that was available, and most people werent using it other than to buy things, or for bigger stores to sell things. So people were interested to have something more Internet-native for electronic cashand for that to have privacy like physical cash. And so actually the first  as far as I am aware  privacy-enabling piece of electronic cash technology was by David Chaum, which was his blind signature technology. So its actually quite an elegant and simple-looking piece of cryptography once you see it, but a lot of people think about it as the benchmark like, This is possible. So after that there were many academic papers incrementally improving on that. So I think you can scroll forward from that to early to mid-90'sChaum had formed a company called DigiCash. Theyd actually developed the technology as a central server modelas almost all of those electronic cash protocols were  so unfortunately you were relying on a server as a single point of failure that, if the server would go offline, or the company operating it would go out of business, all the electronic cash tokens would effectively disappear, because the double-spend device tracking which coins were spent was on the server. And so that in fact happened with DigiCash. They set up a demo server  I probably have some unspent coins on a backup somewhere but you cant prove that they were spent or not at this point. And so that caused  it focused peoples attention on the fact that the single point of failure was an issue and so the next electronic cash systems were more decentralized in nature  reactive to that, basically. So in 1997 I proposed Hashcash as a sort of micropayment system to get around the problem that its difficult for people to pay and its not very decentralized because there are merchant processors and things like that. And DigiCash in particular was sort of integrated with banks. That was the way that they saw that working, and so they relied on permission, effectively. So they had a demo server that issued some free tokens and people like the cypherpunk set about trying to sell things like t-shirts and stuff like that for these tokens to see if they could bootstrap a value  because they were supposed to be limited in number  but part-way through that experiment the company went under and the database went offline. So from there I proposed Hashcash. And the thing that enabled it to be more decentralized was that there was no central database, so it was more scalable, but it wasnt respendable or redeemable. So it was created in an electronic world  it was mined  so you didnt need an interface to buy coins. They had a cost to create, so it satisfied part of the equation. It didnt satisfy transferring value to the recipient, but it satisfied that it cost the sender something. So it became a kind of postage stamp for anti-spam, denial of service, and things like that. But immediately after I proposed it, it seemed to to cause many people to see an analogy with physical gold, like that this is digital gold, and to try from there to work out how to make it respendable. So all kinds of ideas were brainstormed. Lots of mailing list posts on the cryptography and cyberpunks lists brainstorming about how to do this  over a period of years, actually. Some of them anonymous, because the cypherpunks were interested in privacy and remailers and things like that. And actually the the Hashcash system was partly reactive to spam in the remailer network. I was running a remailer at that time and people would spam through it, so it was a way to preserve privacy while combating spam as well. So in any case then the the two major protocols around that time  so its like a year later, 1998  Hashcash was in 1997, were by Wei Dai with b-money and Nick Szabo with Bit Gold and they were both using this kind of mine the coins using hashcash but then work out an outline of how that could form a decentralized, respendable, electronic cash system. So they both had the concept of a broadcast ledger that was verified by many nodes but they were not quite implementable. There were details to work out and there was a bit of human invention involved like supernodes or a group of supernodes like a federation that would have to decide periodically what the difficulty should be. Or in Bit Golds case it was just assuming that people would create coins as they wished, and if a lot of coins were created in a period  well I think he was calling those stamps  so people would create a lot of stamps in a period so that you could create as many or as few as you wanted. And if there was an interval where a lot were created they would be considered not very scarce, and then youd have a specialized market to assemble rare and common stamps into a standardized-value coin. so apparently this happens in stamp collections: there are market makers that assemble standard values. so he had that kind of thinking, but there was a lot of human involvement there. so in terms of what held that back? i think it was the human involvement in that and of course it didnt get implemented for related reasons. so the next bit of deployed technology actually was RPoW (reusable proof of work) by Hal Finney and that one actually didnt directly solve that difficulty problem  it still had the same problem. but it was a kind of combination of Chaums server, so it had financial privacy, whereas Wei Dais b-money and Nick Szabos bit gold i think had similar privacy trade-offs to Bitcoin, in outline. so Hal Finneys had much stronger privacy but it was centralized, and he used this  at the time  new type of hardware which is so-called trustworthy computing hardware.", "image": null}

and so you get the Sybil attack: i.e. that one person could pretend to be a million people and gain some advantage. so it it seems to me that  im sort of guessing at their thought process  but if you connect the thought process that led Satoshi to using proof of work both for mining/creating coins and to processing transactions in the network, could be that if you look at it (so that there are some other systems that use hashcash for creating pseudonyms, so you have the same problem with domain names and handles in chat systems things like that, which is: people will come along and take all the names if theyre free and so you want to put a cost and so there were some systems that didnt use credit cards but used hashcash proof of work to reserve names just to make it expensive to take all the names) yeah so it seemed to me that you could bridge the distributed system that is Bitcoin (now this is sort of like looking at it in hindsight how that thought process might have occurred  nobody knows why or how but this seems logical right?) so if you look at it, the byzantine generals problem has identities and youve got a system without identities, and if you look around there are people using hashcash proof of work to have a cost to create identities. so if you assemble the two things together, you make each node do some work to get an identity and then it can participate in a normal byzantine generals problem for like one block, and you can do it again. and if youd arrived at that combination you might realize, Well maybe you dont even need identities! you can just sort of anonymously do work proportional. so anyway that is finally the way that bitcoin works  so this is some supposition [after the fact], i dont know if thats actually how that was arrived at. so i think bitcoin started from a different direction which is: it provided a working decentralized solution. but i think people sometimes have the intuition that the first version of a technology is a kind of prototype and has a lot of room to improve and thats generally a reasonable assumption i would say. but surprisingly it seems that theres something unusual about bitcoin! so in 2013 i spent about four months of my spare time trying to find any way to appreciably improve bitcoin across scalability, decentralization, privacy, fungibility, making it easier for people to mine on smaller devices, get more of those coins  like a bunch of metrics that i consider to be metrics of improvement. and so i looked at lots of different [options]: changing parameters, changing design, changing the network, changing cryptography, and i came up with lots of different ideas, some of which have been formally proposed by other people since. but basically to my surprise it seemed that almost anything you did that arguably improved it in one way made it worse in multiple other ways. so it made it more complicated, used more bandwidth, made some other aspect of the system just objectively worse. and so i came to think about it that: bitcoin exists in a narrow pocket of design space  i mean the the design space of all possible designs is an enormous search space right?  and counter-intuitively, it seems like you cant really significantly improve it. and bear in mind, i come from a background of like, just out of phd in distributed systems, and i spent most of my career working on some large-scale internet systems for startups and big companies and security protocols and things, so i feel like i have a reasonable chance  if anybody does  of incrementally improving something of this nature. and basically i gave it a shot and concluded, Wow  theres literally, basically nothing. everything you do makes it worse, which was not what i was expecting! i was like, Great! lets improve the privacy, improve the fungibility, make it easier to mine on small devices, make it so that you can participate in mining in a very minimal way without needing to use a pool, and like basically nothing appears to be possible. and so thats not what people expect, but they havent gone through this process. they dont have this realization. so when people say that all these altcoins, they dont have any innovation  i mean thats actually a grounded statement  like its actually true. in the sense that: they wanted to do an effect, so they cut some corners, made some trade-offs, and they did it anyway, and each of them is typically objectively worse, typically much worse, because of all the network metrics and so on, right? so theyre de facto less decentralized, or make the system much more complicated. i think a lot of people dont realize that complexity is bad for security and dependability. so anyway thats a kind of counter-intuitive situation. so its certainly not that anybody in the bitcoin technology space is anti-innovation or that bitcoin is old technology. i mean i think for example people have the wrong intuition that bitcoin just ran [as is] from the beginning. in fact the software has changed remarkably: like being refactored, rewritten, optimized, the network protocols optimized. i mean the initial sync time  when you start a new node and sync  has been completely redone like four times and is 10,000x faster than it was at the beginning. so you can still sync an old node but peoples intuition that, Oh the code base is not changing  its just wrong. you can look at the code base and see that its one of the most active open source projects in existence by code changes and contributor metrics and things like that. and its certainly the case for the robust R&D as well  that a lot of R&D comes out of the bitcoin and the associated space. so i think sometimes bitcoin suffers from like not having a marketing department. there is no bitcoin: the company, theres no funded bitcoin communications or coordinated marketing. and so anything that is discussed is discussed in the open so people get to see it, see the trade-off discussions. so [bitcoin] doesnt really stand up for itself, right? and so its a little disappointing when people claim that bitcoiners are toxic or that bitcoin is stagnant because the facts are actually inverted: its just that theres no marketing department out there explaining these kind of computer science backgrounds and technical reality things.", "image": null}

Wow! thats something. so because i was familiar with the previous electronic cash systems, bitcoin makes some quite different trade-offs. so, in particular the security model takes a bit of getting used to, because in the other systems you have a very high security model where its kind of like breaking digital signatures or something  you need an enormous amount of compute, so its unrealistic to attack it. but the trust model assumptions in those systems are that theres a trusted central server. so the academics that came and looked at bitcoin took a while to be convinced that this was a plausible design, because the security model was basically that the good guys have more hashrate than the bad guys. so like 50/50, or at least equal cost in attacking the system is defending the system. and usually with public key cryptography  which is the norm with other electronic cash systems  the defender has an enormous advantage, just like an unimaginable advantage. so its almost impossible to do anything to it on the attack front, except for the fact that theyre a central server, so the central server is like a point of failure or in many cases has to be trusted as well, so its a trust problem.", "image": null}

Most people these days would know me in and around the Bitcoin space, but prior to Bitcoinand for most of my life  I was more entrepreneurial in terms of background. So ever since I went to uni  I was really academically strong back at school, and my core subjects of strength were physics, math, chemistry, and all of that. So I ended up doing engineering, but I dropped out of uni because I wanted to make my millions by the time that I was 20 and I put my scholarship money on the stock market  thought I was a genius in 2007  and I got absolutely raped. And yeah I was right in the thick of the whole GFC [Global Financial Crisis] stuff and that put my life in a completely different track. I dropped out of uni, I had to start some businesses to dig myself out of the hole. And my hole I was in was quite deep  I was about $250,000 in debt by the time I started in my 20s. And since then my life has been this entrepreneurial journey of starting different businesses, blowing some up, learning what not to do alongside what to do. I was an early gold/silver bug in the 20112012 period between what I saw during the GFC and learning about the first rounds of major QE [Quantitative Easing] at the time. It put me down that rabbit hole. Unfortunately, when Bitcoin came across my radar I dismissed it as, Whatever, Internet funny money  Ill stick with my gold and silver  my hard money, to my everlasting dismay, shame, and regret. But hey, after that I built a couple different businessessome successful, some fucking complete disasters. And it was in 2016 where I got Steve Jobsed out of my tech company that I built  the board pushed me out. And it was a mixture of arrogance on my part and stupidity on their part and everything, so they ended up taking over the company and sending it down the toilet because they spent all the money too quickly. But I was probably also a little bit of an immature tech entrepreneur at that stage, so we had our differences. But at the time that was a really painful experience for me, but what was interesting was that it was a catalyst for me to rediscover Bitcoin. And from there, as I looked at Bitcoin I was like, Holy shit, this thing is still around? What the hell is going on here? I started digging, and the more I dug, the more I found something that aligned with me, not only philosophically, but morally, idealistically  it aligned with so many of my core values around non-intervention, around voluntaryism, around individual responsibility, individual sovereignty, around the idea of getting the government and all of this shit out of the fucking way. So all of this stuff really, over time, aligned with me, and I very quickly became a Bitcoin maximalist, not through peer-pressure  like, I found my way there, then I found Bitcoin Twitter. And there was a couple articles which sort of put me on the map. I think the two were: (1) I wrote this one called Homo Sapiens, Evolution, Money & Bitcoin, and I made the argument that Bitcoin is an invention started 70,000 years ago. And I took people through an anthropological journey of how human society evolved, and how money was the tool that actually enabled human society to increase in complexity. There was that one (2) and also I wrote Bitcoin (BTC) / Bitcoin Cash (BCH). It was like the definitive guide. For those that know Murad Mahmudovs work  the Lindy Effect chart and Bitcoins evolution as a store of value, medium of exchange, and all of that  so he based that off that article where I created this pyramid of importance with respect to how Bitcoin will evolve in line with how natural systems evolve. That was where I first landed on the map, and alongside that time I had the early ideas for Amber, and here we are a couple years later.", "image": null}

We were the first DCA product in the world. Theres a series of others these days, whether its Swan or River and theres a couple others in Europe. So we were the first ones to build a product that enabled users to effectively accumulate Bitcoin. That was the whole point, is: I wanted to help people buy Bitcoin in a simple and easy fashion. And having learnt through errors over the years  when I think about all the time and energy I wasted trading derivatives and every single financial product you can think of, if all I did was just put ten bucks a week aside into Amazon, Id be a millionaire. But no  I thought I was a genius, I thought I would outsmart the market, I thought all this fucking bullshit. And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, of all the trading Ive done over the last 10, 12, 13 years, I might be  if Im lucky  even. Whereas, all I had to do was put ten bucks a week aside. So I wanted to build a product that did that particularly for Bitcoin because I think that the most important thing any individual can do for their future selves and for their kin is to collect Bitcoin. And thats effectively what the app does. We started it  like I raised capital in 2018, we went right through the bear market and all that sort of shit. It was really difficult. And with all these experiences that I had in the past  one of these guys in the chat mentioned Shark Tank in Australia  and yeah, I was on Shark Tank in a prior business. And it was an interesting experience for me, because at that time I was this young entrepreneur, I learnt the difference between raising capital versus the entertainment value in a show. Like all the stuff that I had said prior to going into the Shark Tank and out of the Shark Tank was actually prerecorded: so they actually coached me on what to day so I looked like an even bigger fucking fool, and  obviously, as the media does very well  I was in there for an hour and twenty minutes and I think they only cut down to 15 minutes and they showed like the most embarrassing parts. So I learnt through the school of hard knocks with all of that stuff. But throughout my life Ive picked up experience from all of these areas and I think that really helped me carry Amber through the bear market, in particular, because I was raising capital for equity in a real business whilst idiots were raising millions of dollars for fraudulent token sales for fucking toasters on a blockchain, or whatever other ridiculous dumbass ICO there was. And it was hard for us to raise capitaland we raised a fraction of what these ICOs raised by selling our company, whereas these guys didnt sell anything except the fucking promise of a pipe dream on a white paper. And they raised millions  they are all bankrupt today. We are still here with a product, delivering on what we originally promised. And I think we kind of credit that to all of the trials and tribulations that Ive been through in the prior chapters of my life. So to answer your original question, where we are now is: were fully functional in Australiawe are the easiest way to buy Bitcoin in Australia. Next step for us is to enter the US market, then well look at entering the UK, Europe, and sort of expand our presence out into the world. And the mission is still the same from day dot, which is: to enable the mechanism for people to accumulate Bitcoin in the easiest way possible. And thats it.", "image": null}

I think some people may adopt it a little bit quicker than others like personally, but I feel like  just going through my journey  its a couple steps. And Id love to get your thoughts on this. But maybe the first would be speculation, where I see a lot of people looking at Bitcoin as this vehicle to get more fiat. Like, Hey Im gonna buy Bitcoin [as a speculative] asset, then Im gonna wait until it doubles and then just take my fiat out and now I have two times as much fiat. So I feel like thats (1) speculation. (2) maybe is like the hedge, or part of a portfolio allocation. And then the third step is (3) your unit of account. And when I tell people thats how I see Bitcoin, I get a lot of weird looks, like, What are you even talking about? Unit of account? Like, when you go through these progressions and you get to the third step, you really stop seeing dollars, you stop seeing fiat, and all you see is sats. And I know some people are like, Whoa! Im not level three  Im just learning, and all that. But what do you think about that progression? Because  I dont know about you  but thats how Ive looked at it.", "image": null}
{"title": "The Level Up Experience Podcast | Aleks Svetski | Bitcoin is the Escape Route", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-level-up-experience-podcast-aleks-svetski-bitcoin-is-the-escape-route-24a4993e4015?source=user_profile---------4-------------------------------", "body": "Aleks Svetski [11:21]: I think thats true. Theres two things Ill mention here: (1) I said to one of the Telegram groups, My net worth went up today because I measure my net worth in Bitcoin. So I actually bought more Bitcoin today. And people are like, My net worth went down today. No no no  because Ive actually got more Bitcoin today than I did yesterday, and thats exactly what Im measuring. And for me, my net worth has just been consistently going up, because Im consistently collecting Bitcoin. So I think when you finally get to stage three, the price of Bitcoin doesnt even mean shit anymore except that whenever you come across some fiat youre able to convert that fiat into more Bitcoin if the price is lower, which is always a good thing. I actually enjoy it when the price of Bitcoin is lower because I can exchange more of the shit fiat that I have with someone on the other side whos willing to give me their Bitcoin for this worthless fake government money. So Im always thankful for that. But to your point about the progression  I think that is quite true. So Ive got a saying that most people know from my Tweets and podcasts and stuff, which is: I came for the money, and I stayed for the money. And what that means is basically what you described. Its: I came to speculate and make some money, but as I discovered what this is, I realized that, No  holy shit. The most important thing happening in the world today is the de-monopolization of money, is the ripping out of the hands of any institution, any government, any central bank, any individual, any organization whatsoever, ripping the capacity for any of them or any of usanyone, anywhere  to print money. That is the most important thing happening. So its the separation of money and state. And for me thats whats kept me here, and whats allowed me to dig deeper into Bitcoin. And out of all the topics that Im involved in, for those who know my podcasts and stuff  I go into some really crazy topics whether its religion and philosophy  I just did one with Jean-Franois Garipy who wrote The Revolutionary Phenotype, which is probably the most important work on biology since Dawkins Selfish Gene, maybe even since Darwins Natural Selection. So its like I go into all sorts of stuff, but for me the one all-encompassing topic is Bitcoin. It just keeps sucking me in, because it touches on all of these areas that Im interested in and that aligns so strongly with the core values that I have as a human being and as a sovereign individual. So yeah I think that conversion is important, and I think the journey from coming in and looking at it as a speculative way to make money and then staying in it as, This is the money that Ive now adopted and that Im measuring my productive capacity in, really depends on what seeds have been planted along the way. So I was lucky enough to have lost everything in the global markets in 20072008. I started developing a really healthy distaste for government, for intervention, for QE, and all that sort of stuff at an early age  in my really early 20s. I started off as an entrepreneur so I became extremely responsible, like Id never had a paycheck literally until recentlyover the last year and a half or two years where Amber started making money Id actually started drawing a salary  Id never had a salary in my entire life, ever. Ever, ever, ever, ever. I never knew what a salary felt like, because if I made money  you know, in some businesses I made money, in some businesses I fucking lost everything  so theres been periods where I was eating cans of tuna and fucking one can of tuna a day for a whole week, theres been periods where Ive been doing very well. So Ive always had this sort of tumultuous existence because Ive always chosen a path of responsibility. And for me that was a real primer as well about Bitcoin, because I call Bitcoin the Renaissance of Responsibility. We live in a world of complete dependencydependency on the state, dependency on supply chains, dependency on all sorts of shit  and that creates a very fragile world, and a very fragile existence. Where if something cracks or if something pops, everything else starts to break down. Whereas living a life of responsibility actually gives you true freedom, true choice, true capacity to be sovereign, true capacity to make decisions. And yeah, those early seeds for me I think helped me really adopt and embody the idea of Bitcoin quicker than maybe most. But even irrespective of that, I still had to go through the journey. So thinking of it as a journey is spot-on.", "image": null}

Pretty similar to what you were mentioning, my story is: my step-dad made me open up a ROTH IRA retirement account when I was 18 and then just a few years later, half of its gone, down 50% because of the GFC, right? But thats when you learn your lessons. Because it forced me to ask, Why is this happening? What is going on? as you were mentioning. I was trying to find some meaning. The unfortunate side of it is I heard about Bitcoin in like 20122013, but I feel like the very first time you hear about it  and a lot of people say this  people ignore it, typically. Like the very first time. Unless maybe [you were] a cryptographer or you really understood the technology inside and out initially. So for me my cousin told me about it in 20122013 and Im like, I dont know about that. Then 2016, being around the financial markets Ive always been fascinated with charting and things like that, and you see an asset thats hit the high of like $1,200 and then it consolidated for three years and all of a sudden its re-testing those $1,200 highs from 2013 in 2017. You know, the ETF talk and all that, so it was very interesting just from a charting perspective, like, Wow! This asset consolidated for three years and now its re-testing those highs. That was just interesting. So thats when I started following it more price action-wise  but then still ignoring it! And then I didnt even have any amount in it that was significant until China banned exchanges, and then it crashed from like $4,800 to $3,500 that night. Ill never forget that night. Im like, Well its down 30%, I guess theres no those corrections! It was like the fourth correction during that cycle. But even then in 2017 as I mentioned earlier it was more speculation. It wasnt until 20182019, like when you really dig deep, thats what really pulled me down the progression even more to see it as not just a hedge, but a portfolio allocation. And then I feel like the kicker  I read the Bitcoin Standard  and then theres just so much great content thats been put out over the last 23 years especially. But obviously 2020 happened and then we had the capitulation. And I think 2020 in March  Id love to hear your take too  but the lowest buy I got in March of 2020 was at $4,500. Ill never forget that night. Ill never forget it. Because it was like one of those moments likeyoure on the edge: if you didnt quite believe in Bitcoin you probably got out because you panicked. Or you were fine because you knew what asset you had. So I didnt bottom-tick at all  I didnt get to $3,900  I wish. But it was that conviction, and anything that youre putting value into, your convictions gonna get tested.", "image": null}

So two things in there: I think you mentioned, If youre a cryptographer or an engineer you understand the technology and are likely to get it. I actually would push back on that. I think that those people are the least likely to get it and that those people are most likely to become shitcoiners and create their own chain and end up doing that. I think to really appreciate Bitcoin  and me and Giacomo Zucco talked about this on Episode 25 of the Wake Up Podcast  but we discussed it on there and he put together a model, like a Venn Diagram, which is: you need to understand technology well enough, you need to understand ethics, morality, Libertarianism and that stuff well enough, and then you need to understand economics and monetary history well enough. And somewhere where those three disciplines overlap, theres a Venn Diagram and its in the middle where youre a Bitcoiner. And when any two of those overlap youre either a goldbug, a shitcoiner, something else  whatever. But I think that the Bitcoiner in the Venn Diagram is really rare and it requires quite a broad, general understanding of a series of topics, and thats why I think that the greatest thinkers in this space  the people like your Breedloves and your Saifedeans and your Michael Goldsteins and your Pierre Rochards and all of that its because theyre broadly capable enough to cross a bunch of different disciplines, and they found the essence of all of those. And thats what Bitcoin seems to reward  not the techies, not just the pure monetary guys  because theres so many Austrian economists and Libertarians. Like for the life of me, I dont understand how the fuck they dont get Bitcoin. Like I call them the battered women of politics. Because  Libertarians, especially  it always cracks me up: theyre always talking about how dumb the state is, like the state needs to get out of the way, and all this sort of stuff, but they dont do anything about it! Like heres Bitcoin as a tool to enable the dream that Libertarians have always had  but they dont fucking adopt it! Like, its insane! So thats one thing I just wanted to put forward there. Your other question about the conviction in March  so I actually remember March quite distinctly. I was in Berlin, I had been kicked out of my Airbnb because some cranky fucking old bag of a neighbor got annoyed because apparently my speaker was too loud and the Airbnb host kicked me out of the apartment the night before, so I had to check out that day. And as Im checking out  Im sort of in this foreign country, I was supposed to fly out but my flight got cancelled because all the Corona bullshit happened  it was just this tumultuous thing. And that morning, like Bitcoins fucking crashing and Im sitting there outside in the foyer of this old-ass building trying to get WiFi at the door because the cleaners in there, hes like, Look, you cant stay in here, you gotta get out. And Im sitting there trying to like buy fucking Bitcoin. And at the same timelike, one of the things I do is I never sell my Bitcoin, so I always just draw a little bit of US Dollars against it through Unchained Capital. So at that time, my fucking loan went into margin so I almost got liquidated  I almost lost a bunch of my Bitcoin through Unchained. So Im sitting there like trying to buy more Bitcoin and at the same time move Bitcoin from my Ledger and my Trezor to get it over to Unchained to like consolidate the loan and all this sort of shit, but I dont have Internet access and the staffs telling me to get out of the fucking apartment. And like it was just this chaos, absolute chaos of a dayand dude, I got within sixty seconds of losing half of my Bitcoin and being liquidated that day, because I had to go drive to the shopping center somewhere to get Internet access to move every last bit of Bitcoin I had from my Ledgers, from my Trezors, from my different exchanges that I had just bought, getting money shuffled and all this sort of stuff. And I just fucking made it. And luckily on that day, I ended up with more Bitcoin than I had, but I came that close to basically losing most of my stack. Just because like it was just an awkward day! If it had happened one day earlier, I would have been at home with WiFi and I wouldve been able to deal with all of that stuff. But it was just a classic  one of the Aleks Svetski stories of shit hitting the fan. But yeah I mean  that, for me  I was like a pig in shit in the sense that I couldnt believe people were just dumping this thing! I was like, What the fuck is wrong with everyone? I wish I had more cash, basically. I just wish I had more cash that day.", "image": null}

Like you just said, the way that things just lined up I was just not as liquid as I wanted to be. Like I got some $4,500 but obviously I wanted more and more. But I think a lot of people were just in a crunch. Just the way it ended up working out  and everyone personally is in a different situation. But yeah, for those that may not know, Bitcoin within two days went from $9,000 to $3,900 back in mid-March. I know in like Clubhouse rooms, people ask me, Well, [look at] what happened to Bitcoin in March. But really every asset in the world got crushed because it was a flock from assets into the Dollar. The Dollar was the only thing that spiked. And it was people getting margin called and everything else, and not having enough collateral to post and things like that. So then if you look at the DXY chart, the Dollar spiked and then really has been in a down-trend ever since March. But thats essentially what happened. It wasnt so much a fundamental thing that people were selling their QQQ or selling their SPY or selling their Bitcoin, it was literally like they had to sell for collateralization and things like that  it was just a cascade effect.", "image": null}

But if you look at it more like people look at a mindset of a 401k, kind of a set it and forget it like I had a conversation, somebody took me out to lunch earlier today and they were asking, How do you see Bitcoin? And initially Im like, Hey look, just see it as just a savings technology. Like I put a lot of my value  and I dont mind saying it75% of my net worth is. The other 25% is a lot of like my personal home that I havent been able to get equity out of, right? So Ive done it over the last especially two years, because its my value, and no one can do anything to it! And thats what I was telling him today, like, No one can inflate on it. No one can inflate my value away when I have it in cold storage. You cant do anything to meto my sats. Like, I dictate if my sats go up or down based on my decision, not nine people making a decision to inflate away my value. So ultimately thats like the crux as to why over the years I went from speculation to the unit of account. That really seeped into my brain last year.", "image": null}

Like, all of these things that weve sort of created over the last 3, 4, 5, 6, decades are basically mechanisms for people desperately trying to figure out a way to preserve wealth for the future, because savings dont exist anymore. You cant save! Like, the entire system is deranged, and it rewards two things: consumption and blind chase for yield in a desperate bid to preserve and somehow generate wealth quicker than what youre losing it as in cash. So its like, it is so fundamentally wasteful, it is stupid, it is a gross misallocation of assets. And it really dawned on me a couple of years ago sitting at a cafe with my mum: shes been working all her life and particularly over the last 5-6 years she saved up something like $50,000 or whatever it was, and shes sitting there saying, What do I do with my money? I dont know anything about the markets, your brother,like my brothers a trader and fucking  I call him a gambler. Hes an idiot. You know, hes saying oh, I should give him the money and he should trade it. The issue is: the last time I gave him the money he lost it all. And shes like, I dont want to leave it in the bank because Im not earning anything. And Im sitting there thinking like, Fucking hell. Imagine working your ass off for years  like your entire life  and not knowing what the fuck to do with your money because its just gonna like melt. It is criminal  and thats what pisses me off  its like: Bitcoin does away with all of the crap that weve sort of built around superannuation or 401ks or these fucking ETFs and blind chasing yield and all this crap. It does away with all of that. All of it, all of it, all of it, all of it  because its unnecessary. Its not needed for society to function. Whats needed for society to function, and whats the very foundation of civilization, is the capacity for an individual to perform work and to save. And then, in the future, use those savings for something that they want to acquire or to invest in. Simple as that. And we dont have the savings function in society today, and as a result, we are blind fucking consumers, we are investing in shit that doesnt matter, were creating bubbles across every single asset class, and were wondering why the the world is so fucked up at the moment. So I think Bitcoin does away with all that stupidity and I just find that extraordinarily powerful and extraordinarily interesting.", "image": null}

Simple as that. So like we perform work, we trade our two scarce resources  our time and our energy  for something that we can measure it in. So we need to measure the productive capacity of each human being. And we do that with this technology called money. And money is a meta-idea that has existed since the beginning of time, like Ive discussed it in the article that I wrote a couple years ago. So of course the more the tool or the object or the technology we use maps to the meta-idea of money, the more functional society is, and the more society can actually build real wealth. And this is somethinglike I always use the example of the Spaniards in the 1300s, the 1400s, the 1500s. So these guys  even on a gold standard  they conflated the idea of money with the idea of gold. And what they did is they actually hyperinflated themselves on a gold standard. They went and they dug up all the fucking gold from South America and whatever else they did, they brought it all back to Spain, they increased their supply of gold, and they crashed their own fucking economy because they conflated gold with money. It doesnt matter how much [you have] of the object you create as money  if youre not increasing the productive capacity of society, you dont have more wealth! Wealth is something that we create through work. And therein lies one of the things that modern economists, modern economics  all this sort of shit  just doesnt seem to understand. And it really is a 101 concept, is: you create wealth not by fucking printing it, but by doing some sort of work and adding some sort of valuable input into society. And Bitcoin is the apex money, the apex technology, that can map as closely as possible to money, because it is fixed, because its open in nature, because it is voluntary in nature. And like you said, good money pushes out bad  and for those who want to know its called Greshams Law  and I kind of call it more than just Greshams Law, I call it economic Darwinism. And I always use the example when Im on Clubhouse to chat, which is: if youre gonna work for a week at a cafe or whatever youre gonna do  youre gonna work at your job for a week  and at the end of the week, the employer turns around and says, Yep. Im gonna pay you in salt. Or in toilet paper, or in glasses or something. And youre like, Fuck off! Give me the money! I want the money! And the reason you want the money is: you demand the most salable good  the one that is the most capable of storing value in a stable manner, the one that is able to be exchanged easily, the one that you can measure other goods and services in and [tie to] the unit of account function. Nothing can compete with Bitcoins capacity to perform those three functions of money, because nothing scores a 10/10 across all of the attributes of money: divisibility, portability, recognizability, fungibility, scarcity, impossibility to forge. Nothing competes with Bitcoin on those attributes, and therefore in its ability to perform the functions of money. So what is going to happen over time  and its not a matter of if, its a complete matter of when  is who is going to decide to demand Bitcoin for their time, their energy, their services, and the products first. And I wrote an article about this mid-last year called Bitcoin and Lockdowns, where I put forward a model for understanding hyperbitcoinization and what the trend will look like, and its a necessity curve. So on one side youve got curiosity, and then on the other side youve got pain. And somewhere on the spectrum of curiosity to pain, people adopt Bitcoin. Now if youre more curious, youre gonna get into Bitcoin because you want to. If youre more ignorant, youre gonna get into Bitcoin because you have to, because some sort of painful situation emerges that pushes you into it. Either way, youre gonna get there. So the only choice is not, Are you gonna use Bitcoin,  because you will  whether you like it or not, youre gonna have to. The only choice is: when and on what terms are you gonna use Bitcoin? So yes, information asymmetry has something to do with it, but also so does where you are, the life youve grown up in, how much personal responsibility you take, what your personal ideologies are, how your value hierarchy is  and all that stuff really matters, because if it maps closely to Bitcoin then heyyoure gonna adopt Bitcoin before the other clown who believes in money printing and socialism or wealth distribution, all that sort of stuff. Theyre never gonna get fucking Bitcoin so theyll probably be the last to come onboard. So I know theres a lot there, I dont know if theres any threads you want to pull on, but yeah its gonna happen whether like it or not.", "image": null}

I just laugh  humans are very interesting about when people get interested in things. So I know thats a whole rabbit hole for you and I totally get that. But its funny how it is. So one of the things that comes up is, Well Cris, how is it a store of value when its so volatile? And I go down talking about price discovery and things like that, but no  Im actually trying to learn better how to explain to someone when they ask me that. So whats your explanation?", "image": null}

If you take a pizza and you start chopping it into parts, youre not creating more pizza. So if you have a slice of pizza and that is your proportion of the entire pizza  and theres no way to create another pizza  your proportion of the pizza always stays the same. And that is the definition of the store of value: its the inability to change the proportion that any person owns of the whole. That is actually the definition of store of value. Price has nothing to do with store of value. It never has, it never will. So store of value is about proportionality to the whole. And this is where I think people miss out on understanding why Bitcoin is a store of value! So when you have 1 Bitcoin, you always have 1/21,000,000th of the entire supply. That is fixed, unchangeable, incorruptible  whereas if you have the Dollar, you have no fucking clue how much of the total you have. So therein lies the store of value position for Bitcoin, is: it is a perfect store of value, because you know your proportion in relation to the whole. The price of Bitcoin has got nothing to do with Bitcoins store of value. Its only got something to do with peoples relative perception of how they individually and subjectively value Bitcoin. And that has nothing to do with store of value. Thats just like my perception on water versus maybe your perception on beer. Theyre two different things: you might like to drink beer, I might like to drink water. Thats perfectly normal. So thats how I would describe it.", "image": null}

Obviously its a process. Like people obviously want things  just like society  as a consumer mindset, they want it [snapping fingers] like that, they want the answer. Everyone has their own process into how they understand what Bitcoin is. Back to the volatility thingI think if people would change their framework and instead of looking at Bitcoin like BTC/USD where theyre seeing these hyperbolic moves over time to the upside over the last eleven years, if you look at it upside-down the Dollar is crashing. If you completely inverse it, because visuals are powerful, and if you flip it around and then you say, Wow, the Dollar is crashing against this asset. And everything is crashing against Bitcoin. So if people that are doing charts just flip the script on what youre looking at  and its interesting how minds can play tricks on you in how like even minds see risk when somethings going up. Like one of the hardest things to do is add to your winners because its a psychological FOMO to get out to lock in something. For example, angel investors tend to typically have clauses to add on to companies as their valuation gets bigger. Like theyre adding to their winners  VCs and whatnot downstream. So I think changing perspective  usdsat.com, you can see it priced in sats. And [the Dollar] is just absolutely crashing. So yeah the volatility is obviously a question that comes up a lot of times and like you said its perspective.", "image": null}

And if they go down the path of saying, Well maybe we should just set the value. Well then were back at fiat money. An organic money has to grow, and in order to get from nothing to something that requires growth. And show me one thing on the planet in the real world, in the fucking imaginary world, wherever, that grows in a straight line  nothing, zero  it doesnt happen. Whenever I think of the volatility question when people talk about volatility  first of all, Bitcoin itself is not volatile. Bitcoin is the most stable network on the planet. The only thing that is volatile is peoples subjective perception all around the world. And how many people are having deep conversations like this where theyre trying to understand money, where theyre trying to understand how society evolves  theres fucking barely anyone. So realistically, how many people really get Bitcoin? Its only a few. So that means most people are just out there fucking gambling. So as a result, of course there is gonna be fluctuations and subjective valuations, because all the market represents is a conglomeration of different peoples perception of what this thing it valued to them subjectively. And thats all the market is showing. And all were seeing in the rising relative price of Bitcoin is a growing proportion of individuals who understand that they will not swap their Bitcoin for any other inferior form of money. And as a result, there is less available for other people to buy or other people to gamble with, and its just the good old investing 101 or economics 101 supply/demand equation. And once youve been around for a while these things just start to seem so simple. Like fuck, its just funny watching people.", "image": null}

I did want to add to that. If youre talking to a portfolio manager or if someone is looking at it through a finance lens  look I get trolled by a lot of people on LinkedIn. These fiat-pushers man, theyre pretty good. Theres some interesting people. But when I bring up that Bitcoin has the highest Sharpe ratio  risk-adjusted returns  over any 5-year period, they have nothing to day. Because they have all these metrics they want to throw at you. But you say, Hey, risk-adjusted, any 5-year period  it has the highest risk-adjusted return, it has the highest Sharpe ratio compared to any other asset class in the world. Real-estate, gold  its the highest. So the risk that you are taking to get the gains from that asset  its the best ratio out there, right? But you dont hear that very much! It just fascinates me that you dont hear that. But for the risk youre taking, you have the [best] upside. When someone says like asymmetric upside or asymmetric return, thats what people are talking about.", "image": null}

I used that a lot back in the day. These days I guess for me where Im at on my journey  when you get to stage three progress that youre talking about  what youre describing there [with] risk-adjusted returns and all that stuff is basically the stage two. Its the hedge, right? Youre adding that to your portfolio. Its definitely on that path. I mean its a good argument for getting people to get some skin in the game, and I think thats a very valid point, but once you get some skin in the game you quickly start to realize  assuming you continue digging and trying to understand Bitcoin  you quickly realize that even that doesnt matter, the allocation. You start to measure your entire portfolio in Bitcoin. So when it sort of becomes the unit of account everything else sort of starts to become obsolete. One person I called out in 2019 and just watched everyone sort of kissed his asshole was Raoul Pal. I cant stand that idiot. I honestly cannot stand him  Ive never been able to stand him, long before he started talking about Bitcoin. Hes just one of those clowns who failed at Goldman Sachs, like you have to be really dumb to fail at Goldman Sachs. He then went on to run a service to tell people about the markets  and hes been wrong for fucking 10 years about how everything is gonna crash. He was wrong even in March after the crash, hes like, Ah yeah, this is never gonna come back  nothing is ever gonna go up again. He was wrong again. The guy is wrong about everything. And hes a perfect example of someone who just doesnt get Bitcoin. So he kind of came at it from that angle of allocating some of your portfolio to it and all that sort of stuff, but clearly because he doesnt understand Bitcoin, because he doesnt know how to think about Bitcoin as a money  despite having access to some of the best minds in the world about it  hes gone and assumed that its just another asset in the basket. So henceforth, maybe I should also put my money into Ethereum and oh Im warming up to Ripple, and how about fucking Dentacoin or Dogecoin or whatever other bullshit hes gonna think about. So I think thats a good entrypoint  allocating some of your holdings to Bitcoin  but if you sort of stay stuck there, you are 100% prone to end up adding pointless fucking garbage into your portfolio because you think theres some sort of gain to be made by diversifying in crypto. And I think each one has their dangers: speculation has a danger, the second part has a danger, but theres freedom and liberation in getting to the point where you understand Bitcoin as the unit of account, at which point all the other stuff starts to become irrelevant.", "image": null}

Its not even so much they want to, its that theyve been forced to. And the other number I wanted to bring up too is theres $20 trillion in negative yielding bonds, and my brain cant understand that. That thats an actual number. And right now Bitcoins market cap is like $900 billion, but theres $20 trillion in negative-yielding bonds. Where essentially  laymans explanation  I give the bank money, the bank gives me back less. It makes no sense to me!

Its propelled me to once again become like a lifelong learner. I think I had this epiphany the other week when I was preparing for the podcast with Jean-Franois Garipy the biologist. And I was like, Fuck me! I was sitting there studying his book and learning about the phenotypes and how DNA emerged from RNA and all this sort of stuff and Im like, Im doing this study of my own volition whereas back when I was a teenager I would have had to trot it at school to learn this shit. So I think much like the Renaissance 500600 years ago, there was this sort of inspired class of people who were driven to learn about the world cross-contextually across so many different disciplines. So for me I think one of the things that Bitcoin has inspired me to do is really become a broad lifelong learner. My level of curiosity across different subjects has gone through the roof. I think thats probably one big thing. Another big thing is its made me a lot more frugal and a lot more discerning when it comes to spending of any sort. Its made me realize the futility of trying in any capacity as a central institution or anything to govern human action and human behavior which is effectively economic action. So theres sort of three high-level things. And maybe a fourth thing is a realization that the current paradigm that were living in with respect to how human beings are governed and all of that, is what I like to call an overlord-subject relationship, whereas the mechanism that drives humanity forward is actually a customer-service provider relationship, because that is additive in terms of its effect. Whereas the overlord-subject relationship is reductive, because the overload is always sort of stealing. And I think things like democracy and all these sorts of ideas, all these politics of turn the world  civilization emerged through the capacity of individuals to trade amongst each other and add wealth and make it cumulative  all these institutions of governance that have emerged have basically been these parasites that have sucked value out of the value creation chain amongst human beings. And for me its just really unveiled the fallacy around any form of governance, any form of control by human beings where moral hazard and no skin in the game exists  which is basically all the kind of regimes were living under today, which are all self-funded by the capacity for a government or institution to print its own money and tax the populous. Alongside all those other things  like I said: being a learner, being more discerning about my spending, and just understanding the world in a more holistic, principled way. I think thats the impact Bitcoin has had on me.", "image": null}

Thats just how Ive seen it just in my personal journey the past 23 years. And then it frees you to not have to be on the rat race that everyone talks about. Everyone talks about the rat race and trying to keep up and debt and half of America cant afford a $500 emergency and things like that. But its because they are on a fiat standard  theres other reasons  but if you are under a fiat standard, if youre under an unsound money, its chasing after inflation. Inflation is not 4%, its 10%, probably. It might be 15% asset inflation.

When people ask me, How does Bitcoin fix the world in terms of poverty and people that dont get a change to get ahead and everything? Im like: look, the only way for a human being to move forward is to build wealth. And the only way to build wealth is to trade something of value for money and be able to save for the future. If you cant save, you cannot build wealth, and you can never ever ever get out of the rat race. And thats what Bitcoin fixes. Is: Bitcoin allows us to once again build wealth as individuals because we can save. Saving comes before investing. You cant invest without having some mechanism for saving. And by fixing that, Bitcoin actually gives people the chance  should they want it  to get out of the rat race. Without Bitcoin, you will never get out of the rat race. I mean some few of us might be able to add so much value  and thats fine, thats great. But by and large, most people just cant. They will be forever indebted and theyre forever running a rat race in quicksand that they cant get out of. So what we need to do is fix the ability and the capacity for individuals to save, because when individuals can save, they can actually have a future. Without the ability to save, you cant do shit. And thats how Bitcoin fixes poverty, thats how Bitcoin gives people in worse areas a chance to get ahead. Like, imagine being in Venezuela and doing the best work of your life  producing something really good  and at the end of the week what you earn is fucking worth 80% less. Why even try? Like, why even try? It doesnt work. Like, you have to be able to save in order to get ahead. And theres no point in even fucking trying if you cant get ahead. And by fixing that, I think Bitcoins second, third, and subsequent-order effects fix a lot of other things in society.", "image": null}

If you go to commercial banking, well with commercial banks youve got treasury services for companies, and youve got credit lines. So corporations  like individuals in a way  Ive got a bunch of cash, I want to generate yield on it. Call that treasury services. Or I have a lot of assets and I want to generate yield on them. And I also want to borrow against my assets. And so I need a commercial grade bank to do that. I tend to have slightly different requirements and Im going to move in greater scale and I may have different accounting issues, but the commercial banking application and the retail banking are pretty similar. Exchanges are another application of Bitcoin. There, people that want to trade assets and derivatives against each other. And you can imagine infinite assets and derivatives. They will be compliance-heavy. Do you need to comply with the CFTC or the SEC or who knows what? And that gets very complicated. But its a big business. The next big area of applications will be corporations. And here, any company that simply buys Bitcoin becomes an application of Bitcoin. And this is not a technical application. If we take Microstrategy as an example: when Microstrategy buys Bitcoin, then Microstrategy stock becomes a derivative of Bitcoin. And now Microstrategy stock is being traded on a NASDAQ, a regulated exchange. So what you did is you took one asset sitting on the blockchain and you used that to back another asset, an equity, thats trading on the NASDAQ, and then you back a third asset  calls and puts and leaps  that are trading on a futures exchange like the CME, and you may even issue debt that trades privately over the counter through a set of broker dealers. Each of those are applications of Bitcoin. Well how big are they? They could be a billion, $10 billion, you could have $100 billion worth of these applications. Why do they exist? Because people want them. Because there are a lot of people that want to trade stocks on NASDAQ, they dont want to trade Bitcoin on Coinbase. Why dont they want to? Because they took a decade to raise $100 billion and they promised a bunch of pension funds that they would only trade equities on NASDAQ and now it would take them another 5 years to reach that expectation with the pension funds. Maybe they want that because  like there are companies that do convertible arbitrage. They have $10 billion dollars, they raised it from pension funds and endowments, and they do convertible arbitrage. Thats their strategy. And that means they have to be able to buy the convertible debt and short the stock and try to generate a yield. And theyve got billions of dollars to do that thing, they get up, thats what they want to buy. Theres a phrase in Wall Street: when the ducks are quacking, feed the ducks. If the ducks want to buy convertible debt, give them convertible debt. If they want to buy equity, give them equity. If they wanted to buy Bitcoin, then they would want to buy Bitcoin. But these applications have different needs. If youre a consumer, you want to download Square Cash App and you want to smash buy $37 worth of Bitcoin and you want to do it in two clicks. You dont really want a super-complicated trading console with like 16 Bloomberg screens with futures and options and 3,700 trading pairs. Thats not what you want. You want to smash buy $37. So sometimes simplicity is the right thing. Sometimes you want simpler than that. Sometimes youve been doing business with the same private wealth or client adviser, you want to call him on the phone and day buy $10,000 worth of that Bitcoin, and you want them to buy the Bitcoin ETF. And the pure Bitcoin maximalist will say youre crazy! You should store $10,000 on your own hardware wallet. Okay well Im 82 years old and Im in a wheelchair and my hands shake and I dont use computers  how am I supposed to store this on a hardware wallet? Im just buying it as an investment instead of buying gold and Ive got 5 seconds. So you have 5 seconds and you talk to a guy Bill that youve been doing business with from Merrill Lynch. You know Merrill Lynch was a company on its own before it was bought by Bank of America. So I talk to my guy BillIve been talking to him for 30 years. I have 5 seconds and I want to buy $10,000 worth of Bitcoin. Okay, does that application matter? Sure it does. What if I want to buy $10 million worth of Bitcoin? Does that matter? Sure it does. What if I want to buy $100 million worth of Bitcoin? Its the same dude with the same 5 seconds, okay? So do applications scale the Bitcoin network? Yeah, absolutely. Would it be helpful to have more? Theyre all handles. Theyre a handle  Im grabbing onto Bitcoin. People handle it different ways. If I have PayPal its installed on my machine and it works and I can click on a button in 1 second and buy Bitcoin. I prefer that to downloading a better application that takes 37 clicks and takes 2 days to get authenticated. So at the end of the day, these applications make a big difference, and what you have going on here is the creation of financial applications being wound into other exchanges and other platforms. And the platforms are everything. For example, a corporation on the NYSE takes you to the NYSE platform. A corporation on the NASDAQ takes you to the NASDAQ platform. A corporation in Japan takes you to the Nikkei trading platforms. So as Bitcoin spreads on the balance sheets of different companies and different governments, it spreads onto different platforms and it morphs into different derivatives and different flavors.", "image": null}

{"title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 17 | How Bitcoin Changes Everything", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-17-how-bitcoin-changes-everything-6810e5bb3110?source=user_profile---------6-------------------------------", "body": "Yeah I would agree. Its the base property protocol or the base monetary protocol if what you want to do is to build something on a stable monetary base or a stable value base then you need digital money, digital property. And thats a little bit differently than digital currency, right? If you want a good digital currency, youre best to base it on a good digital money. Currency is an application of money. And if you understand it that way, money is the base layer, the end-all, be-all source of all value and virtue. And everything else is an application on top of it. I mean I dont need 100% of everything I am to be in my currency. I only need 1% of everything I own to be in the currency, and then 99% of what I am I need to be in the money. And in fact, if the money has integrity, the currency doesnt need to. Which is a pretty important point. If I had 99% of my wealth in the money and if the economy was growing or my assets are growing at 4% a year and if 1% was in the currency and the currency was devaluing at 10% per year, it wouldnt matter because its on the margin. Im getting wealthier faster than Im dissipating energy. And its the same with a lot of things in life. The $5 that falls out of my pocket on a Saturday night isnt going to impoverish me. And on the margin you could say well youre kind of crazy to carry cash to a bar on a Saturday night. I know but Ill take the risk, for the convenience. Each of these things is putting value at risk. For example if you have $1 billion in a company you have the counterparty risk of the billion dollars in the company. If the company fails or the companys defrauded then the billion disappears but it doesnt imperil the entire blockchain. And publicly traded company that files quarterly results is a lot more trustworthy counterparty. Like Microstrategy is able to issue debt backed by Bitcoin, but were a public company. If you were a private company and you also wanted to issue debt backed by Bitcoin, it would either be harder, impossible, or you might pay a higher interest rate. And if you were an entity, an individual that nobody trust and you went and you tried to sell the same bond maybe you wouldnt get it because people are taking counterparty risk. And theyre trying to figure out whether they trust the counterparty. But now here you see the Bitcoin which is: everybody can have an application. So the question is: which exchange is going to embrace Bitcoin most effectively? Which mobile app is going to embrace Bitcoin most effectively? Which commercial bank will? Which corporation will? Which government will? Any government or municipality could issue a billion dollars in municipal bonds at 2% interest, they could buy a billion dollars of Bitcoin that has 100% yield, they could scrape the arbitrage and they could generate a billion dollars a year, right? In appreciation. You play the game right, in theory you could just issue a bunch of debt, buy the Bitcoin, eliminate taxes forever. Now youre like, Well that sounds too good to be true! Well everybody cant do it. If youre last, it doesnt work that well. For example, Mark Zuckerberg was first to own Facebook stock so hes rich forever. You cant get rich forever by buying Facebook stock now. Whats the difference between you and Zuckerberg? The different is he was first and you were last. And the same is true with Jeff Bezos. So if youre the first city and you move early then as everybody else enters its like if you came to America first and you got 1,000 miles of farmland  Lord Baltimore. You get a better deal than if you show up 9 generations late. So with this youve got a market dynamic where the first government, the first city, the first state, the first country, they can all seize an advantage. And theyre competing. I talked to an energy company the other day, I said, Well youre an energy company but you know what? You can either sell your energy to Bitcoin miners and get paid 2 cents a kilowatt-hour and you could sell your excess energy  small idea, or you could become a Bitcoin miner and you could mine with all your excess energy and make 40 cents a kilowatt-hour  better idea, or you can go big and you can buy a bunch of Bitcoin miners and/or mine it, and then you can go issue billions of dollars of debt at 2% interest and buy the Bitcoin, and then make billions of billions of dollars. If you want to make $5 billion if youre an energy company, buy $5 billion of Bitcoin and issue a press release and then wait 90 days and youll probably make $5$10 billion. Do you want to bend over and do that? Now thats a bigger idea. But the biggest idea is: you do all those things, you reposition your company, and your revenue multiple doubles or triples because now youre not a sleepy regulated entity, youre a high-tech company. These big energy companies, you could have 20, 30, 40 billion in revenue and trade at $40 billion market cap. Well its likely that a $2 billion Bitcoin miner will trade with a $40 billion market cap. What if the Bitcoin miners start buying the energy companies? It happened with UUNet and Worldcom back in the day where you actually saw the Internet companies buying the baby bells, buying the Telcos. And maybe they dont, but the bigger idea is the utility companies are in competition with the tech companies, and theyre in competition with the financiers and the hedge funds and the traders and the governments. Bitcoin doesnt care.", "image": null}

If youre there first and youre right youre going to benefit the most. This is true in Bitcoin as well if youre there first youre going to benefit more than later adopters. This is also the problem with fiat in a way that the central bank has arrogated itself to always be first. It always gets to allocate itself new shares of currency, so its kind of hijacked the hierarchy of wealth in fiat.", "image": null}
{"title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 17 | How Bitcoin Changes Everything", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-17-how-bitcoin-changes-everything-6810e5bb3110?source=user_profile---------6-------------------------------", "body": "Yeah and in Bitcoin, the courageous with clarity, a vision, get to make themselves first. Its private market in money, and with fiat its those that are politically connected that stay first. So its public money. Its worthwhile to say: all of those organizations are competing, but we have other types of derivatives that are very interesting, or other applications of Bitcoin. Like lets take insurance: if youre an insurance company then every insurance policy you issue or annuity that you sell based on Bitcoin becomes a Bitcoin derivative. So if I want to sell you a life insurance policy that pays off a million dollars when you die and Im going to charge you x premium  Ive got to charge you enough premiums and invest them to pay off the million dollars, so if I charge it as premiums then I invest them at 2% or 3% yield its kind of hard to pay off the million. I have to charge you a high premium. Whereas if I charge you premiums, invest them in Bitcoin, I can lower the premium. Or I can raise the payout. Or I can make the payout variable. So now youve got an insurance company thats created a differentiated insurance product, and you can either do it explicitly by offering the policy backed by Bitcoin, or you can do it implicitly on your balance sheet. You could just take $50 billion of your balance sheet that are your collected annuities or premiums and you could buy Bitcoin with it and use it collectively to back all your policies at the corporate level. And of course insurance companies have long-durations, they have to look out 3040 years, theyre in business forever, they have huge balance sheets, and their traditional funding vehicle is bonds and bonds are broken. And so you need a better type of annuity generating asset or a better appreciating asset and thats where Bitcoin comes in. And thats where investment firms come in. I mean, my next application  youve got an investment firm and you sell mutual funds or you sell investment funds and people invest with you. So if you create the fund based on Bitcoin and then you sell that, that becomes an instrument thats interesting to corporate investors, family offices, individual investors. Theres a lot of people that will want to buy that fund, and theres an entire industry that sells those funds. Theres also an interesting hybrid twist on that, like if you look at Fidelity, Fidelity sells all sorts of fixed income funds  municipal bond funds, sovereign debt funds, corporate bond funds, junk bond funds. They all have a low yield and theyve got a negative real yield. Well you can juice them by blending them with Bitcoin. So if I have an instrument or an asset thats been going up 100% a year and I blend it in to an asset thats been paying 3% interest, now Ive created a hybrid instrument thats got downside protection of bonds but upside opportunity of something  maybe not as much. Its like sucralose, a powerful sweetener. Its a booster, a sugar. So for an investment fund you can blend various types of funds. What if youre 50% Bitcoin and the other 50% is Bitcoin derivatives  call and future collar options. Maybe you collar the Bitcoin or maybe youre 50% Bitcoin and then youre selling covered calls out of the money to generate yield. So youre creating a Bitcoin yield fund. It doesnt have the same upside as Bitcoin but its got a guaranteed  at some point downside protection, upside yield, youre blending the thing and youre selling it to someone that wants to buy that. Are there people that want to buy it? Sure. In a way, Microstrategy issues a bond, 6 1/8% interest, and we go and buy Bitcoin with it. If you swap the two, youve given up the upside of Bitcoin in return for the guarantee of 6 1/8% interest. And why do you do that? Because the government is paying you 1% interest. Because the spread is 500 basis points over sovereign debt, and because the spread over investment-grade corporate debt is 400 basis points. So you want the yield. Who wants the yield? Well somebody that actually sold $100 billion of a high-yield fund to an endowment  thats who wants the yield, right? So there are structures in the financial universe. You dont just snap your fingers and change those structures in a day, week, month, or a year. In some cases those structures have formed over 10, 30, 40 years. 10 years is a short period of time in the finance world. So what you have here is investment firms that are able to create all their own financial products with any mixture and blend of risk and volatility and they can hybridize them with existing conventional assets. What if you had a fund which was half gold, half Bitcoin? For people that like gold but they cant bear to give up  or they like Bitcoin but they cant bear to give up their gold. Its like an alloy, right?", "image": null}

If you went to every conventional investor and said, Are you willing to give up more than 30% upside a year in return for all these downside protections? Yeah theres a lot. And big banks sell these all the time. Theyre very lucrative products. Like I charge you a 2% fee to give you a structured product that gives you some mixture of downside protection and upside that we tailored to your needs. So those are just other applications. Moving on, lets talk about trust and endowments. Youve got a family trust thats supposed to last 100 years. Fund it with Bitcoin. The Rockefeller Foundation, right? If you have any kind of endowment, every university, every non-profit has an endowment. They all have the same funding problem, which is: where do you put your money where it will last 100 years? And here this is an interesting  its a digital transformation of money managers. I can either put $100 million into an endowment and have like 10 money managers and they charge me a 12% fee a year to manage the money, or I can just put the money into Bitcoin and Ive dematerialized the money managers. We talked about the complete digital transformation or dematerializing of the fiat banking system in our early sessions. In this particular case youre just dematerializing money managers. But theres an application: the application would be, I need a certain type of reporting and compliance. Like what if you did run a non-profit foundation and you wanted to be a custodian of $12 million? You want to flip it into Bitcoin and now you want to spend 1 hour a year monitoring your position, filing the appropriate forms with the IRS, and then you need to make disbursements. So if youre an endowment what you probably want is a credit line so you can borrow some money to pay your disbursements  your fees  on an ongoing basis. And then you want the principle to be protected. Normally you would have to re-invest it. Well whats the closest thing to Bitcoin? Probably the Vanguard 500 or the like. And if you look at Vanguard and Fidelity and you look at what they do, one big business for them is this endowment management or donor-assisted funds and they just run these funds where you put your money in this stuff and you put it on autopilot and people look at it once every 90 days. And thats a big business. Right now, $100 trillion of it is broken, because $100 trillion of it is bonds. And so youve got massive amounts of fixed income bonds and other assets that are broken, and those are traditionally the things that are easy to manage. And if you cant do $100 trillion of bonds you have to get into equity. But theres not enough equity. So if the equity markets in the US were $35 trillion and youve got $100 trillion in bonds that are broken, you cant just jam $50 trillion into equity. You can, but what are the consequences? You overvalue the equity, right? I mean I cant imagine any of those examples right? Yeah! Lots of examples. We overvalue the equity as we jam the money into it. And then people are waking up and theyre looking for that ultimate asset-class, and the beauty of Bitcoin is Bitcoin can never be overvalued because Bitcoin is a bank in cyberspace. If you jam $50 trillion into it the price would go up by $50 trillion and it would be worth $50 trillion more.", "image": null}

Now I talked about a bunch of financial applications and also about corporations and governments as platforms, but we should also talk about hardware applications. Theres a lot of hardware applications in Bitcoin. Theres the miners, nodes, wallets. Any device that exists could have Bitcoin protocol built into it. And the question is: do you want to build the wallet protocols? You can build Lightning and you can build Bitcoin wallet right into any mobile device. You can build it into jewelry, right? You can build multisig into your watches, your jewelry, your phones, your desks, your appliances. And thats the differentiating business. Like people build Bluetooth into stuff. This is more important than Bluetooth. A bit more important. You can also build nodes and node capabilities right into devices, and you can build mining into devices. You could integrate these capabilities right into firmware, into hardware. And why would you do it? Because its differentiating. If Apple builds Bitcoin support into Face ID or Touch ID on the iCloud, if the iCloud was like a multisig, multi-factor Bitcoin cloud, then youve got a trillion dollars worth of Bitcoin that can flow into the iCloud. That differentiates iCloud. You can do it with Google Cloud, you can do it in Microsoft. You can do it in Facebook. And so Apples interesting because it crosses hardware and software and network areas, but if you go into the software area youve got Windows and iOS and Android and these are all operating systems. And to a certain extent things like Chrome are like their own mini operating system. You can build Bitcoin right into those things. Google built password managers into Chrome, right? And if the operating system has native support for the monetary protocol, then either thats a reason to use the operating system, or you can pass on those primitives and that functionality to the applications running on the operating system. Like, for example, Apple lets banking applications use Face ID for authentication. And that makes the banking application better. So if you want to compete in hardware and devices or in software operating systems, then putting the monetary protocol into it is just like building TCP/IP. I mean Im old enough to remember when the TCP/IP wasnt built into every computer.", "image": null}

Its probably outside the scope of our conversation here, its like an entirely other world. But with hardware and software that leads you to Cloud, right, because Cloud is another application. AWS, Azure, Google Cloud and the like are all general purpose, containerized corporate platforms for spinning up massive applications. So to the extent that they have support for Bitcoin or Lightning and certain other monetary protocols, then it makes it easier for their clients like Zoom. You know Zoom went from nothing to 400 million users during Covid because they were sitting on top of Cloud platforms from an Azure or an AWS and if they werent they couldnt have scaled. So when theyre scaling they need to be able to access these underlying services, and monetary services are destined to be built into every application. And they would be a differentiator. Now if we go to another really interesting application, take social networks. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok. Well, one of the killer applications for social networks is verification and credit-worthiness. Another way to say it is to put skin in the game. Right now theres no cost for malicious behavior, so if I open up my Instagram Direct Messages, 99% of them are bots, theyre not really people. And when I look in my Twitter comments, a lot of times 90% of them will be bots or malicious actors. So weve got a bot war. People have computers spinning up fake Twitter accounts and then Twitter has computers taking them down as fast as they can, and in the first hour after I post I just see a bunch of garbage. And then after a day after they clean it up I see real comments. Well what that means is theres a 2, 3, 4, 5 hour delay between when I do something and when I dont have garbage in the feed. How do you solve it? Well the logical way to solve it is I put 100,000 satoshis on a Lightning wallet and then I make a security deposit to Twitter. Or a security deposit to Instagram, or YouTube. And if you deposit  thats like $40, pick a number, it doesnt matter what the number is, something less than a lot but more than nothing  I deposit 100,000 satoshis and then people on Twitter can say I only want people with an orange check that are credit-worthy or Lightning-certified to be able to post comments on my Tweets. And I only want to receive Direct Messages from people that are Lightning-certified or verified or I follow  one of those three. And if youre not an orange check well call it, then you cant message me and you cant comment. So what happens? Well first of all if I just turned my entire feed to only orange check and blue check, all the bots disappear. Everything disappears. CZ does this on Binance a different way, he basically blocks everybody but people he follows from being able to post on his Twitter comments. But the problem with that is if youre only following 1,000 people, youre living in this hermetically sealed world of only 1,000 who can comment. What you want is 100 million people to be able to comment but you want them to comment with civility, or at least you want them to be human beings. So if 100 million people post $30, then youve got $3 billion worth of Bitcoin posted as a security deposit on the Twitter network. Now everybody that comments is a real person  well lets say 98% of them are, and if someone wants to spin up 29 Michael Saylor bots, well they can do that but theyre not orange checked and so Ill never see them. And no one will ever see them. Or if they want to get the orange check theyll have to post 100,000 sats 29 times. And if it turns out that they were imitating somebody, maybe they get a fine of 1000 sats or maybe they just lose their orange check and they forfeit the security deposit. Its like if you trash somebodys house when youre renting it. Whenever you rent a house or whenever you cross public properly, you either have to have insurance like car insurance, or you have to be bonded if youre a worker, or you have to post a security deposit. And if you have that concept that you have to be bonded or have to be credit-worthy, then what that means is that every time a bot attacks you it costs them $30 and youre monetizing maliciousness. If someones stupid enough to be malicious. Its not that the platforms dont have rules  they do have rules. They take people down and kick them off and put them into the penalty box all the time. But the rules dont have consequences. If you have a computer that generates 87 million Michael Saylor bots every day, what the heck do you care about the rules. The rules dont hurt robots. There has to be a price or a cost to maliciousness. And so what you have here is a Bitcoin Lightning network that allows a billion people to post $20 each. And then you can have micropayments. And when that happens, if I go on Amazon, I look at the opinion surveys, I dont have to worry that someone created fake bots to fill in the survey. Because if you get caught faking it, you get a fine. And if I go on YouTube and someones running a scam video and they have to have the right green check and then when they get  we report scam videos every 2 hours, Robert. Every 2 hours someone spins up a scam video on YouTube which fakes something and we report them as fast as they spin up. But theres no cost. Or theres minimal cost to denial of service attacks. Theres no cost to spamming. Theres no cost to hostility online. Theres no cost to being an imposter. Theres no cost to spinning up 97,000 fake accounts that actually try to create the appearance of a panic when it doesnt exist  cyber warfare. So whats the solution? The solution is: in the real world you have skin in the game. If you walk up to women in the street and you insult them, you take the risk that the person next to them or they punch you in the face. And if you drive your car and you get in a wreck you get fined and then you get an insurance claim and theres a consequence. And if you go rent someones house for the summer and you trash the house and you have a security deposit, they take it. Or if you rent an apartment with a security deposit and you trash it, they take it. So theres skin in the game and that causes people to act with some degree of civility. Theres no civility in cyberspace because theres no skin in the game. Why not? Well because if you use credit cards theres a 2.5% fee, it takes 2 days to clear and 2 billion people dont have credit cards, among other things. You do it through the App Store, well you could try to do it through the App Store, theres a 30% cut. How do you move 1000 satoshis for 1 satoshi in a split second? So having a value network becomes a credit network, and so for all these social networks you can actually inject the quality of credit-worthiness. And you could do it different scales. You could post 100,000 sats to get a small check, you could post 1 BTC to get a green check, you could post 10 BTC to get a purple check, and if Im going to go ahead and scalp tickets or Im going to book a flight from someone online, I want them to have a purple check because I want recourse from them if they lie to me or if theyve defrauded me.", "image": null}

Proof of work to fight spam. Well were living in a world 30 years later and we still have spam! Like were running two levels of spam filters at my company. 90% of my e-mail is spam. Im getting spammed on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter. All of the news feeds are getting spammed. And its worse than spam, there are hostile, malicious actors that are fake bots that are waging a psychological psyops warfare to destroy people and ideas and demoralize them. And they do it for economic reasons, political reasons, etc. And there is no way to stop that in the absence of some kind of value network. So the killer app for Bitcoin with social networks is credit-worthiness leading to cyber-security. Safety and civility in cyberspace. Now if you think about where you can apply this idea of just a security deposit  which is the same as the cyber-bond if you will, or a cyber-passport  the beauty is that you dont have to disclose your identity. You could spin it up and spin it down and its lightning-fast and dirt-cheap so its open to everybody. But once you spin up this idea, it works across every social network, it cleans up all of the feeds, the news feeds, etc. It also works for all the communication networks. So youve got Whatsapp, Signal, iMessage, Zoom, Gmail, every other mail, Office365  all of these things have spam imposters, malicious accounts. The phishing attacks are ridiculous. So if youre a corporation and you want to send something, maybe you ought to post  if someone sent me a mail message and I knew they posted a 1,000 BTC security deposit and if they had it all at risk and if they could lose it instantly on the platform, I would be probably trust them more. Like its all about cyber-reputation. If you really want me to do something risky, what do you have at risk? Whats your value at risk? Now whats interesting about this is youre picking up all these security deposits, the platforms could use the float to do something if they wanted. And its generally good for Bitcoin because it locks up the Bitcoin on the platforms. And the skys the limit. Once youve done that, youve not that far from implementing fees. You could say, Look you want to send me a message, pay me 1000 sats. You can have micropayments, you could have streaming payments, you can tie services to credit-worthiness. If you go to a bank and you put a bunch of money in the bank theyll give you a higher level of service than if you put a small amount. So if you want to have distinguished services whatever they might be  it might be more bandwidth on Spaces or some other functionality. But everybody eventually can become a bank. And that takes us to entertainment/news. They have similar opportunities. They either sell access via these micropayments, or they curate the response, they create safer forms and safer spaces by requiring that you be credit-worthy in order to engage. Or they certify their news by posting some credit-worthiness. Theres a lot of news circulating so if youre trying to separate fake news from real news, then you could use this to certify. You could also have service providers like Uber, OpenTable, AirBNB, and for them the idea of credit-worthiness also matters. It matters when youre pairing customers with restaurants. Like can I trust my customer to show up to the restaurant? Can I trust the driver? Can I trust the passenger? Can I trust the person thats going to come into my AirBNB? They tried to do this with reputation, but there is no more important metric I think than the credit-worthiness. If someone says Ill post $10 million in order to drive your car for the weekend, its highly unlikely that theyre going to trash your car. And one way or the other, its just an example of an insurance policy or a bond. If you have the recourse to the bond in cyberspace, then it creates accelerated commerce, and that means that millions of people can trade with millions of people without the impedance of getting to know each other.", "image": null}

If you have an open website, there are hostile actors in Eastern Europe and theyll unleash an array of machines and theyll just start hammering your website to take it down and it happens all the time. Its like spamming except its worse. Thats because theres no cost for denial of service. But a lot of the proof of work and the Bitcoin protocol was to protect the underlying Bitcoin mining network from denial of service attacks, right? But this actually solves the problem. If you have a web service and you require someone to have an orange check, you could actually filter on the orange check and you could then prevent the denial of service attack. You can protect yourself from it. Again, like having a credit rating in cyberspace. And since its open to everybody in the world, anybody can have one, and it causes 98% of the malicious behavior to be non-economic anymore. It doesnt make any sense. So I didnt spend much time on retail but clearly retail is another example of a layer 3 application of Bitcoin. And its either buying, selling, trading, security deposits or credit checks or the like as youre doing business. If Im selling something to someone and I trust them and I trust their credit rating, maybe you can do business with retailers friction-free that dont know you and you dont know them, right? And it definitely is the case that if Im Amazon or Im setting up a retail operation, people are coming at me that I dont know very well. So what I want to do is find a way to accelerate the transactional speed and I do that with some type of Lightning security deposit and/or Lightning payment. We didnt really touch on the elephant in the room here which is the Visa and MasterCard network costs 2.5%. Just the general payments network and the remittance network is another killer application. Just money movement around the planet, because the existing systems either bank wires  and small sums of money is credit cards, and you have knock-off periods. They dont move on the weekends, they dont move from certain jurisdictions to others, you cant program them, theyre not automated. So youve got a heterogeneous expensive manual patchwork quilt of payment options. And you cant scale that. So Lightning helps you scale it at the transaction level, and then Bitcoin is the core settlement network. So if you want to plug 100,000 businesses into each other and move blocks of money a million to $100 million or $1 billion at a time you do it on the Bitcoin network, and then when you want to plug the millions and tens and hundreds of millions of people into each other, youve got to do it on these other platforms. But it wont be one. I think Lightning will be very successful, but I think that Square, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google, Facebook, they will all build their own proprietary networks and they will have additional functionality or compliance or performance or convenience built into it. Like if I bought an insurance policy a decade ago and if the insurance company just buys Bitcoin for their balance sheet, I now own a Bitcoin derivative insurance policy and I did nothing. So there are certain subtleties where the corporation or the actor can do something that provides a benefit to millions of people without them doing anything, and thats how you really scale in a big way. Like if youre a country and all of a sudden you start buying Bitcoin, your currency in circulation with 11 million people using has become a Bitcoin derivative, and it happened because someone in the back office started buying Bitcoin. So the beauty of all this is: theres a lot of ways to scale Bitcoin and theres a lot of applications. Theres hundreds of thousands of applications  millions of applications. There will be lots of platforms, tools. If Twitter creates the orange check and they plug it into the Lightning Network, then whos to say that Twitter couldnt open up the API and let Google and Facebook and Apple and Medium and Reddit and Discord inherit the orange check. Twitter becomes a platform for cyber-security, and you carry your Twitter reputation or credit rating to all these other places. I mean thats what Google tries with their Google log-in and Apple has Apple log-in. Theyre carrying authentication around the network. Theres no end to the type of opportunities that there are there, and youre only limited by human creativity.", "image": null}

So what you have is you have Bitcoin as a decentralized crypto-asset network and the thing that pops up a lot is the question of, What is energy usage look like over time? And is energy usage going to keep increasing as the price of Bitcoin increases? And Ive seen commentary on this, I think a lot of people get it wrong. They seem to think that as the price of Bitcoin increases the energy usage will increase linearly. If theres a 100x increase in Bitcoin price theres a 100x in energy usage. And I think its just worthwhile to make the observation that over the past 10 years the mining network has gone from being energy-intensive to being technology-intensive. Another way to say it is that in every single industry you go from being labor-intensive to capital-intensive. When we started with a million people sowing or farming, farming it was a labor-intensive activity. As the capital equipment gets better, first you have horses and carts and ox-carts, and then you have tractors, then you have mega-tractors, then you have factories. All of a sudden, the amount of labor matters a lot less, and the amount of capital equipment matters a lot more. There was a time when 90% of the country was farmers and now just 12% of the people in the country produce all the food, because its become technology-intensive. The Bitcoin network is similar except substitute for labor, energy. And substitute for capital, technology. If we go back 10 years, it probably took 100x as much energy to generate an exahash as it does right now. An S19 takes 30 megawatts per exahash, but an S9 takes 150 megawatts per exahash, so youve got 5x improvement in energy efficiency over one generation of equipment. Were like on the 7th generation of mining equipment. If you go back 2 or 3 generations then you get that 100x increase in energy intensity. If you look at where we are today and you go forward 10 years, its reasonable to expect that you will get improvements in efficiency from three dynamics: youve got halvings in the protocol and we have one every 4 years so that means over the course of a decade you have a 5x increase in efficiency from the halvings, then if you have a 4x increase in energy efficiency and you get it twice  or a 5x then a 4x  you get a 20x increase over 2 more generations of hardware, and now youve got a 20x times a 5x or about a 100x increase in efficiency. So Bitcoin price could go up by 100x and the network efficiency would go up by 100x and the energy consumption could be flat. And thats an important thing to keep in mind because people sometimes think, Well energy is used to secure the network  No its crypto-energy. Its encrypted energy thats used to secure the network. And in order to get it from raw energy to crypto-energy you have to run it through a SHA-256 miner thats properly engineered in a heat-sink. And so as the heat engineering improves, the miners get more efficient, as the semi-conductor engineering for ASICs improves, the network gets more efficient. And what you have in that dynamic is a never-struggle between brute-force and technique. It kind of reminds you of something  like nature, and competition. Theres two ways to do things, right? You either use raw labor, or you use technology. And its important to have that dynamic, or that yin and yang, because when the technologists get lazy and they stop improving, then the raw material or the brute-force overwhelms and the control of the network shifts back to the energy holders. But to the extent that the technologists upgrade their engineering facilities, their heat technology, their chip technology, then the energy becomes less important. The technology becomes more important. And the combination of both of these things require free-flowing capital. In a free market the capital is continually seeking the best use. Should I invest money in creating the next generation of SHA-256 miners? Should I invest money in engineering a more efficient Bitcoin mine with immersion cooling? Should I invest money in commercializing more energy? Or plugging in more energy and just manufacturing the same design over and over again? So what you have is this nice delicate dance or balance of power. But a model you can think of is when we first started Bitcoin mining, it was all energy-intensive. We were using off-the-shelf computer equipment and you were throwing raw and power and raw commodity materials at it. Its rotated through a set of generations of hashing equipment. So now you need energy but the limiting factor is not with the energy, the limiting factor on generating hashes is the mining rigs. And maybe you could say the limiting factors on doing this well are the mining rigs properly installed in the right mining center with the right cooling technology. And if you look forward another decade, youll see its going to be much more technical-intensive. You could have all the energy in the world, but youre not going to be able to generate crypto-hashes. The break-even point of an S19 is like 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. You could pay [39] cents a kilowatt-hour for electricity and make money. The break-even point for an S9 is 8 or 9 cents a kilowatt-hour. If you have 20 cent power you cant make moneyyouve got to turn it off. The break-even point for the generation of equipment before that is like 2 cents per kilowatt-hour. You cant pay 3, you have to turn it off. And the generation before that youre down to half a penny a kilowatt-hour. So if youre looking to run antiquated equipment to generate hashes you have to be stealing the power. If you have free energy and its literally stolen or its given away, you can run 8 year old or 5 year old equipment. But if youre paying your way, you have to run modern equipment. So this is a dynamic model but its important because its a dynamic evolution of the sophistication of the Bitcoin security network that has Darwinian overtones. Because the Bitcoin miner that just buys a bunch of equipment 5 years ago and stops upgrading becomes obsolete. You wont last 10 years with that equipment. I mean your break-even point becomes a tenth of a penny once youre four generations behind. So this is like nature healing itself. Its a very natural process. If youre out of touch and youre 1,000 miles away, the free market somewhere else is going to keep moving the state of the art forward, and should you isolate yourself you will find that you cant generate enough hashpower to participate in the revenues and the transaction fees. And its the networks way of simply squeezing you off the network. Now what means is Bitcoin miners are organic creatures with a negative feedback loop. In essence a market mechanism. The difficulty adjustment is not just tactically every 2 weeks in the protocol. The difficulty adjustment is in the market, because if you dont upgrade your hardware every 4 years you become uncompetitive. And you cant upgrade your hardware every 4 years unless you were a responsible custodian of your capital. If you spent all your money, if you didnt save any money, if youre not trustworthy, if you dont have credit, you cant buy any equipment. And so to stay competitive on the Bitcoin network you have to be credit-worthy, you have to be competent, and you have to be credible. Someone that has the technology has to be willing to sell to you. And so I would say that the dynamic nature of the network is: you have this competition between miner, operations, and the technology providers, and the energy sources, and the political jurisdictions, and you have to be upgrading, and you probably need to be improving your efficiency by a factor of 1.52x every year. Youre subject to Moores Law and this competitive Darwinian pressure. The result of that is: energy consumption is going to fall per exahash. Well go from 150 megawatts an exahash to 30 megawatts an exahash, to 5 megawatts an exahash, to 1 megawatt an exahash, to half a megawatt  and on down. Were just going to move down this efficiency curve. You could imagine if I gave you this supercomputer the size of a sugar cube  look at the amount of power on a modern semi-conductor, right? Think about whats in the latest iPhone chip. We just keep compressing computing power and we find a way. And human ingenuity is like that. They will keep finding a way to create more hashpower using better technique. So that suggests that energy consumption will probably increase non-linearly, like with the log of the price. If the price goes up by a factor of 10x, energy consumption might go up by a factor of 2, 2.5, 3x. At some point you start to think you will roll over  youll peak. We might have already done it. You peak energy consumption and then you taper off or it holds constant as the hashrate increases, and instead of a Bitcoin miner spending half of their budget on energy, you roll over to spending half of your budget on capital. Youre buying capital and amortizing it, and pretty soon your variable cost on energy is 5% and 40% is capital equipment, and what youve got is not an energy war to see who controls the network, youve got a technology to see who controls the network. Why is that good? Well because energy is a raw material in the universe, but 7th generation SHA-256 miners are specialty equipment. Everybody on Earth can find some energy and throw it at the problem, but throwing the 11th generation of SHA-256 mining equipment at the problem is something that probably no ones going to be able to do unless they spent a decade or two decades engineering that equipment and thinking about it. So you have a specialization in the same way that John Deere tractors are specialized after 100 years. And if you went back to a farmer in 1850 and you describe what a farmer in 2020 can do, its like night and day. Thats whats going on with the network. And I think its self-healing, self-sealing, self-correcting, and the combination of the Darwinian and Adam Smith capitalist competition is a critical advantage for Bitcoin versus a proof of stake network. Because in the proof of stake network, you pretty much turn off energy competition, you turn off semi-conducter competition and innovation, you turn off engineering and heat engineering innovation, you turn off capital financial competition, you turn off the political element, and that means that I can get fat, dumb, and happy. I can just post a billion worth of my tokens and go to sleep for a decade and no one is trying to make a network so its not being tested, theres no stressing of it, and ultimately the problem with that is youre going to suffer in integrity and durability.", "image": null}

And this basically means as the capital becomes more plentiful and effective at amplifying labor, you need less labor to accomplish the same results. This is a natural, capitalistic progression.

Whats the price of energy? Is it going up or going down? Maybe the price of energy is going up and then its going down. Whats the price of semi-conductors? Is it going up or is it going down? Well sometimes its going up. Its going up if theres a monopoly on the semi-conductor chips, and then its going down when someone else enters the market. An Intel 386 chip is pretty cheap now, right? So chip prices are coming down but the next generation is going up. But again its a competitive thing. Whats the price of semi-conductors? If theres only one provider and its a monopoly then you could say, Well the price of your semi-conductors is going to go up every generation forever and the cost of Bitcoin mining is going to go up. But there isnt [only] one semi-conductor company. Theres multiple. If there is one, were back to Jeff Bezoss statement, Your margin is my opportunity. Bitcoin is an open market for mining, so anybody can engineer a SHA-256 chip. There is no one type of Bitcoin miner. There are people slapping these things in the back of trucks and driving them around and plugging them into bootlegged power lines, right? Its not very efficient. There are people that slap 500 Bitcoin miners into a container and they just drop it on top of a pad. Does it work? Sure it does. Is it properly heat-engineered? No. Does it get hot? Very. Whats the consequences of running hot? You have to turn off the mining equipment some of the time so you lose efficiency, and they burn out and their useful life is not 4 years, its 3 years. Or its 2 years. So theres a competition here and just like theres competition for energy, will energy go up forever? No energy could go to zero. If I invent cold fusion. Will semi-conductors go up forever? No. At some point Bitmain raises their prices and then everybody starts talking to Intel. You go to another semi-conductor company and you say, Well look Bitmains tripled their prices and now you can make this much. And now you draw somebody else into the space. So I think theres a dynamic equilibrium between the engineering and the semi-conductor and the energy. And the best capitalized companies, they can buy the new equipment. Like the publicly traded North American companies, they will go and buy all the new shiny equipment, and poorly capitalized companies will run the old equipment. And then you will roll forward like that. Its not clear to me how much it will cost to create a Bitcoin, because thats a function of  maybe the profitability of Bitcoin is a function of the rate at which we add hashpower versus the rate at which we add Bitcoin HODLers. If we increase the number of Bitcoin HODLers by a factor of 10x, and we increase the hashpower by a factor of 2x, then the profitability  the revenue per exahash  is going to go up by a factor of 5x, right? And if we increase the exahash by a factor of 10x and the HODLers by a factor of 2x, the profitability is going to deteriorate. So the profitability of the Bitcoin mining is going to have an impact on the rate of development of Bitcoin mining semi-conductor ASICs, right?", "image": null}

But if once every 4 years I upgrade the equipment and its 5x faster, now the question is: how much did you pay for the equipment? And the answer is: if you paid a lot for the equipment  now amortize the cost of the equipment into the cost of the Bitcoin, and you get an answer. But thats a price that a vendor charges you, which could be triple or half depending upon the competition. In a very competitive market, well lets say it a different way  if youre buying Intel grade 38646 chips and slapping them into your home appliance, what is the price of the intelligence that you put inside your toaster? As a percentage of the cost of the toaster? Its pretty cheap, right? Like at some point the cost of intelligence starts to drop because its a commodity market, AMD drove down the prices and so everybody can put intelligence into their appliance because of competition. If there was no competition it might go the opposite way. So I think that protocol guarantees us through halvings that were going to have to get 5x as efficient every decade, but the other dynamics like the rate of technology advance go even faster. And theyre just as much. I do agree with you on this one idea: were in a gold rush right now. Or a Bitcoin rush. Between now and like 2035  in 2035 well have mined 99% of the Bitcoin. So youve got 14 years, and during the 14 years the block rewards are pretty high relatively speaking. And so its very lucrative to be in the business, but the business is going to become less profitable, likely. At the very least we know its going to rotate into a transaction-fee business. So instead of 90% block reward 10% transaction fee, you could expect 90% transaction fee 10% block reward. And the transaction fees are also going to scale more likely with the log of the price, not linear to the price. If I want to move a million dollars I might pay you $10, and if I want to move $10 million I would pay $12 but Im not going to pay $100. Im just going to overbid the million dollar buyer. And if I want to move $50 million Ill bid $14. So the transaction fees will increase with the number of transactions on the base layer, and thatll be a dynamic. But the block rewards go away. And so if youre a Bitcoin miner its a very lucrative high-growth business right now, but it will move toward an efficient transaction security network later, and you would do well to buy Bitcoin. Thats why it makes sense to HODL Bitcoin if youre a Bitcoin miner, because its your hedge against two things: its a hedge against the inevitable protocol  which the protocol says Bitcoin mining is going to get 90% less lucrative over the course, cut in half once, cut in half twice. Over the course of 12 years you get cut in half three times. So its a hedge against that but thats the long term. Its also a hedge against the near-term hashrate explosion. If youre mining Bitcoin right now and if somebody comes out of the blue and they bring a lot of hashrate on the network faster than you expected then your market share gets cut. In that situation [HODLing] Bitcoin may win. If everybody believes that Bitcoin will win and theres a flood of people that enter the mining business, you want to own Bitcoin. Minings going to get competitive, Bitcoins going to get more valuable. So you definitely dont want to be in a situation where youve mined Bitcoin, you sell all your Bitcoin for cash  in that case youre attempting to run a cash business in 16 years when the revenues been cut in half four times. Presumably if you cut a 100 to 50 to 25 to 12 to 6, when youre generating 6% of the revenue and everybody else has had 16 years to get in the game, its going to be more of a commodity business. Now thats not to say that a Bitcoin miner cant compete and evolve, it may be a great business then too. It may be that Bitcoin miners evolve to be running Lightning nodes or running layer 2 platforms of other sorts. It might be that as a Bitcoin miner you have a huge Bitcoin treasury and then you can generate yield on it. It might be that there are other applications. Well talk about some. Its very logical for Bitcoin miners maybe to get into some of these other application areas that will pop up in time. And there are technology possibilities here. So I would say the illogical thing to do in business is you dont worry about what happened 1620 years out if you can make a ton of money now. I mean you might very well make enough money now to have 10, 20, 30, 100 billion dollars of capital then, at which point you can go buy something else to get you in the business. And my other point I guess here is: yes its true, Bitcoin miners should keep Bitcoin. But its also true that non-Bitcoin miners should keep Bitcoin. Like if you believe in Bitcoin, then the logic follows that no matter business youre in, if you have operating income, you should invest in Bitcoin. And if you are able to generate financing, if you can raise debt or equity then you should also raise debt and invest that in Bitcoin. That would be the case for other companies. Microstrategy looks at it that way and were not even a Bitcoin miner. But thats my thought on the Bitcoin mining network and the dynamic model over time. I think that some people intentionally misunderstand this, like proof of stakers, they intentionally misunderstand because if they misunderstand it then they can assume that energy consumption is linear, and then they can play the ESG card and pretend that theyre virtue-signaling and say that theyre doing something good for the environment because theyre not using energy. But the truth is that theyre not using energy nor are they using technology. Theyre not using hardware technology, engineering technology, or energy, nor are they submitting their network to competition, and theyre not using external capital, political or financial. What theyre doing is theyre creating a virtual protocol in order to create security. And even there, if youre going to rely upon a virtual protocol to create security youd be better off to stake the protocol with an asset that is outside of the network, that is external to the network. So for example, the Lightning Network makes a lot more sense because its staked with Bitcoin, than if it was staked with Lightning Coin.", "image": null}

Its a crypto-universe. Satoshi played God, you either call it creating your own universe and setting the planets in motion by defining the space-time constant, or the other metaphor is you released a creature into cyberspace and set the genetic DNA of the creature. You controlled how it will procreate. And once you release the thing, then it spreads as some kind of swarm life-form continually evolving. So I think with that we conclude that the Bitcoin mining network and the Bitcoin network in general is quite a wonderful thing. Now the next question is: how does it scale? If we go beyond the network, the primary purpose of the Bitcoin mining network is to provide security and enforce protocol integrity and durability of the system. And it does that very well. But so how do we actually scale out to provide hundreds of billions of transactions a day to billions of people on the planet at the speed of light using the latest computer technology? Thats I think where a lot of people fall down, they just want to look at the base chain and say, Well it moves 7 transactions a seconds and so you cant scale. But they lack the imagination to understand the consequences of the layering. So the Bitcoin monetary network, it scales based upon platforms at the layer 2 level, and then applications above that level, and you could call them layer 3 applications or you could call them applications on top of applications on top of applications. So you could have layers 4, 5, 6, and 7 and you could have interplay between the applications, but for the purposes of our discussion lets just call them layer 2 platforms and layer 3 applications in order to keep from getting too confusing in our semantics. So whats the most important one? Well Lightning is a very interesting and maybe the most important layer 2 platform. And the idea behind Lightning is: I want something to be exponentially faster and exponentially cheaper and in return Im willing to secure exponentially less money. So if I have only $100 at risk, then theres no reason why I couldnt do 10 million transactions on that channel. And that totally makes sense because as you scale out, if you look at the transactions that 8 billion people need to make on this planet every single day, the majority of the transactions are actually of value less than one dollar. In fact there are plenty of transactions that could be valued in pennies. And then the big transactions might be $10, $100, or $1,000. Probably if you were to look at the transaction stream on the Visa network or the MasterCard network, the average check is like $28 or something. But theres billions and billions and billions of them. So you dont really need the final settlement security of Bitcoin, because thats the highest level of security in the world. And youre getting that to move a billion dollars. You probably only need to move a billion dollars around occasionally. If I moved seven nuclear-powered aircraft carriers per second anywhere in the universe, I could probably win whatever war I wanted to win if thats what Im using my teleportation power for. So Bitcoin is good for teleporting large chunks of value, but for all of the routine work, you want something smaller. So the logical thing to do is  the way Lightning gets at it is youre putting liquidity in the channel and the channel is at risk, but the overall blockchain isnt. The beauty is you get to keep your keys and keep custody of that. So that a very fascinating thing. You can build the universe on Lightning. Presumably, you could give 8 billion people Lightning wallet or wallets  more than one  you can build Lightning into PayPal and Square Cash and Apple Pay and Google Pay and Facebook and every messaging app, and you could use it at all scale, not just to move money but to move anything. The other day I did a 1,000 satoshi transaction on Lightning for 1 satoshi in 1 second. So Lightning is an obvious layer 2. And the simple design idea is: I create a channel with a million times less Bitcoin in it, and I move it a million times faster. And that works fine. And there are other approaches of course, but you can give up all of the proof of work because you dont have as much at stake. And youre creating a staked network but youre staking it with an external asset that derives its value from assets external to it  energy capital and political capital and technical capital are flowing into Bitcoin capital and Bitcoin capital is flowing into the Lightning Network in order to secure it. So once you get that idea, you realize that a layer 1, layer 2 solution is a lot better idea than a higher performance layer 1 solution. Because making the layer 1 twice as fast or 3x as fast or 10x-100x as fast doesnt get you to a million times as fast. Its no different than the common-sense way that human beings solve every problem: if you had a million dollars in the bank and you were going out on a Saturday and you needed to spend money quickly, you would take $100 in cash and you would break it into 20 $5 bills, you put it in your wallet, and you would rest assured that you cant lose more than $100 and you would leave the rest of the money locked up in the bank. And the money in the bank takes 48 hours to get at and takes lots of degrees of authentication thats behind 3-feet of steel, and the money in your wallet is in your front pocket and it takes 1 second to get at and occasionally you drop a $5 bill on the floor when youre drunk and life goes on. And if somebody said you had to take the entire million dollars with you out to a night club with you every Saturday night you would say, Thats pretty stupid. And if they said, Well you know the bank vault doors theyre too heavy, were just going to have to re-engineer them to make them 1,000x lighter so that you can open the doors faster so that you can access the million dollars on Saturday night while youre drinking  you might think, Well maybe it wasnt such a good idea to actually have access to all my money while I was out drinking on a Saturday night? And the same is true with the idea of a base layer. Maybe its not such a good idea to have that many transactions on the base layer, because every single moving part is just something to break. So youve got yourself too many moving parts  you dont want it. So the layer 2 platform is this idea that what I want to do is I want to just create a cash, if you will, of a much smaller amount of value that is much less at risk that I can afford to move much quicker and I dont need the same degree of security on it. And Lightning is not the only layer 2 platform you can conceive of. Another crypto-network could be a layer 2 platform. In theory you could spin up a proof of stake and you could stake it with Bitcoin and it wouldnt be a theoretically different thing. You can also spin up a crypto-network proof of stake and then you can move Bitcoin through it, but if youre using the native token and moving Bitcoin then your Bitcoin is only as secure as the native token. And of course if the token is ginned out of thin air  Yoyo-coin  then thats a problem. Ultimately the real issue with layer 2s is youre moving a portion of value into that layer 2, trusting the layer 2 in order to get performance or functionality. So you can do it, you can do it with Lightning, and the logical thing you do is you stake with Bitcoin and then you reduce the risk to the channel liquidity. Thats a way to do it and thats logical. Another way to do it is to build some kind of system like maybe if I was an exchange and I had Bitcoin on the exchange and I created an API to the exchange that was programmable. Then in a way the exchange is holding the Bitcoin, the API is providing you with a very fast speed. Now youve taken a different risk. Youve taken exchange risk, which is some counterparty risk of some sort. If you use a Paxos or a NYDIG platform those are more conventional platforms to build applications on top of. Like NYDIG has a platform for you to build a credit card plugged into Bitcoin. And Paxos has a platform plugged into PayPal to their application. So if you want that kind of platform you plug the mobile application into one of those platforms  there is some risk with that counterparty  it is limited to the amount of Bitcoin youre handling on the platform. And you can do all sorts of things to mitigate the risk, but clearly there is a need for layer 2 platforms. And there isnt a need for just one layer 2 platform. Like Lightning is a compelling, decentralized layer 2 platform because its decentralized. But there are a lot of layer 2 platforms that will be centralized because they need to be regulated in order to meet with regulatory compliance obligations. And there are a lot of counterparties, like a credit card company might prefer to work with a centralized layer 2 than a decentralized layer 2 because they have regulatory constraints.", "image": null}

And so in money were saying that the security model of Bitcoin is its decentralization, but with that comes a lot of work. It doesnt do many transactions per second. But what you can do is abstract that Bitcoin to a more centralized database whether its a custodian or a Lightning  a Lightning is kind of a decentralized centralizing force  you pick up all this functionality but youre giving up some of the trust-minimization you get at the base layer.", "image": null}

And performance and functionality and compliance are not on your list. Your list is durability, integrity, immortality. Very simple. But as you move towards applications and you move away from property towards applications, you either have to optimize for functionality  like if there is no functionality there is no application  or you have to optimize for performance. If I cant pay for the coffee within 1 second I cant pay for the coffee. Or you have to optimize for compliance. If I really wanted to issue an insurance policy or I want to issue a security or if I want to issue a yield token, and its illegal in a certain state, then if I want to do it I have to actually comply. And compliance pops up with stablecoins. Compliance pops up with DeFi exchanges. Compliance pops up with derivatives. Compliance with pop up with anything that looks like a security token. These are all applications, but is there a future for those applications on top of Bitcoin? Yeah. But Bitcoin is not the application. The application will be built on a layer 2 platform. Or itll just be built naked against the Bitcoin. Maybe you dont use a platform, like I can implement my Bitcoin credit card using the NYDIG platform, or I could hire an army of programmers and I could build it one-off, right? Theres this little battle of: Do I build a custom app or do I build an app using your SDK? So platforms are going to be operating system-type things with an SDK, and it might be that it looks like an AWS where they spin up services. You could imagine an AWS spinning up a whole package  like a Lightning node  if I could spin up my Lightning nodes and run them maybe I would do that. Maybe I wouldnt do that. Probably Lightning is not the best example because people are looking for something totally decentralized there, but a better example would just be an SDK that allows someone to deploy a mobile app that has Lightning and Bitcoin money transfers embedded in the mobile app and I just want to do it quick and easy.", "image": null}

Massive competition with regard to: what are the SDKs in the layer 2 toolkits? And even Lightning has Lightning Labs developing a toolkit to help you with Lightning. So thats competition, and its interesting but it gets theoretical in a way so its actually probably more instructive to move down to the applications themselves and talk about: what are the applications of Bitcoin that scale the system? Because these are the things that make the different. And once you start to think about the range of applications then you figure out what you might build into your platform if youre trying to create a business hosting those applications. Lets talk about that. The obvious application is the individual HODLer that owns Bitcoin or just HODLs it in cold storage for long periods of time. Its like the family or the individual. I think thats pretty well understood and thats been pioneered for a while. The thing thats varying is the way that that individual chooses to HODL the Bitcoin. And thats where it gets really interesting. For example, one thing that I want to start with is this observation that one interesting application of Bitcoin is a bond. You can actually create a derivative or a security of Bitcoin and scale the network with the bond. So if a government owns Bitcoin, the government is the customer. And if the government then buys the Bitcoin and then issues sovereign debt, the sovereign debt becomes a Bitcoin derivative. So youre creating credit from Bitcoin. Bitcoin is the base layer money, and the debt or the credit or the bond of the government is the layer 2 money. It could be backed in whole by Bitcoin like 100% or it could be backed in part. If a municipality like a city buys Bitcoin and issues municipal bonds that becomes another form of an application of Bitcoin. If an agency like Fanny Mae or Freddie Mac or any international agency  United Nations or the like  if they were to buy Bitcoin and then issue any kind of bonds, its another example of a derivative. When a corporation buys Bitcoin like Microstrategy and then we issue a bond thats backed by the Bitcoin, we created a derivative. And you could even take Bitcoin  theres $700 billion of this Bitcoin out there  and you could issue asset bonds. Call it Bitcoin-backed securities. They used to be called mortgage-backed securities. And with mortgage-backed securities wed take a bunch of heterogeneous assets and wed securitize them into a note, and so imagine you had 21 million identical houses called Bitcoins and you decided that you were going to create a bond backed by 11 or 37 of them  an asset-backed bond. All of those are applications of Bitcoin. Theyre not applications the way a computer scientist thinks of them. Theyre financial applications of Bitcoin. You can have technical applications of Bitcoin that are running on mobile devices like mobile apps, you could have web applications, you could have financial applications of Bitcoin. And a lot of times when people think about scaling, they only think about the technical applications and they dont really think about the financial applications. If we move on the next layer or next type of application, think about mobile payments. A mobile app that does payments is something you can plug into Bitcoin, like Square and PayPal have plugged mobile apps into Bitcoin. What does the app do? Maybe it lets you buy Bicoin, sell Bitcoin, send Bitcoin, send Bitcoin via the Lightning Network like the Muun wallet  thats an application  but maybe it lets you send Bitcoin on its own proprietary network like Square Cash Tags. You can send Bitcoin between one Cash Tag and another Cash Tag instantly for free. You could send Bitcoin between any two mobile apps within the network using the handle of the network. If you were doing that, then probably the application provider custodies some of the Bitcoin and theyre moving it and they become a fractional bank of Bitcoin. Bitcoin becomes the central bank in cyberspace. Our friend Ross Stevens would say the Decentral Bank in cyberspace. All of these other mobile apps or websites become fractional banks plugged into the central bank of cyberspace. And they custody some amount of Bitcoin. The mobile payments space is particularly promising, because all these mobile applications are one step removed from being mobile banks, and theres no reason why Facebook and Apple and Google and the like dont eventually become mobile banks. It was a matter of time before they let you send photos, and then at some point they decided to let you send videos. And then they decided to give you emojis. And then they decided theyd let you send audio files. And in a way you could think of Bitcoin as just another file type.", "image": null}

Now you start with mobile payments and then when you start to think about moving that around and the services that consumers want, youre now into retail banking. The retail banking applications are in essence savings accounts and credit lines based on Bitcoin for consumers. Youve got billions of people that presumably want a wallet with an asset in it, and the asset would be Bitcoin. Then they want to borrow against it. So you want to be able to draw down a credit line at an interest rate. So I carry around $10,000 in Bitcoin, I borrow $1,000, I pay 4% interest. Now Ive drawn the credit line in the local fiat currency in question  Euros, Dollars, Yen  I pay the interest whatever that is, and then I spend the money. Thats pretty popular. I mean credit cards are quite popular, right? How many credit cards are there in the world? So were really talking about credit cards drawn against Bitcoin property instead of unsecured credit lines. The opposite is also the case: maybe the consumers want savings accounts that generate yield. So I have Bitcoin, I either HODL the Bitcoin, or I move the Bitcoin into a yield-generating account, or I move the Bitcoin into a collateral line and I use it and pledge it as credit. Now is that the same everywhere in the world? No not really. Youre going to have different regulators in every jurisdiction. Every state theyre going to tell you whether you need a money transfer license or a banking license or whether or not you need a securities registration in order to give yield or give loans or move money around. Of course, there are always nuances. I think this is one of the nuances that caused El Salvador to designate Bitcoin as legal tender so that they could easily move Bitcoin around in mobile apps. In a place where the government has collapsed, then the solution is going to be a mobile wallet with Lightning because there isnt a regulator. And wherever you have the kind of weak governance then its not going to matter. As the governance gets stronger then there are going to be questions of: whats your compliance requirements to do a retail banking application? It looks like its literally different state to state, country to country, jurisdiction to jurisdiction and evolving right now. Thats one of the reasons why maybe centralized applications  CeFi  will actually beat the DeFi, because the message of DeFi is: Oh its really expensive going through all this KYC. Yes thats true, but its also illegal not to. So the real question will be, Can you do it and how much validation do you have to go through to do it, and how compliant do you want to be.", "image": null}

In all these cases, Bitcoin is becoming more secure, more long-lived, because its co-opting important actors in each of these three areas. We need a network of politicians to defend the network. You need a network of technology providers and semi-conductor providers in order to secure it. We need a network of energy providers to secure it. The fourth area thats fascinating to me is the financial dimension of security of Bitcoin. Because miners are capital-intensive, you need capital to build the mining facilities that require the rigs and to do the engineering. So that capital comes from outside the Bitcoin system. So its US Dollar capital for the most part, or its currency equivalents. Bitcoin miners therefore are recruiting a network of fiat investors. Theres a whole set of conventional investors, they cant buy Bitcoin or they wouldnt buy Bitcoin but they would buy an operating company that mines Bitcoin. Kind of like people that dont want to own gold but they want to own gold mining companies. So this is incredibly stabilizing for the network, because for example today the news was: Fidelity had bought 7% of Marathon. So a big, credible, traditional investor  I think Fidelity has like $2 trillion dollars, trillions of dollars of capital, 20 million customers, and theyve been around foreverthat company is now invested in a Bitcoin miner. How does Bitcoin benefit? Well now youve got hundreds of millions of dollars to lose if the Bitcoin miner fails, and so the investor has a vested interest in protecting their interest. So Bitcoin recruits a whole network of legal, marketing, and political lobbying capability as it recruits investors. There are trillions and trillions of dollars in the conventional economy that for legal reasons or political reasons or business reasons or tax reasons or practical reasons and technical reasons they cant buy Bitcoin, but they can buy a security based on Bitcoin. So in fact from their point of view, they would prefer to buy the publicly-traded company, or if youre a public company investor, you would prefer to buy a publicly-traded company, and if youre a private investor youd prefer to buy the stock of a privately-traded company, and thats just what their pooled capital does. So if you want to co-opt that financial network of investors, you need a capital-intensive use of proceeds. So Bitcoin mining is capital-intensive and proof of work is capital-intensive. If I snap my fingers and I go to say proof of stake and you dont actually need to buy equipment and you dont need to engineer the facility and you dont need to buy the energy, then you dont need the capital. Well then you dont need the investor, then you dont need the investment banker, then you dont need the market they trade in. I guess then you dont need the support of the congressmen, the senators, and the regulators they know, and you probably dont need the media journalists that they talk to. Youre losing all of that, right? And youre also starting to look like youve created your own different system. Youve created a virtual world where the politicians and the media and the capital and the bankers in the other world are irrelevant. You created your imaginary world. And Bitcoin mining bridges the Bitcoin universe  the crypto-asset of Bitcoin  with the physical and the political universe. And if money is socio-economic energy, well theres two elements to that. The energy part says that it needs to be thermo-dynamically sound and conservative and correct. But the socio-economic part says: you need the politicians and you need the media and you need the influencers. So the process by which I construct Bitcoin mining companies is a process of recruiting the support of bankers, investors, politicians, and influencers, as well as technologists and energy producers. And that is a virtuous process. That is actually the hard work. You can think of it as when youre building the Bitcoin mine, thats the foundation upon which youre building the bridge. You ever look at these bridges that cross the Chesapeake Bay they have to dig down and they have to put in place massive pilings in order to build the bridge on top of it. So if the sub-structure and the foundation is weak, then the bridge itself is prone to collapse. The Bitcoin miners themselves, they do all four of these things. And then the fifth layer of security is the network itself. And by the network Im really referring to the Bitcoin mining centers. Every place that Bitcoin miners set up their own mining center, theyre plugging into the energy grid, theyre bringing in the mining rigs, theyre engineering them and suiting them, theyre getting the political support, theyre raising money, and now the miners themselves have their own companies. And theres a lot of public companies and a lot of private companies. Well have like a dozen publicly-traded Bitcoin miners by the end of the year, but lets say theres hundreds of private companies. All of these companies are part of the network of security for Bitcoin. They all have skin in the game. They all have invested human capital, financial capital, technical capital, energy capital, time. As you can imagine, they dont want to lose that, right? They feel pain. And so because they feel pain, they dont want to lose that. They invest to protect that. And so how do you invest to protect $100 million invested in Bitcoin mining? Youre going to contribute to political campaigns, youre going to hire lawyers  you know there are experts in Texas energy law. Youre going to hire lobbyists, youre going to hire marketing people that are going to explain why Bitcoin is good for the world, not bad for the world. Youre going to hire HR people to manage all your HR issues. Youre going to hire financiers to report this to the investors. Youre going to spend a lot of time talking to all these constituencies to make the investors happy, keep the politicians happy. Youre going to be an early warning system against mishap, like if theres a bug in the software of Bitcoin, or if theres a bug in the hardware of Bitcoin, if you dont trust the mining rig manufacturer youre going to push back. If you think that the software is not being fast enough or the hardware is not being upgraded fast enough to keep the network secure and to protect your investment, youre going to lobby and agitate. And youre going to do that in a context where theres a balance of power between you and the node operators, the validators who is a lot, like theres a lot of themand theres also a balance of power with Bitcoin investors. If you try to change the number of Bitcoin or you try to change the block size youll probably have a lot of Bitcoin HODLers thatll push back on you. And then youre going to do it in balance with your fiat investors, the people that hold your securities, or the derivatives. And youre going to be managing the business to try to stay in alignment with regulations in 100 different jurisdictions. And youre going to be communicating all the time. So the Bitcoin mining network is the fifth layer of security of proof of work, and ultimately when you get to a point where you have 50 well-capitalized Bitcoin miners and theyve got billions of dollars each at stake and theyre spread across all the countries in the world, then they are in essence the first line of defense for Bitcoin. You can call them different things  I refer to them as a motor of sovereignty. Theyre running the motor that keeps the sovereign network fresh, and theyre providing the transactions and the security. But you could also look at them as the roundhouses on the wall. They are the first thing youre going to attack, right? When you decide you want to attack Bitcoin youre going to attack the Bitcoin miner. Theyre the first thing to get attacked. Since they have the most at risk, if youre a Bitcoin miner in China, what have you suffered? A lot. They have the most to lose. And so the Bitcoin miner in Switzerland is going to be spending a lot of time thinking about whether theres a political attack coming from Switzerland on Bitcoin. They will be the early warning system, the canaries in the coal mine, if you will. So those five layers, theyre implied by the proof of work algorithm, and we get energy, technology, politics, we get finance and we get network support, and theyre all sources of inertia and antifragility, and they all draw forms of capital that are not Bitcoin. Bitcoin is capital, but dollar capital, semi-conductor capital, political capital, energy capital, human capital  all of these forms of capital are creating a genetic diversity and a Darwinian vitality for the network. If I get rid of all that capital, if I just said, Well Bitcoins going to become a proof of stake network and were just going to stake Bitcoin to run Bitcoin, you see what youve done is created again a hermetically sealed, closed system, but that becomes an inbred system. And that means the biggest Bitcoin HODLer, when they go insane, the securitys not going to get upgraded, right? Were not going to continue to distribute the network, were not going to upgrade the technology anymore, were not going to spend much time complying with the local political rules. And Howard Hughes was the richest man in the world, he ended up retiring into the top floor of his hotel and didnt come out of his room for 7 years, he went bat-shit crazy. You know you can do that when youre the richest man in the world when you dont need anybody else, but you cant do that when you have responsibilities. You have to get up every day and you have to go and put on a suit or a tie or at least conform with the local mores, and that keeps you from going off the deep-end or off the abyss.", "image": null}

We have this digital reality and physical reality thats anchored by energy expenditure, but if you moved to proof of stake youve now severed that bridge. On the network mining specifically theres this dynamic equilibrium of the governance between the miners, nodes, and all these various stakeholders. And the last point that I think is really important and we saw exhibited in this Chinese mining exodus was: the network is very amorphous. If one jurisdiction tries to stamp it down, what happens? A lot of these miners get boxed up, shipped elsewhere, plugged back in.", "image": null}

But its a swarm creature that lives in the physical world and in the political world. It is not a creature in cyberspace. Its not a disembodied astral projection. If you cut the cord, if you dont need energy, if you dont need the semi-conductors, if you dont need the political support, if you dont need external capital, and if you dont need to engineer a facility, if you dont need a corporate structure, then youve created a virtual world like Second Life. And now if I create a virtual world and I design in it a virtual money or a virtual token, and then I stake that virtual token to secure a virtual network so that people can trade virtual goods and virtual things, I can create virtual security but its virtually certain that someones going to create another virtual world, right? The problem is: yeah you outsmarted yourself. You created something which was free and easy, which means that the guy that copied whatever to create Ethereum, well then the guy copied Ethereum to create Cardano and then someone copies Cardano to create the Uniswap and then they make SushiSwap and then they make the next thing. Because you could do it fast and easy. What youve done is youve created a virtual casino or a virtual world and virtual money. And its not that you cant create a business around it. Like Second Life is a business. Fortnite is a business. Online gambling is a business. You can create a virtual casino or a virtual game or a virtual world  Dungeons and Dragons  and you can live in it and you can buy your virtual Vorpal Blade and you can use it to kill the virtual dragon. But the problem is: you dont have a bridge to the thermodynamic real world, nor do you have a political bridge to the political world, and you have lost the space-time constants that give the property integrity, and durabilityand thats a good segue for me to go to layers six and seven. The sixth layer is the spatial layer and the seventh layer is the temporal layer. So by spatial layer I mean the proof of work Bitcoin mining network forces you to spread out throughout the world, because youre not going to find 120 terawatt-hours of energy in one building. And even if you did in one building, the heat engineering is such that you cant stack the Bitcoin miners up over each-other like that. So you have to spread out, and the natural competition means that well we find a volcano here and a nuclear reactor there and we find some stranded gas here. Its an open system and its naturally diffusing and decentralizing, and thats important. If you have a proof of stake network and I have 50% or 20% of all the money, then I can just stake the entire network in Monaco. Why would you need to spread it to the four corners of the Earth? Well the problem with staking the network in Monaco is that maybe Monaco has a political attack, or maybe the building gets wiped out. What if I stake the entire network on like 16 computers in the same place? Youre centralizing it and there is no thermodynamic incentive to decentralize it, and there is no requirement. But in fact with proof of work and the requirement of energy, it naturally is going to create an incentive for someone to put this on a waterfall in the middle of Africa. And that distributes the security load. You dont want all the security to come from Manhattan. If all the security comes from Manhattan thats proof of stake, thats centralized, pretty soon youve got a central bank. Pretty soon three people get together and decide your destiny. Everything just centralizes. You really want to have the security to come from a country that you cant get to, because if you cant get to it, your enemy cant get to it. And ideally it decentralizes so its even hard to distinguish where its coming from. So that spatial layer is forcibly decentralizing it, and its not just decentralizing it geographically, its also decentralizing it politically. And that causes it to decentralize across lots of institutions, lots of political jurisdictions, lots of geographic places. And if you want to attack it, there is no one central place to attack. You cant define the vector. Theres no logical nexus and theres no physical nexus. Like how do I find the top 51%  like 51% of the hashrate is in 198 facilities around the world  how do I take control of all 198 of them overnight without anybody noticing? Because thats crossing 100 borders.", "image": null}

And it even becomes somewhat immune to a protocol attack where someone tries to get people to change the protocol. Its just much harder to attack the durability and the integrity of the network because it becomes so spatially distributed. Proof of stake, 10 people might actually stake 51% so now I can actually identify the 10 people. Now I know who to attack. Psychologically, physically  whatever. I dont even know where to start with something which is spatially distributed. So the seventh layer is temporal distribution. And by that it just means that the attack has to come over time, because it takes 1224 months to create a world-class Bitcoin mining center. It takes another 12 months maybe to order all of the equipment. So how do I go about ordering 7th generation equipment secretly or with malicious intent, and then I have to convince someone to front me the money, right? So I have to hoodwink billions of dollars of investors, then I have to buy billions of dollars of equipment, then I have to wait 12 months, then I have to get someone to engineer the center and I have to get them to agree to do it because they trust me, and theyre not going to do it if they think Im going to attack the network. Then I have to convince the politicians to let me build it  itd take 35 years. Then I have to get all the engineers, then I have to build it, then I have to bring it online so that I can attack the network. And Ive got to do all of that without a single person guessing that Im trying to do it. If one person thinks that I might have malicious intent, theyd leak that on Twitter and 2 million people would know it in 7 minutes. So the space-time functioning of Bitcoin is important. You dont want it to move fast. This is why if you read the Blocksize Wars, a lot of maneuvering back and forth but at the end of the day, the immediate a priori observation is that they shouldnt have tried to change anything. It was a mistake to try to change the blocksize. Its a mistake to try to change the frequency. Why? Because when you create a crypto-universe or a crypto-creature, the block size and the frequency of the network are akin to the space-time constants of the universe. Its like trying to change the gravitational constant and the speed of light. You dont get to play God except once. You can play God once. If Satoshi had designed the network with 1.2mb blocks and 8-minute frequency it might have worked. And theres some parameters that wouldnt have worked. But once he started it and it started to spin then you dont change it, because the size of the blocksize is kind of like the packing density of carbon molecules. Its like, if you were to change the speed of light or the gravitational constant, lets say you changed the gravity on the surface of the Earth. Lets say we made it 3x what it is right now? What happens to every creature, every bridge, every building, every plant, every factory? What happens when I crank up the gravitational constant by a factor of 3?", "image": null}

What happens? Every building and everything built up until now collapses, i.e. all work is negated. Not just work by mankind  work by animals, work by mother nature, rivers, mountains collapse, bridges collapse, companies collapse, countries collapse. So you would negate all past work, you would imperil or impair all structures. You would impair or destroy all machinery constructed. Any machine that works would stop working. And you would throw the future to chaos. And its pretty obvious youre playing God, right? Change the speed of light  the same things going to happen. The Reynolds number determines the hull speed of a ship. Change the Reynolds number, change the way that molecules move around a hydrofoil. Nothing works. Some things sink. At best, everything just gets destroyed, commerce collapses. So when you think about it like that, you come back to the crypto-universe, you say, Okay you created a crypto, you set the space-time parameters. Now the future of mining is based on that blocksize and that frequency. Change the blocksize, change the forecast of the mining revenue, change the expectations of every investor, change every business decision, invalidate all business decisions. At some point the foolishness of doubling the blocksize  which is what the big blockers wanted to do  if they had doubled the blocksize over and over again they would have driven the transaction fees to zero. When transaction fees go to zero the revenue of the Bitcoin mining business is dramatically changed. Now theres no future revenue model. Now you have miners lobbying to change the block reward. You would basically bankrupt the mining business, screw it all up, and then youve got no security network because I cant afford to actually secure the network. So they were imaging a world where everything had to be on the base layer, and theyre monkeying with the base layer. And instead what they should have seen is that the world is in layers. The key is: the base layer of Bitcoin is like the granite underlying Manhattan. You never needed it to be lighter. If somebody said, I have an idea: lets turn the granite in Manhattan into cotton candy! Itll taste better. Its like, Are you an idiot? If you turn all of Manhattan into cotton candy all the buildings are going to sink, were all going to die in a cotton candy swamp. You know its so silly like were laughing, but the point isBut the granites heavy and its hard for me to move and its slow and the transaction fees for moving granite around are high  Yes! Youre not supposed to move the granite! Youre supposed to build on top of the granite. And the same is true with the base layer. Youre not supposed to move the base layer. The point of the base layer is to be here 1,000 years from now, right? Yeah you can wave your arm and convert the granite into sand or into mud and you can move it. You can shovel it out of the way with your little toy shovel from the seashore from when you were a kid, but the point is: you cant build a city thats going to last 1,000 years on mud and on sand. And if you have an understanding of the universe, the universe is layers and layers, and the consequences of the speed of sound is everything that flies through the air. And the consequences of the speed of light is everything in the universe. And the consequence of the gravitational constant is how the water flows and how the mountains move. And once you understand those things you can build everything. Everything that humanity has done in the history of the human race is predicated on those space-time constants being what they were. And when you decide to routinely change them youre playing God. And when you play God you pretty much destroy everything that came before and throw into chaos everything that comes afterwards after leveling every building and leaving a trail of wreckage in the present day. Its like an earthquake except its worse than an earthquake. Its like a continual rolling, randomized series of different earthquakes every second. And thats why you dont want to screw with that.", "image": null}

The transaction fees are too high, lets take them to zero. Well thats the same as saying, Lets get rid of friction. And lets get rid of gravity. Well getting rid of friction and gravity is a problem because pretty much everything weve created works with it. How about your tires without friction? How well is your car going to drive without friction? Theyre not bad things. In the defense of the big blockers, the Lightning Network was not as manifestly clear today, but all you have to do is look at a Lightning wallet and a Lightning transaction and look at a layer 2 and a layer 3 transaction  look at how Square Cash App works, look at how Muun works  I can send 1,000 sats in 1 second for 1 sat. Once you see that you realize layer 2 platforms, layer 3 applications are going to move Bitcoin at the speed of light in an almost friction-free way, and what did you really want from Bitcoin? You wanted it to not break. Its foolish to risk the immortality of Bitcoin in order to go from 1mb to 2mb blocks. Its foolish. How about  you could have had something that would be immortal and you could build a civilization that would last for 10,000 years and you could just do it with layer 2 and layer 3 apps, but instead were risking putting out the fire of civilization to try to change the space-time coefficients of the one crypto-network which successfully took root and decentralized.", "image": null}

Look, proof of work is an open, competitive, natural system. It emulates Darwinian competition. And its open. Proof of stake is a closed, controlled system. So the problem with a closed, controlled system is its not Darwinian and theres no genetic diversity. It becomes inbred. So lets take a shoreline  a living shoreline. If youre trying to actually maintain such a thing. The way they engineer it is, you would create 200-foot long revetments and you would put a break in it for the seawater to come in, and then you create another revetment to protect the shore from the surf, but you always have to have a break for seawater to come in. If you dont leave that channel for seawater to come in, then the water behind the revetment becomes putrid. You ever seen a putrid standing body of water without circulation? It breeds bacteria, it becomes infested, it becomes dangerous, its not healthy. And why? Its closed. Its a closed system. All cities, all civilizations  why do you build a city on a river? Because you need something to carry the waste away. What happens if you recirculate your waste in your own [inaudible 38:19]? How long can you recirculate the waste in your space suit? How long can you recirculate the water and the waste in your apartment? Well proof of stake is recirculating itself and the problem there is, unless you have perfect components and you have perfect conditions, at some point either the toxicity of the closed environment destroys the ecosystem, or it becomes so fragile because of the lack of Darwinian competition and the lack of ecological genetic diversity that eventually it dies. Its like a creature endlessly cloning itself. After you endlessly clone yourself youre subject to genetic mutations and defects. Thats why every organic creature has sex, right? You actually want to keep mixing the DNA in order to avoid the mutated defects. And you cant cleanse yourself. You cant fix the species if you close the system.", "image": null}

And coming back to the other elephant in the room here: Bitcoin is a successful proof of work network that has created our first digital money, our first digital property. Bitcoin has done that. We can see that. There are no successful examples of a proof of stake network succeeding as digital property. Thats the elephant in the room. There are no successful proof of stake networks. What would be required to be successful? Well heres a simple one: if the United States government designated a proof of stake network as property and not a security. Its never happened. In fact the head of the SEC just went on television and said, If theres an ICO and theres a shared enterprise with intent to profit then its a security. So as far as I can see every proof of stake network thats been launched looks to be by legal definition a security, not property. And even Ethereum isnt a proof of stake network, so theres a debate about whether it is property or not, and thatll eventually be resolved. But theres absolutely no question that at this point the only successful digital property thats ever been created in the history of the world was created on a proof of work network. Theres nothing else. Everything else is just like a garage-science experiment or a venture experiment. And on the surface they all appear to be securities. I mean none of them has successfully decentralized or been embraced as property. And its not clear whether they can successfully decentralize. I mean, theoretically new things are possible, but practically speaking we have one example of crypto-property or crypto-money, and that is Bitcoin.

Ive called it the seven layers of security, but I think we should start with a fundamental observation: what were trying to create with Bitcoin is a digital property network. Something that will last for 1,000 years or 10,000 years. How do I create digital property in cyberspace? And we can call it money if we like  digital monetary network or digital property network. But what I want is I want a decentralized network that will last past the average life expectancy of a human being, or an institution, or a nation-state. So how do I do that? Well the beauty of proof of work is that the network derives its integrity from the interplay of the miners and the nodes and the HODLers, or the wallets if you will. With an especial emphasis on the miners. What do I define a security? Well property needs to be optimized for integrity and durability over time, integrity meaning the protocol cant be corrupted. It cant mutate. If the protocol mutates we go from 21 million to 48 million, you get a monstrosity. So you dont want a mutation. And then I dont want it to die. So if I said I want to design an immortal creature, something that will live for a million years, and I want it to maintain its integrity, then Ive got to protect the protocol, and then Ive also got to feed it energy and resources continually, and I have to protect it from a hostile attack in the near-term. Sometimes we think about security we think just about avoiding an attack, but really security is: you cant [be attacked] in the near-term, we dont want it to die, and most importantly, if you live but you go insane or you get a grotesque mutation, then did you really live? So how am I going to achieve my quest for immortality in a network? And the beauty of proof of work is it is an open protocol that is Darwinian and competitive in a way such that it is not just self-correcting on the protocol level to ensure correct money, but its also self-healing and its adaptive to the environment around it. I like to call these the seven layers of security, so what do you have? You have: an energy layer, a technology layer, a political layer, a financial layer, a network layer, a spatial layer, and a temporal layer of energy. Those seven various dimensions. So Ill start with the first dimension of security: energy. I have a hashrate  say weve got 100 exahash right now. Well Ive got to feed it energy in order to create the 100 exahash. Bitcoin is a big customer of energy. In fact it turns out that Bitcoin is the most valuable, most compelling industrial customer of energy in the world right now. You can generate about 40 cents per kilowatt-hour in revenue mining Bitcoin. So that makes it interesting because that co-opts all the energy industry. So one way that Bitcoin spreads and stays organically vital is it forms partnerships with the energy industry. If you have a volcano in the middle of Central America, the value of that energy sold within 500 miles of you is like 1 penny a kilowatt-hour. Unless you sell it to Bitcoin, and its 40 cents a kilowatt-hour. So Bitcoin is the best customer for your volcano. Bitcoin is a customer of stranded energy, intermittent energy, energy on any frequency, and energy at any scale. And you dont need to be co-located with an industrial customer or a consumer. And you dont need bandwidth. So for example, Whats the second-best use of energy? Maybe like running Netflix or Google data centers? But if you want to run a Google data center, you need to be within a fiber-optic distance of the major switching networks because youre streaming video and streaming a lot of high-bandwidth queries. So theyre bandwidth-intensive, and they need to be triple-redundant because they cant fail. If youre trying to operate a car with Google Maps, you cant afford to have an outage in the network. So Bitcoin miners are so much better than a typical data center because you could monetize the entire volcano or you could monetize the entire waterfall or the entire nuclear reactor  the full bandwidth of it. You could do it at the North Pole. You could do it with a satellite up-link. And you could monetize intermittent energy coming off of wind or wave or solar. And you can also shut it down in a heartbeat with fairly low economic cost. So that makes Bitcoin the most compelling technology for the energy industry thats come along this decade  maybe in a long time. The last big energy technology was aluminum, when people would use their excess energy to smelt aluminum. Well Bitcoin re-built that but in spades. To do Bitcoin you dont need a port to ship aluminum in and out of. You dont need an aluminum factory which is difficult. You dont need aluminum ore. And you also dont need the industrial demand for aluminum, which eventually saturates. Aluminum is a specialty metal. So what is Bitcoin? Bitcoin is money! So half of everything that the human race is Bitcoin, or will be Bitcoin in time. So Bitcoin mining is securing and producing something which is of enormous value on a very thin line based upon any flavor and frequency of energy, and theres really nothing like that. Why does that make the network secure? Well Bitcoin miners are continually looking for new energy sources and theyre negotiating for cheap energy, and when they buy it they become a big customer. So as they become customers of energy producers everywhere in the world, the energy producers become political allies of Bitcoin. So the energy producers are all regulated entities, but theyre all very credible, and theyre all wired into the political fabric of every society. So if you are the best customer of the utility in the city or the state or the country, then that utility has the vested interest in protecting your interest. So Bitcoin co-opts energy companies, and also Bitcoin is hope for a utility. If you are a value stock 100-year old utility company, youre not getting a high multiple in the stock market, theres not a lot of excitement. In fact youre regulated and there are limits on how much money you can make by selling your energy to consumers or to businesses. If the power company in New York City just jacked the price of energy by a factor of three they would get shut down by the regulators. On the other hand, if you get into the Bitcoin mining business, you dont have those kind of regulations on you. So Bitcoin is a chance for energy companies to become technology companies, and it solves so many of their problems. I can generate more revenuecheck. I can generate revenue at much higher price per kilowatt-hour  its a very high price customer. The value and use of electricity for Bitcoin miners is higher than any other customer they have, so thats good  check. Its portable. And so that means every place Ive got stranded energy production facilities I can move the Bitcoin mine to the energy  check, thats interesting. Its an energy shock-absorber. If I have a renewable energy network say with wind and solar, what I want to do is I want to build it to the level of peak demand, but if I build at the level of peak demand I will over-build it by a factor of two or more, and that means Ill be running at 50% utilization for my consumer and other industrial customers. So how am I going to find a customer thats willing to actually take up half of my energy production and then turn off for 10, 20 hours a year when theres a brown-out without complaining? Like, the hospitals not going to do that. Homes arent going to do that. So I need some kind of industrial producer that becomes a shock-absorber  theyre going to drive up my utilization to 98% and then when I brown out theyre going to turn off and give back energy to the network. So Bitcoin represents a driver for the development of sustainable and renewable energy, it also represents a technology to provide more reliability and fault-tolerance to a power grid. If you think about the role of capacitors or batteries or shock-absorbers in electrical or mechanical machines, thats what Bitcoin is for a power network.", "image": null}

So youve described money as energy, socio-political energy. So in that framework I guess we could consider banks historically where they were actually providing custody of gold, they were kind of like energy stores in a way  were storing this excess productive economic energy in gold that banks were custodying for us. And now with Bitcoin we have this more direct path to monetizing energy, and so an interesting thing here  youve heard about a power bank, these little devices that will charge your phone that stores energy. So its like banks and power banks  do you see the energy producers and banks somehow converging? Because it seems like on a Bitcoin standard you eliminate the need for a custodial bank, they become kind of synonymous with energy producers. Do you see those industries coming together in the future?", "image": null}

Its encrypting the energy from electrical energy into monetary energy. And so on one hand its upgrading the raw physical energy through the encryption process, and then on the other hand its digitally transforming analog fiat energy into encrypted money  digital money. And that makes Bitcoin a bank, an energy bank, a monetary bank. It makes it the worlds greatest battery, right? You could look at it from two angles: banks are bleeding off 1% of your energy a month due to inflation. Batteries are bleeding off 1% of your electrical energy a month just due to battery engineering. Youve got two inefficient energy systems: batteries and power grids dont work that well, and fiat banks and monetary grids dont work that well. And Bitcoin plus Lightning gives you a battery to store all the worlds energy forever without power loss. The other day I sent 1,000 sats on the Lightning Network in 1 second for 1 sat. So literally youve got speed of light, nearly  you know, what is the cost of 1 sat, its such an infinitesimally small number, a fraction of a fraction of a penny  so Bitcoins a very efficient energy system. I think that the significance here is that Bitcoin is disruptive technology for the entire energy market, and its co-opting the energy producers and energy investors into Bitcoin. What you see right now is you see a lot of traditional power companies that used to be in the energy business, theyre getting into Bitcoin mining. People with natural gas, people in the nuclear industry, people in the wind and solar industry  theyre getting into Bitcoin mining or theyre partnering with Bitcoin mines. So Bitcoin recruited energy capital, and Bitcoin secures the network with energy capital. Hundreds and hundreds of producers of energy are plugged into the Bitcoin network creating that hash wall. So thats the first layer of security for Bitcoin. And if youre going to attack it, its no small feat to go and collect that much energy. You almost cant. Youre not going to collect twice as much energy, or as much energy as is currently in the Bitcoin mining network. Politically, economically, practically, I just dont know how youd do it, right? Very, very problematic. And theres no short-cut. In that regard, theres an energy wall and you have to jump over it. And its a lot, to the point where youre talking about 100 terawatt-hours of energy or something. Its a lot of energy. So the second layer though is technology. And this I dont think people really understand that well and when I talk about technology Im referring to Bitcoin ASIC miners. Bitcoin is a wall of encrypted energy, so the energy is the first part, but the encrypting, the encryption, the crypto is the second part  the crypto-wall of energy. Its not raw energy. If it was raw energy you just need 100 terawatt-hours to start to get parity. But when its encrypted energy, I need 100 exahash of SHA-256 mining equipment, and since its like 10,000 miners to get to an exahash right now, then thats a million mining rigs of the latest build  how do you come up with a million mining rigs? Its like, no ones got a million mining rigs sitting around. Its not clear how long it would take to manufacture a million mining rigs. Bitcoins co-opting technology companies. So Bitmain is a big player, but there are other big players too, and as Bitcoin gets larger, I think youll see the Intels of the world and youll see other semi-conductor companies designing Bitcoin mining rigs and getting into the space. And this is another example where this is open and competitive. Who wants it the most? Whoever wants it  and what capital do you need? This is semi-conductor fabrication capital. You have to fabricate these ASICs. The S19 family is five times more efficient than the S9s. So if you wanted to generate an exahash on the S9 family, it took 150 megawatts of power  thats a lot of power. If you wanted to do it with S19s its 30 megawatts of power. A 5x difference in a generation. If you get through two generations every 10 years  or three, right?  youre talking about a 20x improvement. I mean were 100x more technically efficient today than we were 8 years ago. Where will we be in 10 more years? We go back and forth  theres all sorts of people with opinions. Theres Moores Law, some people think that ASIC technology efficiency will slow down, but then again people have been predicting that we would hit a wall in Moores Law for a while and theyre still not quite right. So when you understand the Bitcoin network, what you can think is that the Bitcoin mining network 10 years ago was very energy-intensive and technology-poor. There was a time when you were just using off-the-shelf chips, and then you were using GPUs, and then you were using ASIC first generation, and then ASIC next generation. So were like five generations into this now. In the early time-frame, you threw probably 1,000x if not a million times as much energy to generate a hash. And now youre throwing 30 megawatts to generate an exahash. But when we get to the next generation itll be 5 megawatts. Well what if we get to 1 megawatt? So as you go out, energy is still important, but it turns out that the network is rotating from energy-intensive security to technology-intensive security. What if you imagine one day there will be 10 million mining rigs but theyll be seventh-generation ASICs and they will be a hundred times more efficient than anything we have today? What that means is that 99% of the hashpower will come from that generation of mining rigs, which means that all this stuff that we have today becomes 1% of the network, right? Which means it gets squeezed out of the ecosystem. All those miners that are obsolete go out of business. And so that technology intensity has a couple of dynamics: 1) thats what keeps the network from consuming all the energy in the world. I mean, people say silly things like, Oh well the energy usage is going to increase with the price. Well no its not. The energy usage maybe will increase with the log of the price. That is, if the price goes up by a factor of 10, energy usage might go up by a factor of 2. And if price goes up by a factor of 100, energy usage might go up by a factor or 3 or 4. But what youve got is a situation where the halvings are cutting the block reward in half every 4 years, so thats a built-in 5x improvement in efficiency every decade, and then if you crank over that another 10x improvement in hardware, youre talking about a 50x improvement in tech efficiency in a decade, or a 50x50x in 20 years. So the price has got to go way up, and even so, what youve got is a rotation: the network is rotating from, I burn a lot of energy to generate my hashes to, I burn less energy, to I burn less energy to generate more hashes. Its not hard to see this, right? Its in your iPhone: your iPhone has more processing power than the space shuttle had 40 years ago. Youve got a supercomputer in your pocket, so youve got to assume that the security chips that generate the hashes just keep getting better. And because Bitcoin is unique in the protocol, all of the other processing power is irrelevant, right? Bitcoin is a Darwinian competition to generate the SHA-256 hashes. And its 95% dominant in that game right now. Theres a few other crypto-networks that use that but theyre like 12%. So that uniqueness with regard to the proof of work protocol protects it from an attack from all of the AWS network or all of the Google network or if everybody turned their iPhones to Bitcoin mining it wouldnt help them that much, right?", "image": null}

Well actually the miners are spending money on energy, and then theyre spending money on semi-conductor mining rigs, and then theyre spending money on the mining centers themselves.

People are running old, inefficient miners in China on free power, and then in the US and North America publicly-traded companies are buying the latest-generation expensive miners because their power is more expensive but they have more capital. If I have $500 million in capital, spend $60 million to buy 10,000 S19s, mine 1 exahash on 30 megawatts and make $120 million a year. Good deal? Probably a good deal, right? So in that case you would rather buy the better equipment. I think you find at any given time theres like three generations of mining equipment. When the price goes high, if you look at the hashrate of the network back in the first quarter, there was a point when the hashrate got to like 190 or something, and I thought the peak was 170 but there was a surge up by about 1015 exahash and I posit that that surge was because people turned on third-generation mining equipment, like the oldest, least-efficient stuff. And theres a relationship: an S19 is generating 40 cents a kilowatt-hour right now. Ergo, it is profitable to buy electricity up to 39 cents a kilowatt-hour. An S9 was 5x more inefficient, so S9s were profitable at 8 cents a kilowatt-hour. But if you go back one generation before that, if youre 5x less efficient than that youre profitable at 1.5 cents a kilowatt-hour. So the break-even point is a function of the semi-conductor, or the joules per terahash. And thats a technology driver, its not an energy driver. And most of the people that model Bitcoin mining, they dont really focus upon the technical efficiency of the miners. And by miner I dont just mean the one mining rig, I just mean the mining operator that has a mixture of first generation, second generation, third generation equipment. And you may turn off  like if the price of Bitcoin went to $5,000 a coin right now, people would probably turn off the old mining equipment unless the energy was free, right? You can bootleg Bitcoin on free energy if youre stealing the energy. But if the energy costs 3 cents a kilowatt-hour youre going to turn off your old equipment, youre going to keep the new equipment running. And thats an adaptive correcting system itself. When the price goes up youre going to turn on the old equipment. And over time though, these are transient phenomena because the more important phenomena to focus on is that over a decade, the technical efficiency of the mining network is going to increase by a factor of 20x100x depending upon the rate at which people upgrade the semi-conductors. There are a lot of ways that you can enter into the network and you can disrupt the equilibrium. One way as a nation-state is you can start mining off of a volcano. The other way you can design a totally new family of ASICs. Maybe Intel or Apple wants to get in the space  they could disrupt it. A big energy producer could disrupt it. Right now the limiting factor is the number of mining rigs you can get your hands on  thats good. That creates some predictability to it. And that keeps us from going chaotic. So if you look at these two layers of security, the energy layer is co-opting energy providers all around the world, and the technology dimension is co-opting semi-conducting manufacturers. And if one of them like Bitmain gets too much power, you know Jeff Bezoss famous line, Your margin is my opportunity. So if one company gets too much power then well this is not that terribly complicated engineering. Its well-understood how to design SHA-256 ASICs.", "image": null}

And there are a lot of companies like Qualcomm, Intel, when they get squeezed they need a new market  this is the new market for them as the price goes up. And the interesting thing of course is: if theres only one provider of SHA-256 miners  Bitmain  doesnt that create an artificial scarcity to hashrate? And if there is a scarcity to hashrate, the profitability of Bitcoin miners goes up, right? And so if the profitability of Bitcoin miners goes up, then dont more people want to get into the business? And if more people want to get into the business, dont they need to buy Bitcoin mining rigs? And if they need to buy it and theres infinite money, dont they go and find someone else to go break that monopoly? So energy and technology are a key part of the equation. But theyre not the only part of the equation, because if I want to generate hashes I have to set up a Bitcoin mining facility. Theres physical nexus  I have to do it in Iceland or El Salvador or Canada or Texas. And you could probably run your stake validator on a secret machine in your basement, but you cant run a 150 megawatt facility  youd need the support of the mayor, the county, the governor. You could look at this as a negative  it isnt, its a positive. What it means is that Bitcoin miners are knocking on doors everywhere in the universe and theyre looking for supportive political jurisdictions. If New York City doesnt want to mine Bitcoin, maybe Texas does. Maybe Florida does. Maybe Wyoming does, right? And so if China doesnt, well then maybe Kazakhstan does. In fact, the more irrational one country is, the more appealing Bitcoin mining is to the others. When China actually cracked down on Bitcoin mining, the revenues of Bitcoin miners doubled. The profits quadrupled. And the incentive to get in the mining business jumped. So what you have is an interesting dynamic where Bitcoin miners partner with energy companies, and they partner with technology companies, but they also partner with political jurisdictions and politicians. And this is an interesting situation too because this is so Darwinian: what happens if youre a Bitcoin miner and you set up a billion dollar Bitcoin mining rig in New York York and theres a new mayor and he outlaws Bitcoin mining? What happens to your capital? You cant move it, right? So Bitcoin miners have skin in the game. And because they have skin in the game, that means that they have to do their due diligence and theyve got a long time-horizon. A person thats mining Bitcoin is looking out 5 years, looking out 10 years. You kind of want to be in a jurisdiction where you think that a decade from now youll still be able to mine Bitcoin, and so it forces you to be more thoughtful. And the next step is, Well I just invest hundreds of millions of dollars in this county, I guess I probably better contribute to the county election and get the mayor elected, right? You put down roots, because you have a vested interest. Because you have something to lose. So the Bitcoin mining network actually becomes a politically lobbying network for Bitcoin. And then every politician that has a Bitcoin mine has tax revenue. You know, when New York wanted to ban Bitcoin mining, that was blocked by a politician because the politician got a letter from the union, and the union said, Were going to lose jobs. So all the money that flows into creating mining centers creates jobs, creates tax revenue, supports politicians, creates massive revenues for engineering companies, for real estate companies, for landlords, etc. Its good for the local economy. Bitcoin brings prosperity anywhere on Earth. You might be a limousine liberal in the upper-east side and not like the use of electricity. On the other hand, but if youre living in the middle of central Africa and if you have a volcano or if you have a waterfall and 90% of your population is living below the poverty level and there is no industry and someone shows up and offers to give you billions of dollars if they can attach a turbine to your waterfall  how do you feel about the situation?", "image": null}

Google is not going to show up in Zambia central Africa and offer them $300 million a year to run a Google data center. Its not going to happen. So what you have is Bitcoin is hope for energy, it is hope for your semi-conductor company, it is hope for your political jurisdiction, it solves a problem, and because it can go anywhere on Earth with a satellite uplink, its probably a more compelling solution to someone that has natural resources in a poor country even than in a wealthy country. And what you end up with is a self-distributing dynamically distributing Bitcoin mining network, and it has solved for the problem, Where do I find the cheapest energy in a politically supportive jurisdiction? Thats the problem youre solving for them. Thats not the same as the cheapest energy. It has to be cheap energy from an energy provider you trust, in a political jurisdiction you trust. Okay well whats the answer? The answer is that its a dynamic equilibrium. Its changing every single week. It was different 3 years ago. 3 years ago there was free electricity in provinces that had empty excess coal electricity capacity in China, and so you could get effectively free energy. Okay, it was free but it wasnt politically stable. Now you can go to a politically-stable place like Texas and get it for 3 cents. Or maybe you can get it for 1 penny in Kazakhstan, or maybe you can go some other random place. You could go to Cuba or you can get a bootleg thing in the jungle from some warlord. For how long? Well the Bitcoin mining network is continually distributing itself, and its organic. Its just like asking the question, When we settle around the Earth, where should we settle where well be able to make a living and we wont suffer from famine or a tornado? And the answer is: you dont know! Until youve lived 100 years you dont know that place floods. Whats the likelihood of an earthquake in your favorite place? Well youll find out. So what happens? Well the network distributes itself, some people make good choices, some people make unwise choices. This goes back to antifragile or the like. You make really awful choices youll probably be put out of business within 36 months. If you make okay choices you might last 310 years. And then maybe there are other choices where youll be good for 100 years. But maybe youre better off to go to the place where youre good for 6 years where the energy is 1 penny instead of the place where youre good for 100 years where the energy is 5 pennies. And maybe we could debate it. And maybe you have an opinion and we could argue until the cows come home, but what does it matter? Its better to just release the entire creature, let the entire world work in a Darwinian, Adam Smith evolutionary fashion, a competitive way, and the lesson of the markets is that the market is smarter than anybody. Every time I think about what I knew, half the time I thought I knew it and I was wrong and sometimes I was right, but the market generally outsmarts the smartest person. So Bitcoin mining is a dynamic market in security and its balancing energy versus technology versus political support. And that takes us to the fourth layer of security ", "image": null}

Its a shock-absorber. It is stabilizing. Its a political shock-absorber and its an energy shock absorber. If you have a political regime and youve got natural resources but your economy is tanked, Bitcoin comes in  on one hand the Bitcoin miner can generate $500 million a year in revenueOkay. On the other hand the Bitcoin miner can say were not coming unless we actually feel this is a stable regime to operate in. You know how theres that phrase, I got married and my wife made me want to be a better man. Its like, Okay well if you get married you have to give up some of your bachelor ways, right? And if you have a child you have to be even more responsible. So the commitment to a family is stabilizing, because youre thinking, I cant do the crazy things I did when I had no other responsibilities. If you dont actually have any industry you have nothing to lose. And so a country that has a Bitcoin mine has something to gain and something to lose, and if you were to actually seize the Bitcoin mine, no other Bitcoin miners are coming to you, right? Its the same as seizing the Bitcoin. If you make Bitcoin illegal in your country and you make mining illegal then you lose all that. But if you make Bitcoin legal or welcome and you make mining welcome you gain something. And then if youre rational you might remember that your prosperity came from the new job you had, and then that way you dont want to lose the job. If youre jobless and homeless, well first of all theres nothing to lose, and then if someone puts a $37 revolver in front of you maybe thats more appealing to you to use that. If I had nothing I might be more prone to violence. And then why do people resort to violence? Maybe because its hopeless? If I feel like things are hopeless I either kill myself or I kill somebody else. Bitcoin is hope, and so yeah it is politically stabilizing, because its a way out for someone that cant find another way out, and once you adopt Bitcoin you see something that worked, and you have something to lose, and youre part of the multi-national Bitcoin network and that is civilizing in its own special way.

So I think a good place to start is exploring the way that we did everything in the 20th century with the fiat system and then comparing the implications when you switch to the Bitcoin system. In essence, Whats the difference between an analog monetary system and a digital monetary system? And I find it helpful to try to model the two. So if someone said to me, What is Bitcoin doing? Well Bitcoin is dematerializing the accountants, the auditors, the compliance function, the information technology function, the human resources function, the security function, the facilities function, the police force, the military, the function of war, and the function of politics  all of those things are dematerializing and theyre collapsing into the Bitcoin network. And so on one side, the 20th century  if you want to operate a business like Im a publicly traded business, I need accountants. And every three months we close our books. Every three months. The gold standard of business operations is you close your books quarterly and you have finance people and accountants that do the book close. And Ive been a public company officer for like 22 years so Ive done 88 quarterly closes  actually more than that. Well Bitcoin closes the books every 10 minutes, right? So youve got an accounting function but instead of a quarterly close you have a 10-minute close. So then you have this other issue which is that in my world  the public company world  after you close the books you have auditors. So the auditors look at the books to verify that theyve been properly closed and they sign off on your quarterly results and then theres a 10-K where they sign off on the books at the end of the year. The audit process is manual and expensive in the fiat world. In the Bitcoin world youve kind of got triple-entry bookkeeping  not double-entry but triple-entry  because the books get burned cryptographically and theyre truly closed. Theyre closed with an encryption whereas the books of a public company theyre kind of open and then they sort of closed, with a private company they never quite close  you can never be quite sure. And youve got manual accountants and manual auditors. And so those two functions matter a lot, but then the third function, if you look at the conventional bank or any kind of fiat bank, youve got a compliance function. And the compliance function is to make sure that you didnt enter in any kind of transactions which are illegal or non-compliant or not permissible. You cant enter into any inappropriate transaction. That compliance sometimes comes after the transactions are entered into. You see with like Archegos where you had UBS write off billions and billions of dollars. Well they entered into some non-compliant transactions where they took risks they shouldnt take, and they found out after the fact and the cost was billions of dollars to their shareholders. Well Bitcoin solves that compliance issue with the nodes that are verifying transactions are compliant and youve got like six verifications before youre sure its compliant. On the first verification its sort of compliant. But the assurance of the compliance comes from from the mining plus the nodes themselves, and its 100%  what is it 99.999999% certain after like the sixth confirmation  so youve got an automated process which is distributed which is almost incorruptible. Whereas compliance in the fiat banking world is a manual processand youre not even checking compliance of every transaction, right? In Bitcoin youve got 100% compliance by the time youve got six verifications down, which is 60-minutes. Well you could be 6 months after closing a quarter in a publicly traded company or at a bank  think about your credit card company. Youre Mastercard or youre Visa and youre doing all of these transactions  what percentage of them are 100% compliant, and when? In fact you could be six months after the quarter closes and you would still have lots and lots of non-compliant transactions they passed through the system. And thats fraud, and the economy pays the price on that. You go to the next level  IT  a bank or a money transfer agent in the fiat world has a big IT department and a bunch of data centers. Whereas in the Bitcoin world the miners and the nodes  that is the IT infrastructure. So its completely decentralized and self-maintaining and self-healing. And its continually upgrading itself through the process of mining. Whereas the banks, they have to have an IT department and an IT budget and they have to continually invest in this or they become obsolete. So the fiat bank also has a human resources department. You have to hire people to order the equipment, to configure the equipment, to upgrade the equipment, to do the compliance, to do the accounting, to do the transactions. Well Bitcoin doesnt have a human resources department, because there are no employees. Youve kind of dematerialized it. Why is that interesting? If theres no human resources department theres nobody to quit, right? Theres no one to fire, theres no one to complain, theres no one to harass, because there isnt a human resources department at all. So you can see we have taken all of these human factors and we have dematerialized them into the protocol and the decentralized hardware which is continually being upgraded  unless it isnt! And if it isnt upgraded  if youre running a node and you dont upgrade you fall out of consensus and you just get sloughed off the network. And if youre a miner and youre running on four-generation old mining equipment then you become 100x more inefficient and then you cant mine any more Bitcoin and you get pushed off the network. And if youre running a miner and you dont pay your electricity bill you get pushed off the network. So the network is self-healing, self-sealing, self-upgrading in the Bitcoin world. Whereas in the fiat banking world it requires human intervention to do all these things. So  complicated, were doing it  whats the next step? Well, security. In a real bank Ive got to have security professionals. Ive got all sorts of IT security, physical security, people with guns, people hiring and training the people with guns, etc., and Ive got to worry about someone hacking into that security system. As long as theres someone responsible then you have to worry about that person. But in Bitcoin the security is intrinsic to the network, its basically built into the protocol. Its making itself more secure. And then we get to facilities. The fiat bank has to go and have a facility in the middle of New York City and theyve got a landlord and theyve got a lease and theyre paying money and theyre paying taxes on the facility. The facility in Bitcoin in essence becomes the mining rigs wherever they might be, or the nodes. And so youve got a much simpler facilities model. In order to make fiat banking work you have to have a police force, because the next layer is physical or civil security and thats provided by a police force. If you have a billion dollars in New York City or a bank with a billion dollars, then you need a police force in New York City to keep you from getting mugged. But if you have a billion dollars in Bitcoin and youre in New York City, you dont rely upon the police force, nor does anybody know you have it. But if they did have it, the security for New York City comes from a Bitcoin miner in Iceland. And so security is not co-located with the asset in the Bitcoin system. In fact, security doesnt scale or it doesnt increase with the number of nodes of asset or the velocity of the asset in the Bitcoin system. In the fiat system security becomes a big problem, because maybe you have a billion dollars and you feel safe in New York, but when you go to Brazil, you dont. Or you go to _______, whichever place it is that you dont feel secure in, at some point youre required to rely upon the police protection as you cross jurisdictions. And that makes security heterogeneous and manual and expensive. And with Bitcoin you have the same security on a cruise ship in the mid-Atlantic as you have in a vault in the basement of J.P. Morgan in Manhattan as you have on an airplane. And even if youre sitting on a sailing boat in the Caribbean and three people have guns to your head, youve still got the Bitcoin miner in Iceland securing your asset and its a negotiation. The Bitcoin is quite secure! Its more secure than you are. You have a physical security issue, but your financial security is the highest degree that anybody in the human race has ever had before", "image": null}

Where especially if youve properly custodied it, even if youve got the three guns to your head in the middle of the Atlantic, if its in a multisig done properly youre not going to lose custody of that asset. And even if they take you out in theory you have an inheritance or a succession model behind that such that the asset rolls on to your heirs or wherever you determine  you cant really do that with anything else, at least in a bearer asset form. You always end up trusting some intermediary to carry out your will, so thats something that makes Bitcoin very unique.", "image": null}

It really is the only thing that you can take with you to the grave. And I joked about it. I was online going back and forth with Peter Schiff the other day. He was saying, Why would anybody ever want something for 100 years, youll all be dead by then? And I said, Well you can take it with you to the grave, and hes like, Well you can take gold to the grave. And I posted an article on ancient Egyptian burial tombs, and if you go back and you do even just a few seconds of history and do a few minutes of research, you know that for the last 5,000 years people have been trying to figure out how to bury gold with them  theyve all failed. 2,500 years ago the Egyptians created pyramids and hidden tombs. They still had the tomb robbers  people would break into the pyramids. The only reason that King Tut had a treasure that lasted into the 20th century was because it was buried by a sandstorm and people didnt know his tomb existed. It was lost. But every other protected tomb with a treasure in it was raided and looted. And if you pause and think about it a bit, and if youre really serious and thoughtful, what you realize is: there is no form of property that you can have custody of while youre alive and after youre dead, and theres no form of property that respects your wishes after youre dead, other than Bitcoin. And the significance of that is not you need the money after youre dead  thats not the point. The point is much deeper than that. The point is: should you wish for something to carry on, if you want a park watered for 100 years after your death, you have a method to ensure that takes place. And if I hold a gun to your head and I say, Give me all your property or I will shoot you, with all other forms of property, if you say No I shoot you can I get it anyway. So the game theory says I should just go ahead and kill you and take your property. But with Bitcoin the game theory says if I shoot you I get none of it, because you go to the grave with your keys. So with Bitcoin the game theory says I should ask for half, right? And it turns out that throughout human history, people have always struggled against governments and onerous groups be-it a monopoly or the like, but in nearly all of those cases, if they got half, they wouldve turned out okay! Like, normally if they kept half  you dont like taxes, but if you kept half of your stuff, you would still be okay. The problem with taxes is they take all of it over the course of some period of time and youve got none. Youve got no recourse, so you cant even negotiate. And it turns out that Bitcoin is the first thing where you can negotiate it. And because you can negotiate it, its property that encourages peaceful resolution. And all other forms of property encourage violent resolution, because the phrase is, Winner takes all, right? All the other properties are winner takes all. I can either negotiate with you and take half  if the bullet costs a dollar and if the gun costs $387 and if you have a million dollars, I can either spend the dollar and take it all, or I can negotiate peacefully with you and I can take half of it. But, you know, the ROI on that last $1 bullet is $500,000. Its 500,000:1, and so the problem really is: other forms of physical property incentivize violence, and the game theory dictates a violent resolution. And its even worse than that, because the person that lines up ten rich people against the wall and shoots all ten of them ends up getting all their money and theyre able to raise an army and theyre Mussolini or Hitler, and then they get to go line up the next 100, and then you get to line up the next  and then pretty soon youre Stalin, right? Theres a benefit to the most violent, and they get powerful. But with Bitcoin, it works the opposite way, because first of all you cant get all of it with violence. You get none of it with violence. And the second thing is: as soon as I said, Robert, Im going to seize all your Bitcoin, your answer is, No, then when I say, Im sending guys to your house with guns to seize all your Bitcoin, the most likely result is youre going to wire your Bitcoin somewhere else in the universe that I dont know about, or youre going to put a multisignature on it and youre going to say, Look, you can put your guns at me, you can shoot me, you can pull out my fingernails, but I cant give it to you. Its like, Okay, well tell us who else has got the signature? Oh, somebody on a satellite has the signature. How about: a computer program on a satellite has it and theyve locked it up and I cant get it out until you release me and Ive lived happily for 5 years and then I can get it out. How do you negotiate with a computer program on a satellite? But if you dont want that youre just like, Okay well I just send it to somebody else. And now when that happens, the first person that attacks the Bitcoiner, he realizes, That didnt work out so well. And all the Bitcoin leaves your jurisdiction. And so the attack causes a response. What Im trying to say is: if you have 100 people with a billion dollars of gold each in your country you can shoot all 100 and take 100 billion dollars and the game theory says you should. If you have 100 people with a billion dollars of Bitcoin in your country, you could hold a gun, you could incarcerate them all and get half, but you wont, because as soon as you incarcerate one or two of the people, the other 98 will leave the country  the Bitcoin. You will end up with a country where you managed to get half of two peoples Bitcoin, and 98% of the Bitcoin will exist your jurisdiction. So the real game theory says: Bitcoin has an immune system and 98%-99% departs from a hostile political jurisdiction when you start trying to seize the asset. And thats what makes it the apex property. And in the same way, thats what makes it anti-violence. And thats what makes it a cleansing technology for the human race, because Bitcoin promotes civility.", "image": null}

So the physicality of the property itself is what makes it vulnerable to coercion, effectively. The ideal property would be something thats non-physical like Bitcoin. And this really gets to the crux of the value proposition of government and banking  frankly, it was the provision of the security for property. The bank was going to custody your gold, government was going to secure the territory so you could have peaceful commerce. And Bitcoin, by being the asset that has the security innate to it, it enables this radical new level of social scalability, so were eliminating this duplication of efforts that every bank has their own, like you said, accountant, auditor, compliance, IT, HR  youve now just eliminated the need for that. So its such an economizing force as well. Its like, not only is it creating more civility, but its creating more economic efficiency just by virtue of it being non-physical and having in-built security.", "image": null}

So maybe thats one lens to view the significance of its value prop.", "image": null}

And we even got to the best part which is: Bitcoin has dematerialized the accountants, the auditors, the compliance function, the operations function, the HR function, the facilities function, the security function, of every single financial business  money mover or bank  its also dematerialized the civil police and municipal security function everywhere where that function was there to protect property. All property policing. Now the next thing is what happens when two countries disagree? In order to protect your money you need a military, and if you dont have a military, fill in the blank, right? Ask the Spaniards during the Spanish Civil War or ask the French or the Polish people during World War II. If you dont have a military then you lose all your property rights. So the fiat system provides the geo-political security via military, via war, and via politics. And this is where Ill make this interesting point: Bitcoins the first multi-national money. All the fiat currencies are national monies. Gold was a physical money. Weve replaced gold with fiat and with the banking system because we needed to move the money faster, at a higher velocity, and we needed to build new applications on it. So the price we paid was a central bank plus fractional banks. But even so, every single money is a national money, and if you want it to work in the world over time, you got the military, you got the state department in politics, and you got war, and thats the real expense of the fiat system. The fact that every 20, 30, 40 years you have to fight a war be-it World War I or World War II or ______ in order to defend your property. So how does Bitcoin avoid that? Well Bitcoin is a multi-national network and because its challenging to locate the network  like you might be able to locate some of the miners but some miners you cant locate, theyre off the grid. And half of the nodes are off the grid coming through the TOR network  you dont even know where they are. So the network is running orthogonal to geography or political jurisdiction. Its in cyberspace. And that means that geo-political disputes are settled in Bitcoin, but theyre settled without war. So when one nation wants to tax a certain property, they can tax it. Maybe they can put a tax on a Bitcoin miner. But they will either put a tax thats so high that the miners shut down and then all the mining relocates or the network just reconfigures, or they will tax the Bitcoin miners at a level where the miners continue and the network just adjusts. So youve got a peaceable resolution via the political process and there really is no incentive  if I actually raised an army of a million people and I have atomic bombs, I cant use that to get your Bitcoin, and no one else can use it to get mine, so again the trans-national violence is not really encouraged with Bitcoin. And what weve done is we have taken a fiat system that was constructed to make gold money faster, smarter, stronger, and done with the best technology of the 20th century, we have taken that 20th century model and weve replaced it with a 21st century model  Satoshis model  that makes money faster, smarter, stronger again. But in the doing of it, its hard to understate how much inefficiency we eliminate. Like if you replaced all the banks, all the money exchanges, and then half the police department and half the militaries, take half of that entire fiat system thats meant just to protect fiat money flows, take it away, and then what you realize is that Bitcoin is providing that monetary system that does something better a million times cheaper. To say its a thousand times cheaper might be an understatement, but its at least a thousand times cheaper. Its a massive crystallization or a collapsing to a lower energy state where youre able to provide a million times more security and you can move money at the speed of light and you can make it a million times smarter and you can do it a million times cheaper. All of those things at the same time. So that in and of itself is like inventing cold fusion. I could take a sugar cube and I could split the atom or I could take this bottle of water and I could run a fusion reactor on it that could power up the entire civilization for a year off the bottle of water  thats what it will do to the human condition. That kind of breakthrough technology.", "image": null}

And thats really the pretext for war, is people fighting over scarce resources. And if theres one universal, I think its: human beings could agree that war is a bad thing. Its the most uneconomic activity we can possibly engage in. Youre mobilizing capital to go and destroy capital and clearly destroy a lot of human life as well. And I think a good way to look at it is that warin the 20th century, at least this was the violent mode of reaching consensus on property. To decide who owns what, countries would raise armies and go to war and draw the lines on the map and say this is mine, thats yours. And Bitcoin is this alternative mode, its a peaceful mode for reaching consensus. Its like a peaceful alternative to war in a lot of ways.", "image": null}

Why wouldnt I want to store all my lifes work in something which is a spoil of peace? Its just better every way. So just a few more thoughts on the Bitcoin model and proof of work before we go deeper down the rabbit hole into the engineering dynamics. The proof of work model is: I do a bunch of work with energy, I generate a bunch of hashes, I try to solve the problem, I solve the problem, and then I claim the reward. I get paid for my work. The work that the Bitcoin miner is doing is somewhat uncertain  theres no guarantee that youll actually win the block. But somebody is guaranteed to win, right? What youve got is a bunch of people vying for the energy in the system. Every day, 900 Bitcoin get mined, a bunch of transaction fees get paid. All the Bitcoin miners are competing via honest work to win their share of that energy. The other part to the Bitcoin system is the difficulty adjustment. As more miners enter and as the hashrate increases, the difficulty goes up. So you could think about difficulty as a protocol for competition and the proof of work algorithm is the protocol for work. So another way to say this is: the Bitcoin network rests on competitive work. Now thats unique to a financial system, right? We never did it before with the fiat system. You could argue we kind of did something similar with gold. I mean gold is: you do a lot of work, the work is mining the gold, and theres no guarantee that youll find the gold, but if you do find the gold then you get to sell the gold and you get paid for it. So theres some benefit. And then as more people get into gold mining, it gets more competitive one way or the other. So gold is a little bit like this, but I think that the more interesting idea here is that work and difficulty and Bitcoin feel a lot like the work and the difficulty in capitalism. So Bitcoin is a microcosm of capitalism. If you look at every single industry, what is the industry? Well I work in this industry, I work really hard to win customers, and I get paid  theres no guarantee Ill get them  if I launch a restaurant my restaurant may fail but it may succeed. If more people set up a restaurant then it gets harder for me. Maybe the market will grow, maybe it wont. I dont know. Theres uncertainty, theres competition. Whats pretty clear is that Im incompetent if I dont get up and go to work every day. I cant guarantee you youll mine the next block, but I can guarantee you if you turn off the Bitcoin mine, you wont mine the next block. I cant guarantee you that your movie will be a hit, but I can guarantee you that if you dont make the movie or you dont finish the movie it wont be a hit. So in capitalism youve got thousands and thousands of industries and markets. Youve got groups of competitors, everybody is working. Some people come up with better technique. Theres S19 miners  theyre better than S9 miners. Invent a new Bitcoin miner, right? You can invent a new technique, you can run it harder, you can find a cheaper raw material. The same thing in Bitcoin mining goes on with every other industry. So capitalism is a proof of work with a difficulty adjustment. The difficulty adjustment is taking place  try launching your own mobile phone company in the year 2021 against Apple Computer. The difficulty has gotten pretty high!", "image": null}

If youre generating 30% profit margin, other entrepreneurs come in to try to feast on that profit margin. That is the difficulty adjustment in capitalism. The industry then becomes more competitive, it becomes more difficult to succeed. And then the opposite is also true: if you start generating losses, you actually expel competition. People go out of business. So its so interesting to look at it that way, and Ive called Bitcoin in the past kind of a fractal of the free market. Like its its own little free market that imposes free market principles at large.", "image": null}

You could say that Satoshi was creating a competitive, honest work system to allocate the responsibility for the network and the rewards of the network. But you could also say its modeled on a classic engineering control system. Its a first-order negative feedback loop. And if you look at the way that any aerospace airfoil  any airplane, any control system, any ballistic system, any targeting system works  you have these control systems and then youve got several mechanisms and cybernetic mechanisms and its like, I try this, I miss, I adjust, I try again, and youve got a negative feedback in order to converge. The negative feedback of Bitcoin is the difficulty adjustment, and the control parameter is trying to converge on one block every 10 minutes to stay on schedule. Its not unlike an autopilot if youre trying to get from Point A to Point B over the course of a hundred units of time, and youve gone 1 minute and you want to get there in 100 minutes. If youre behind, you check, and you go faster. And if youre ahead of schedule, you check, and you go slower. Because you want to end up doing 100% of the work in 100 minutes, so theres your negative feedback loop. Youll find this is built into thermostats, its built into autopilots, its built into all sorts of things in the engineering world. And its built into every capitalist market. Now, Ill make one more point: Bitcoins based on capitalism. Capitalism is based on nature. Where else do you see an example of work and difficulty? Its like: hunting. Im a predator, I get up in the day, I hunt. Is there any guarantee I will get anything? No. What happens if I dont hunt? Theres a 100% guarantee I will starve. What happens if I do hunt? Maybe I will be the best hunter that will catch the gazelle. Maybe I will get unlucky and someone else less worthy than me will catch the gazelle. There is uncertainty. Maybe I will catch all the gazelle and theres no more gazelle and I will have to change my parameters. So in nature the prey, the predator are in this constant equilibrium  all the plants, all life forms  theyre all working. What are they working to do? To capture energy from the ecosystem. The trees are trying to get the sunlight, right? The prey are trying to eat the leaves of the trees. And the predators are trying to eat the prey. And the difficulty is  if all the giraffe eat all the leaves of the trees then only the giraffe with the longest neck can reach the leaves that are left, and all the giraffes with a short neck starve to death. Thats the difficulty adjustment. The difficulty adjustment is the slowest or the unluckiest creature gets eaten, and thats good. But the next week, all the wolves have to catch creatures that are faster than any creature theyve ever caught before. And vice versa. So youve got continual feedback and evolution and survival of the fittest.", "image": null}

Its an adaptive control system for money. And maybe its the first adaptive monetary system. And what is it adapting? What is the control function? The control function is  if we come back to our last set of discussions  what is the critical definition of ideal money? Shared, immutable, correct ledger. So what is Bitcoin? Well, Bitcoin is an adaptive control system and its targeting correct. Its self-correcting. Its a self-correcting monetary system. For example: how does gold go off the rails? Well I started with 21 million gold coins and then someone sacked the Inca empire and brought back 10 million more. Now Ive got 31 million gold coins. Well wheres the self-correcting part? I dont want 31 million, I want 21 million. I just diluted the value of the civilization by 30%. Its not self-correcting. Someone made 2% gold  its not self-correcting. Okay well if you have 2% error every year in a thermostat, well the thermostat you grew up with as a kid if going to fry you by the time youre 47. What happens if you add 2 degrees a year to a thermostat? Well its going to be 182 degrees by the time you retire. Your books are going to burn at Farenheit 451  just give it a few years! You cant tolerate 2% drift, much less 7% drift. All of these adaptive control systems  like the steam engine is based on negative feedback, thermostats, even longitude. John Harrison when he invented longitude  we talked about it  how do you find longitude in the ocean? You need two clocks. How do I actually get two clocks to keep time when you have heat thats compressing and expanding the material in the clock? The answer is: I have to sandwich in or wedge three different layers, and one layer has to contract as the other expands so they off-set so that you eliminate the bias. You cant afford to have any flex. You need perfect  like how do I get a watch to run true? I cant have it lose 2 seconds a day or 5 seconds a day. I need perfect timings. Otherwise youre going to miss by 100 meters, right? And so all of engineering is all about error-correction and adaptive control systems. So Bitcoin is a self-correcting monetary system, and fiat isnt, and gold isnt, and commodity money isnt. Because theres nobody that can play God. If God could reduce the number of gold coins to 21 million every time someone tried to slide another one in there, it would be self-correcting. When you lost something or you shaded it or counterfeited it or whatever, if you had some deity then maybe youd have a self-correcting system but we dont. We know the fiats are  theres no truth to them. No one even knows how many dollars there are, right? There are two things we dont know in this world: how many ounces of gold there are, and how many dollars there are. And theres one thing we do know: how much Bitcoin has been created and how much will be created. So I think that taken in its entirety, what Satoshi engineered was an adaptive control system for money. A self-correcting system. And ultimately a natural system, a natural, conservative, organic system. If I look at creatures in the wild and they have to compete in their ecology, in their ecosystem all the time, then theyre healthy. And when I make them zoo creatures they stop competing and at the point that you become a zoo creature and youre fed and youre sitting in a chair watching Netflix, you become progressively less healthy, and you become more fragile. So all of these fiat currencies are zoo creature money. Theyre not natural. When we say, Thats not natural, when you think about it you realize the things that are healthy are natural, because nature is conservative. And by conservative I dont mean politcally conservative, I mean physically, thermo-dynamically conservative. Nature never takes 22 creatures and turns it into 57 million creatures overnight. If you have 22 and 3 die you have 19. Nature is conservative  there are consequences. And if a wolf eats all the deer and there are no more deer, then the wolf starves to death and then the deer come back because there are consequences. Bitcoin is wonderfully engineered because A) the protocol is conservative and mathematically correct, B) the proof of work algorithm is an honest work, it is an open egalitarian work, anyone can do that work  I can do that work with brute force energy, I can do that work with new machinery, I can do that work anywhere in the world, no one can stop me from doing that work, ergo its an open natural system, its not a closed system. Your zoo creature is living in a closed, air-conditioned system, and the wild animals living in an open system, wild animals are going to evolve and adapt to an open environment which is much more challenging. Zoo creatures are going to adapt to a closed environment. Whats an example of an adaption to a closed environment? Youre 300 lbs overweight because you sit in a chair watching Netflix. There are no fat predators.", "image": null}

This is then maybe the commonality between life and Bitcoin, is that each is really just a survival strategy at the end of the day. Your DNA is the collective lessons of your survival strategy across history, and its kind of like an organic blockchain and Bitcoin is just this survival strategy for money. Life is that strategy propagating through flesh, Bitcoin is propagating through code, and both of them are error-correcting their own behavior. Life is intelligently figuring out what it needs to do to advance itself to extend its DNA into the future, and Bitcoin is adapting to human behavior to extend itself into the future.

And Bitcoin was cybernetic life released into the wild because proof of work is inherently permissionless, which means that it was meant to live in all environments and to go everywhere and you cant keep it caged. To the extent you try to keep it caged, then you lose control of it. There are other forms of cybernetic life that have been designed not to go in the wild, like a proof of stake system. A proof of stake is more like a barnyard animal or a zoo creature  youve designed a domesticated pet which is kind of toothless and maybe its got pretty feathers, but it was never meant to live in the jungle.

{"title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 12 | Why Bitcoin Succeeds", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-12-why-bitcoin-succeeds-e493a777426f?source=user_profile---------11-------------------------------", "body": "So Bitcoin as money. Simply put, Bitcoins the best money the human race has ever had the ability to embrace. We know gold is defective because of its mechanical nature, and we know fiats defective because of its political nature. Why does Bitcoin work? Bitcoin has the things that you need in order to construct a shared, immutable, correct ledger. Thats our target. Shared, immutable, correct ledger. And Bitcoins got a base layer protocol. The base layer protocol was genetically embedded in the system from day one  the 21 million coins is one of the critical parts of it. The 2.1 quadrillion satoshis and no more than that. The second part of the protocol is not just the mathematical coin parameter, its also the proof of work security model. So when we created it, [Satoshi] created it with the 21 million coin limit, he created it with the proof of work security model, and that is the part that makes it more likely to be immutable and shared and correct. And the third part is the balance of power between the miners, the nodes, and the walletsor the HODLers. It wasnt inevitable that you had to build it this way. Bitcoin is an engineered monetary system, so its a feat of engineering. They built a protocol, they chose components  they chose cryptography, they chose proof of work  all of these are engineered components. And the balance of power between the miners, the nodes, and the HODLers with the wallets  that became clear in the block size wars I think. And following the block size wars  I mean first miners were the nodes and then the miners and the nodes split, and eventually we saw that the nodes themselves had a huge amount of power to check the power of the miners, but now were seeing the emergence of the power of the HODLers, and of course  all three of these dimensions are decentralized. So I would say that we need the protocol, the base layer, that base layer protocol that I just described that replaces the gold that was here at the beginning of the universe, and it replaces the base layer protocol thats the political artifact of any kind of fiat currency. The second thing that Bitcoin has that makes it a much better money is it has an application layer protocol. The base layer protocol ensures that well never have more than 21 million Bitcoin. I mean thats the most important thing. And then it ensures  what do I need? I need durability, integrity, and security. So I need to know that there will never be more than 21 million Bitcoin even 1,000 years from now, I need to know that people arent going to monkey with material things like the frequency or the block size  thats the integrity part of it  and I guess durability and integrity they go arm-in-arm in a way because if you change the frequency and the block size you may inadvertently end up changing the limit [of Bitcoin] at some point because you break it. And then you need security: you need to know that no malefactor can hack it or break into the network. So were getting all of those things  the security, the integrity, the durability, via the base layer protocol. But the application layer protocol is also important, and thats the ability to do final settlement transactions at the base layer with a Bitcoin wallet address, and we could debate, interestingly Robert, like: do you need Lightning or not? And thats an interesting debate, because I think that if we just had the ability to do base layer transactions on the Bitcoin network, the system is still perfected enough to serve as a monetary system. You would end up with the layer 2 application being built via counterparties with some counterparty risk instead of what you can do with Lightning. But the combination of base layer transactions via Bitcoin wallet and then layer 2 transactions via Lightning wallet, I think those two things together are clearly superior as an application-level protocol. And if you group them together and say that is the non-custodial decentralized open source protocol for moving money around in the Bitcoin standard, then youve got the structure of something really compelling. Another way to describe this is: Bitcoin gives you a base layer protocol to move large sums of money around at small cost in an hour, and it gives you a layer 2 protocol to move mid-level and small sums of money around instantly for almost nothing. On my Lightning wallet I can move 1,000 satoshis at the cost of 1 satoshi in a second. Which is more efficient. I can move 100,000 satoshis, which is like $30  I can move $30 for 1 satoshi in a second. That makes that layer 2 protocol faster and more efficient than any other currency transfer protocol that Im aware of in the history of the world.", "image": null}

And my understanding of it is: as the network proliferates and the network density grows, that the transactions per second actually increase.

And so I think thats critical. I think Lightning is probably something thats going to accelerate the spread of Bitcoin, and its the logical next step. If we can engineer a decentralized non-custodial crypto-asset network based on private keys and cryptography and the like as Bitcoin, then theres no reason why we couldnt engineer a layer 2 of Bitcoin thats also non-custodial and decentralized that makes a different set of trade-offs. In essence, I think the Lightning Network is a decentralized, open, proof of stake network. But the critical issue is: its a proof of stake network not staked with its own token  its staked with the underlying token of Bitcoin, which makes it a much higher integrity, much longer-living, more secure open decentralized network, than one that was created with its own token, which would be self-referential.", "image": null}

Which makes sense. So weve got two things: weve got a base layer protocol, and weve got an application layer protocol. And so why does the Bitcoin standard work? Or why is Bitcoin the best monetary system? How does it succeed in reality? Well, lets start with inflation. The scourge of inflation which destroys fiat and destroys gold doesnt exist. In Bitcoin youve got a conservative system and a mathematically complete system. So its mathematically correct and it is conservative in a thermodynamic sense that we dont add additional energy in the system nor does it deplete energy in the system. And the basis of that conservation is that base layer protocol. The base layer protocol plus the proof of work together. You couldnt design the system which wasnt conservative. Just because you get everything else right  if Satoshi had gotten everything else right but had left some randomness or some inflation in the token count, it wouldnt have been ideal. The second thing that is a big attribute for it is the difficulty of confiscation. So the private keys of cryptography are the strongest property rights in the history of the human race. So if we think about cryptography as the basis of property rights, then truthfully the only property you can really own is digital property on a secure crypto-asset network, of which the only one we know of is Bitcoin. So right now, the only property you can truly own is Bitcoin. Look, if we ever went to Alpha Centauri and we went to a new planet and we cut off communication with the Earth, its possible that the dictator of Alpha Centauri could spin up another Bitcoin network  Centauri network. And if it was a closed system and it had the same exact mathematics as this, as it spread as a virus and infected the billions of people in Alpha Centauri it would be its own crypto-asset network. So you can imagine something like that, but right now what youve got is one successful life form and that is Bitcoin. And so youve got one successful digital property and now we actually have an engineered property and so you have a scientific basis for property rights. Weve never had it before. Its illustrated pretty effectively. Its like, if you have a million dollars and you convert the million into a building, well the building can be seized by the mayor by eminent domain. You can lose your building and you cant move the building. So the building is impaired property and the building can be taxed. It is immobile, it can be seized, it could be taxed, and it also has physical nexus which means a meteorite can fall on it or an earthquake can wipe it out, so there are risks to the building. The useful life of the building is 100 years, maybe less if its poorly constructed. And its only appealing to people in that geographic-political nexus. If the building was in North Korea, how valuable is a building in North Korea to an investment company in New York City? So a building as property leaves a lot to be desired. Land as property has the same issue. A block in Manhattan is a lot more valuable than a block in the middle of the desert, because the land is geographically located next to a lot of investors with a lot of money that can actually develop the land for some economic purpose. And the land can be impaired and taxed. Property tax  theres a phrase: in the real estate business they always talk about triple net, and triple net is like, After your taxes, after your expenses, etc. So these are high-maintenance properties. Theyre very expensive and not very portable. So you can rifle through the properties. Well theres art, theres gold, theres silver, theres commodities, theres securities, there are bonds, there are currency baskets. They all have some liability, many of them are currency derivatives and so as currency derivatives they have dilution coming from the inflation of the underlying currency. But the ones that have physicality are subject to search and seizure and impairment because you cant move them. Others are unique, maybe, but even though you might own art people are going to keep making more art. And so if youre looking for a property that no one can seize, that is hardest to impair, Bitcoin is the hardest to impair property. Technically I would say its probably the hardest to tax, the hardest to destroy, the hardest to seize, and the hardest to impair, of any property available to you to purchase at this point.", "image": null}

If I shoot you in the head you cant take your gold with you. The Egyptian pharaohs built the Pyramids to take the gold with themthey were all robbed. If I said to you, Take the million dollars and buy some property and then youre going to be murdered by somebody in your family next week  buy some property that they wont get after youre dead  what is that property?", "image": null}

Gold  all these things are seizable. You cant take them with you. But if you hold Bitcoin and you hold the private keys in your head, when you die, the Bitcoin goes with you and no one else gets their hands on it. And the significance of that is: because its impossible to confiscate with force and because it disappears with your death, then any hostile actor always has an incentive to negotiate with you because its better for me to hold a gun to your head and take half of it than pull the trigger and get none of it. And thats not true with any other property. In all other cases I can pull the trigger and get all of it. And so you have an unstable situation with that property. And the interesting thing is: that confiscation element, it works at the individual level, the institutional level, and the nation-state level. So if one nation is going to declare war on another nation and murder everybody, they get their gold. They also get their land. They also get their factories. I mean theres a joke, neutron bomb  Ill just nuke you and well leave the cities. I might get the gold, the silver, the farmland, the buildings, the factories, the ships  but I wouldnt get the Bitcoin. And so Bitcoin is not spoils of war. Other things may be, but Bitcoin is not spoils of war. With regard to a bank or a financier, if you own the Bitcoin and someone puts a claim against you, the way it normally works is: Ive got a million dollars with the bank and I borrow against it and then they decide to mark my securities down and they force-liquidate me and they sell all of my securities and take my property. That happened with Archegos. I mean it happens all the time. It happens all the time with crypto exchanges. If you have the crypto on the exchange, or your Bitcoin, and you borrow against it and you cant meet a margin call, they can force-liquidate your assets and they seize them. But if you pull your assets off the exchange and if you hold your private keys, then your bank cant seize your assets in a hostile fashion  they would be more likely to negotiate with you. And because you can take custody of it, you dont necessarily need to rely upon this all-or-nothing: either I give you all my stocks and I borrow against them or I have none of them. We could split the difference with: I give you proof that I have it  proof of reserves  without transfer of the asset, in return for a different type of loan.", "image": null}

I think all stress will accelerate the adoption of new technology. For example, when people are fighting wars, like when we were fighting wars we were hauling over C130s or air freighters full of pallets of cash, right? So normally the way you fight wars is with gold or with cash or with something. And if youre cut off and you need to buy or sell materials of some sort, you need hard currency. So I think that yeah it will accelerate the adoption of technology like Bitcoin. And coming back to this issue: because its not confiscatable, it doesnt invite violence on your person from other family members. Like for example, do you ever worry about being murdered by a family member because of whatever your will says? If you had your Bitcoin in a multisignature relationship or a multisig something-or-other, then maybe it changes that dynamic. So I think all sorts of violence against the individual, against the company, against the institution, or against the municipality or the nation-state  I think those are all less likely. Less likely to happen and more likely to result in negotiation. So why else is Bitcoin going to succeed? Why does it succeed? Well because hypothecation is so much more difficult. Im not saying impossible, but the layer 1 and the layer 2 protocols  Bitcoin and Lightning  those mitigate the need for hypothecation. Its less likely you would need to trust all your assets. If I can move 1% of my assets a day for a satoshi, then I wouldnt put all my assets in a bank. Right now all of your assets, all your stocks, are probably in a bank. You dont hold any of them. In theory you could actually take possession of your stocks as certificates and put them in a safe deposit box  take them out of street name, they say.", "image": null}

So the protocols mitigate hypothecation, and also they punish hypothecators. If someone did go naked short Bitcoin in order to make a quick dollar and you pulled all your Bitcoin off the exchange and they have to then settle, it creates a massive short squeeze. So whenever you pull those securities away from the hypothecator then they get squeezed. So if I knew that it was impossible, like if you had a billion in gold and I knew youre never going to take delivery of it, I can short it 100:1. And if I knew youd never take delivery of the Bitcoin I might get a little bit cute, but in a world where people can  there are exchanges that fail just like there are bad banks that fail, its just that theyre failing continually in Bitcoin because thats the nature of the free market and thats how the free market squeezes out defective actors and malicious actors. And the ones that have perfected security and the like, they succeed. So the fourth dimension of virtue for Bitcoin is superior authentication. And again the layer 1, the layer 2 protocols and cryptography in general what you can do  proof of keys and the like, proof of reserves  they solve the authentication issue. And maybe it solved for the first time, effectively, when you want to settle and you want to buy a piece of real estate sometimes it takes a week or two weeks to do a title search and its a manual process so youre talking about a hyper-expensive manual process to even do a title search on a small amount of property. And Bitcoin gives you a way  I mean presumably its somewhere between 1,000%-1,000,000% cheaper and faster. Like its not an order of magnitude, its many orders of magnitude better on the authentication. And maybe even more important than that, you can automate the authentication. So that means that a computer program could authenticate 100,000,000 different HODLers every hour for a nickel. And when you get to that level that opens up the possibility to create new types of businesses and new types of applications that otherwise would have been cost-prohibitive because of the friction involved. Bitcoin succeeds over fiat based upon transportation dynamics too  the fifth element of virtue. Its fast on layer 1, and its instant on layer 2. Moving $100,000,000 of property on layer 1 in an hour is fast, but moving $100,000 on layer 2 in a second for nearly free is instant. And so its just much faster. And it comes with no artificial geo-political constraints. Even when you have fast on fiat, you have fast but with the geo-political constraints that are continually shifting. Whereas fast on Bitcoin has no geo-political jurisdiction, its cyberspace. Its orthogonal to geo-political space. And what you want is a situation where a billion people in China could all authenticate themselves and trade on a value network through the great Chinese firewall to a website sitting in Cuba or sitting in the US. Youll never do that with any kind of fiat system. In fact, the entire Chinese system is constructed to create a capital firewall so that capital cant flow out of China or in China. The central bank chokes it in order to maintain the RMB peg versus the Dollar. So that idea that I can cross that layer instantly, that means that I can build a value exchange into a billion transactions a minute, and I can build a value exchange that flows in a billion transactions a minute for a billion people across 100,000,000 different applications. And they can all move fluidly, right? So I guess its the difference between, if you want a metaphor  liquid fluid flow into a container  thats Bitcoin and Lightning. Or, you take 1 kg gold blocks or even 400 oz London good delivery bars, you can build whatever you want with those. But one of them is like LEGO that are 400 oz each, and the other is water  liquid, or air. Theres just no comparison between the two.", "image": null}

You can imagine a tornado with air and water, or a whirlpool, or a cyclone. You just cant imagine that with big bars of gold, because ones discrete and the others continuous.

But LEGO  you cant design a rocket nozzle with LEGO. Youre not going to design the wing of a supersonic airfoil with LEGO. You need continuous fluid dynamics.", "image": null}

And its all rooted in this precision of customer choice. Similar with the LEGO, you dont have as much option with the big block, but if youre at the molecular level of the fluid you have a lot of optionality.", "image": null}

And are you dancing using 2-ton granite blocks? Or are you dancing using water? With air? And what structures can you create? If we take all those things together and you consider the consequences for distribution, Bitcoin is something that can be distributed to everybody on Earth for effectively free, so its truly liquid. What I need is if I wanted to distribute something to 8 billion people and I wanted 8 billion transactions an hour forever  like I want that degree of fluidity  I need to do it at the price of a satoshi a transaction. I need to do it with very low friction. So this low-transport cost, this low friction, results in massive distribution. And we can see with gold, for example, there isnt 1 oz of gold for everybody in the world to give to them, and so theres no way to distribute money with gold. And if we take fiat we know theres 1.7 billion people that are unbanked  maybe more  and we know the ones that are banked are imperfectly banked and the banks dont cross-connect, so we cant find a good way to distribute money via fiat or via gold, but via Bitcoin we do have a clear way. The last element is this division, the ability to break it down. I cant break down a gold bar or gold coin. I can sort of break down fiat, but even 1 penny is like too much sometimes. Being able to go down to 1 satoshi is better than 1 penny, expecially because of this one thing: one of the big problems in cybersecurity is spamming and scamming. So I cant use the DMs of my Instagram because 99% of the communication is spam or scam. I cant really use the DMs of non-verified or non-followed individuals on Twitter because of the same thing. I cant really use e-mail without very expensive e-mail filters that are continually filtering out spam and scam and the like, so theres massive amounts of cyber in-security. Every single day  if you have a website  it gets attacked by a denial-of-service attacks all the time. The reason for DDoS attacks and scams and spam is theres no cost to attack it. Theres no skin in the game. And so what we need is to introduce skin in the game. The way to do it is to require a value exchange whenever you move through a router. If you had to pay a price to send a message, at some point you would attenuate large amounts of that scamming, spamming activity. I mean thats why proof of work was created in the first place: Adam Back was trying to come up with a solution to stop spam. But the other thing you can do is you can actually tie the value, say 100,000 satoshis, as a security deposit into your persona online. If you posted 100,000 satoshis to your Twitter account and if they gave you an orange check and that was your security deposit, then the understanding would be, if you misbehave you get fined, and if youre a malicious actor maybe you forfeit the security deposit. This is the way it works when youre renting a home. This is the way it works in all the real-world  youre a bonded laborer? You cant drive a car without proof of insurance, right? So we have these kind of insurance policies or security deposits or performance bonds that pop up all through the real-world economy. And in the absence of all of those, because youre a real-world actor, you have a risk. And the risk is: if you misbehave, you have culpability, youre responsible. You may get pulled over by a cop. If you say something rude to somebodys wife you may get punched in the face. You have either economic skin in the game or you have actual skin in the game. If you walk out onto a bridge that rickety and you screw around and you do back flips you fall off the bridge, you may die. There are consequences in the real world and the economic world but there are no consequences in cyberspace for many of these activities. And so the result is: people actually even create programs to create bots, and I might spit out 100 million fake Michael Saylors to do irrational malicious things, and theyre not even me  they cant die. By the way when you do that thats a denial-of-service attack. The result of that is cyber in-security. So the fluidity, the speed, and the efficiency of the Bitcoin and Lightning Network has the potential to give us a solution to the cybersecurity problem if we simply start to tie a small Lightning wallet or an amount into some of these systems that YouTube, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Twitter, Medium, Reddit  all these other places where people  theres not a day that goes by that someone doesnt post a Michael Saylor video on YouTube offering to get you free Bitcoin. Im like, Thats not me! But theres no verification on YouTube or registration so if you had to actually post some deposit and if you forfeited the deposit  by the way, its not that they dont take down the accounts  they do. They take them down within a day of when I report them. Every day theres ten Michael Saylor accounts that get taken down on Twitter. Its just theres no economic cost. And I understated that, really. The truth is that on my news feed theres a thousand Michael Saylors that have stolen my image and my name. If you charged them all a quarter each it would become a massive revenue source for Twitter, the scammers would immediately realize that theres a cost to attack the system. The amount of malicious behavior would drop by 99%.", "image": null}

The only way you can post something of monetary value in the fiat standard is with a credit card and then you dox yourself and then youre not anonymous anymore. And thats offensive to one group of people that dont want to be identified  they want privacy. But its also prohibitive to another group of people that dont have a credit card. And the third group of people that have a credit card but the credit card wont clear across nation-state boundaries. Bitcoin solves that problem. And it fixes it. So on one hand, one extreme benefit is, Yeah, Bitcoins a way to store a billion dollars for 100 years. On the other extreme, Bitcoins a way for everybody on Twitter to post 30 cents in order to eliminate 99% of the malicious behavior and improve the quality of the experience. Now back to your dance: if Twitter can ask for 100,000 satoshi deposit and if people give it and if Twitters quality of service goes up by an order of magnitude and their cybersecurity enhances, that might put pressure on Instagram. That might put pressure on Google. And ultimately now what you have is every big tech company competing with every other big tech company to improve their service by building Bitcoin into their service, because Bitcoin can eliminate fraud on YouTube. And Bitcoin can eliminate fraud and cyber in-security on Instagram. And so youve got something  its like, Why do I adopt this new technology? Because I can, or because I need to? The early adopter does it because they can, and the later adopters do it because they need to. If PayPal doesnt roll out Bitcoin and Square does, then Square starts to eat PayPals lunch. And if PayPal and Square both roll out Bitcoin and Apple and Google dont, then theyre at a loss, right? So you have competition thats embracing new technology to progress the civilization to a better space. Bitcoins the future for cyberspace. Its the promise of cybersecurity. In fact, thats the great irony: people criticize Bitcoin as maybe being a tool of cyber-hackers, but the ultimate destiny of Bitcoin is to make cyberspace safe for 8 billion people by building it into every cyber-offering and creating skin in the game for every malefactor, and consequences that are not based upon counterparty risk and dont have to be threaded through nation-states or central banks or credit card companies.", "image": null}

Just simply by introducing that risk of loss for agents in the system, youre just incentivizing honesty which is again this grand theme of Bitcoin. And one other benefit that  and this is like a promise of Bitcoin now, its still experimental  but the idea of building social media applications on top of the Lightning Network in a way that theyre actually censorship-resistant. I think that experimentation is very important especially as we see more people being deplatformed, cancelled, censored, etc. So it just seems like theres this potential for Bitcoin to restore honest, unstoppable discourse in the digital age.", "image": null}

Decentralized, open, non-custodial, and they all have promise based upon the core idea. So if we wrap up this entire Bitcoin standard discussion: why does Bitcoin succeed in theory? Well because the base layer protocol is mathematically sound and secure, and the application-layer protocol is sound and its open to upgrade. And therefore the property rights that it delivers are perfected, and theyre open to upgrade. The open network means that you can upgradeand when I say upgrade, maybe upgrade means keep making the Lightning Network better, maybe upgrade means roll out Square cash app with Square cash tags, maybe the upgrade means building it into Apple Pay  what does it mean? It means 100,000 different things. Theres a free market a Darwinian competition to build applications and other types of platforms that are upgrading the Bitcoin protocol, and theyre drawing on the promise of digital property in order to meet some other use case. And there will be some that will succeed, theres going to be some exchanges that fail, some succeed. Theres 100,000 different ways to think about a wallet, right? Some are better than others. The market will sort it out. Weve got a very competitive Darwinian system, but the result is: every intelligent person that encounters Bitcoin, theyre incentivized to find a way to make Bitcoin more valuable. And they might do it by a creative financial application, they might do it with security, they might do it with a device, they might do it with a software program, they might do it by plugging into a different network a different way, and some ideas will be great ideas and other ideas will be good ideas, and some ideas will be bad ideas. And Bitcoin will benefit from the good ideas, it will accelerate from the great ideas, and it will ignore and slough off the bad ideas. And thats something that gold and fiat, they dont have working for them, right? You could imagine some gold applications but youre crippled  gold jewelry, gold goblets, gold coins. And then thats the end of the road with gold. With fiat applications we took that much further  heck we created sovereign debt, we created all sorts of interesting money markets and all sorts of other securities with fiat, we created travelers checks, we created credit cards. You cant say there arent interesting applications  the entire Visa and Mastercard network is kind of a thing of awesome beauty if you compare it to the system of Roman gold coinage, clearly. It got the civilization to where it is. Bitcoin is really just still early days. Were just into the second decade, and these applications and these networks that will be built on it are in some ways a blink of an eye. But you see in the conventional world companies like NYDIG and NYDIG has built a CeFi platform and that platform is being used to deploy Bitcoin-type services to banks downstream. Theyve created a platform so that you could create a credit card that integrates with Bitcoin in some way. So thats layer 2, layer 3. Its a custodial layer 2, not a non-custodial layer 2. You have counterparty risk in NYDIG, but theres nothing that says that it couldnt become a non-custodial Lightning-based platform at some point. Who knows? But thats one approach, and then Lightning is another approach to a layer 2, a non-custodial decentralized layer 2. But theres no monopoly on this, you could create a competitor to it if you wanted to, and then you can create applications like Square Cash App which is another custodial application, but it is an open custodial application so to the extent that you want to you can move your Bitcoin out and move it to another layer 2 platform or to another application or just take self-custody. So theres all these different ways that the network is evolving.", "image": null}

Its relatively cheap to secure. So even if you are taking some counterparty risk with some of these layer 2, layer 3 technologies, a lot of them can be set up to either you withdraw manually or even you automate the withdrawal into self-custody.", "image": null}
{"title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 12 | Why Bitcoin Succeeds", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-12-why-bitcoin-succeeds-e493a777426f?source=user_profile---------11-------------------------------", "body": "Yeah sometimes the hardcore Bitcoiners are a little bit hard on everybody and its like the perfect being the enemy of the good. For example, if I buy the Bitcoin and I trust a counterparty for a week but I have the option to take it off the exchange or out of the mobile app when I want, thats a totally different situation than if I bought a million dollars worth of land in California. You will never in a million years be able to move the million dollars of land in California out of California. So the custodial risk of a building or land is orders of magnitude greater. Youre trusting the mayor of the city and the governor and the nation-state and every bureaucrat, and youre never going to change that. Whereas  look, even if you bought Bitcoin on PayPal when they didnt have the wire out option, people had a big fit on Twitter. But the truth is, so you had some Bitcoin on PayPal and for 6 months you couldnt take custody of it and then after 6 months and the big protest about it eventually they upgraded their wallet and now you can. So it is possible if you buy Bitcoin in certain places that youll be able to custody it or move it somewhere in the next year or two or three years, but its absolutely impossible that you will ever convert a building in New York City into something which moves at the speed of light on the Lightning Network. Not without selling it, liquidating it, paying the capital gain tax on it and converting it. So I think that generally just about all these flavors of Bitcoin are higher-quality property. And sometimes people want to own the Bitcoin outright and I get that because our company owns the Bitcoin outright because we want to be able to transfer and take custody and do whatever we want with it  we want sovereignty over it. But if you were to own Bitcoin in a fund or in an ETF, its still the second-highest quality property you could own. Its not the best property in the universe because the best property in the universe is own the Bitcoin. But the second-best property in the universe is own a Bitcoin derivative that 1-for-1 backed by Bitcoin from a counterparty that you can reasonably trust. And there are plenty of examples where people have buckets of money and they can buy the security but they cant buy the Bitcoin. Its like in some retirement plan and they can buy the security but they cant buy the Bitcoin. And there are lots of investors  trillions of trillions of dollars of money managers  and theyve raised money, I have 10 billion dollars in my portfolio and because of tax code or because of law or because of contracts that I have with my limited partners or my charter, I cant buy that Bitcoin buy I can buy a security based on Bitcoin. And so the real world is a nuanced one where there are lots of different types of capital. Not all capital is fungible. If I have a billion dollars it doesnt mean I can just convert a billion into Bitcoin overnight. I might have 100 million and all I can do is buy land. And I might have another 100 million and all I can do is buy a security. And I might have another 100 million and all I can buy is debt. If that was the case, I would prefer to have debt backed by Bitcoin, land underneath a Bitcoin miner, and a security that is a Bitcoin-backed security, because those three things would be sitting on a stronger foundation of collateral, than to buy three things that have no relationship to Bitcoin. And so thats the value of Bitcoin. Ultimately you compare gold standard to fiat standard to Bitcoin standard and your conclusion is: Bitcoin is simply digital money and digital money is an engineered system to create a shared, immutable, correct ledger. If you were Satoshi and you were doing it again, your checklist would be: Okay how do I make it shared and open? How do I keep it from changing? How do I make it mathematically correct? And then what kind of things can I put in it that will cause the entire world to want to protect it and secure it and improve it over time? Instead of attack it and destroy it? And I think thats what Satoshi created, is this engineered digital asset network that happens to make the best monetary system that the human race has come up with. If theres ever a better one, youll start from those principles of digital money and youll say, How do I make it better? And you could imagine maybe something better, but whats most likely to happen is the Bitcoin blockchain just migrates into the better thing and it goes on, right?", "image": null}

Theres the speed of light, and thats a limit Einstein spent a lot of time talking about, and the speed of light is the rate at which the universe can communicate with itself. And the speed of sound is the mechanical rate at which air can communicate. If youre moving faster than the speed of sound, youre arriving before the molecules can get out of the way. And thats why theres a shock wave, because youre moving too fast. The speed of light is like, thats the speed limit. Now theres a speed of which an idea can move through a social-political economic fluid that we call a culture. How fast can an idea move through a culture? And it would be a function I think of cognitive bandwidth of human beings and distraction and life expectancy of human beings and how fast they speak with each other and how much you sleep. And if you ever look at animals, you ever see some of the animals, the smaller ones seem to move faster than either you or me? Theyre at a much different frequency. They can agree, disagree, careen into a brick wall, come back, regroup, careen into another one, agree again and move forward, all in the amount of time that were deciding whether we should make a decision. Its a frequency. So theres a socio-political frequency, and in the history of science, the structure of scientific revolutions, they just speculate generally new paradigms they take place when the entire old generation dies, so in 30 years an entirely new group of decision-makers take over the government. The person running the army is 50, and the 20-year old will be running the army in 50 years because thats the life expectancy or the career expectancy. So normally its life expectancy to take a paradigm shift, or a generation expectancy, so about 30 years. But sometimes if theres a way certain things get jammed faster and they get jammed faster because your life expectancy on Normandy Beach wasnt 30 years, right? If you do something egregiously  like assuming you cling to horses and you reject machine guns, that was an irrational behavior that could last from 1905 to 1914. But it didnt last from 1914 to 1915 because there was a war and it was like an instant consequence. So I think that war and disruption accelerates consequence. In the absence of that its a generational thing, and then youd have to crank in the rate at which information moves now. For example I feel like information moves on YouTube much faster now than 5 years ago or 10 years ago. Information moves on Twitter faster.", "image": null}

So information is moving at a broader scale, theres a much more competitive battle over ideas. Good ideas travel faster, mediocre ideas dont travel at all they get stamped out, the race is evolving a bit faster. But having said all that, like Warren Buffett has still got a lot of money, right? Has he listened to 10 hours of content on Bitcoin yet? Probably not, right? So somebody controls $100 billion and they havent spent 10 hours thinking about it. So what happens?

So what is an example of stronger money? Well, Im in London. I have $100 million worth of money. I need to get it to Rome on a telegram, or I need to move it to Rome at the speed of a single horse, and I cant haul that much gold. So I use a letter of credit. If I can project money via some credit network  whether its the Rothschilds network or its an imperial network or something else  then Ive got stronger money, and Ive got faster money. And if I can offer you that money in return for 3% interest, it becomes smarter money  smarter meaning I created an application that does something complicated. Like when I give you money for 30 days and at the end of 30 days you have to pay it back to me plus 4%, I created a derivative of the base-layer money, or a security of sorts. So the ability to create securities and the ability to project them distances with speed enables a more sophisticated economy and its good for economic productivity. Hence the idea of a fiat. And I think the earliest fiats were like [the] trading stations in the French territories of Canada. They had credits: credit systems on ships, merchant credit systems. There have always been private credit systems. And then eventually there became municipal credit systems, like the mayor of the city-state or something, or mayor of a hamlet, and then you get to statewide systems and federal systems and agency systems and who knows whether or not churches didnt generate their own credit systems. And we know in the military, the military generates credit systems. Theyll have credit vouchers or travel vouchers in the military. I remember the airlines used to give you these tickets where you could fly space available, and they would give them to their employees like flight attendants. So the flight attendants are able to use that and give one to their wife or husband. And they sell those things! There actually became a secondary market in travel vouchers because they had monetary value. And so you have private monies and you have public monies and then you have quasi-public monies from any kind of food stamp or institutional voucher or military voucher that gives you a right to something of value  [it] becomes money in and of its own, in time. So the real question is, Why does fiat fail? We know why it works. The reason it works better than gold is because you put it on a piece of paper, and ultimately the rise of databases along with the ability to shuffle paper around meant that its a lot easier to create an application of fiat base-layer money  all Ive got to do is take a check. Every time I write a check, I created an application, right? Hey, pay Robert Breedlove $792.27. Doing that in a fiat standard takes about 20 seconds. Creating $792.27 of gold is impossible for all but one in 100,000 people and would take a day. So its pretty obvious why it works  because you can create applications faster, you can create more beautiful, complicated applications, types of credit, you can move them around faster. And you can travel with them further distances. And also, they dont invite violence to the same degree. A very famous example of a private money that was created in my youth was American Express travelers checks. And I dont know if you remember American Express travelers checks, they actually became popular before the credit card. If people were going to travel internationally, and you were going to go to some place, they would say, Well, before you go, you should convert your money into American Express travelers checks. I mean, literally, this is a big business. And the number one use case was: that way, if you lose them or theyre stolen, you can get them replaced. The idea was you were less likely to be robbed if you were carrying the travelers check.", "image": null}

And American Express made all their money because people would buy $100 million to travelers checks and only redeem $95 million. And there was the float. And then there was the unredeemed amount. And that was the difference. People used to be very excited about these sorts of things. I mean a travelers check is almost like a derivative of a derivative. The paper money is on top of the gold or itself, although now I guess paper money is the base-layer money, and the travelers check was on top of that. People liked that idea, and then I suppose the credit card is just another example of a fiat application. The idea is: you would send your kid on vacation with a credit card feeling comfortable that you could reload the credit card if they ran out of money. But if your kid said, Dad, I need $25,000 in cash just in case I have an emergency and I need I need an emergency appendectomy or something like that  theres no way you want them traveling with that. And of course, they couldnt even get across the border with $10,000 of cash. So 99% of the world has more than $10,000 that they could put on a credit card. But nobody can take $10,000 in cash. So the fiat standard is appealing because of the portability of the purchasing power and because it doesnt invite violence. If someone steals your credit card, you can cancel the credit card. If they stole your travelers checks, you could cancel the travelers checks  things like that. Its like, Make sure you write down the serial numbers of your travelers checks  all of these things. But why doesnt it work in the in the modern era? I mean the fundamental problem is: we start with inflation again  the government can create more of it. But here the inflation problem is not a minor problem like gold. Its a major problem. Instead of getting a guaranteed 2% inflation with an occasional 20%, you get a guaranteed  I think Saifedean suggested the number was more like 10-11% guaranteed. 7% guaranteed in the US, more in other countries. So youre getting a guaranteed inflation of somewhere between 7-11% a year, and youre getting occasional inflation of 30% or 40% a year. So the base-layer protocol doesnt work so well. Its not conservative. So if you have a shared ledger thats not conservative, its collapsing. And theres just nothing  I say to people, theres no engineered machine or structure that works with that degree of error or inflation. If you had a 2% leak in your gas tank  over what period, right? If youre leaking 2% a day, your car wont work. So leakage of your swimming pool or a balloon or any kind of electrical system or any thermodynamic system at all, just doesnt work with that much leakage. So the inflation  ironically, right ? inflation implies youre getting more but really, its dilution, in a way. Its guaranteed dilution or depletion. So the first problem with fiat is its just depleting energy at too rapid a rate. If we just said 10% a year on average, then a system which is losing 10% of its energy every single year or almost 1% a month  its kind of a crippling first-order problem on the base-layer. Its almost like if Im building on sand, and the sand was sinking 10 feet a year. What structure can you build? When youre building on something, you want to build on granite and you want the minimum deflection. Granite doesnt deflect, steel doesnt deflect. Sand and clay deflects, swampland deflects. So the problem that we start with is the base-layer is collapsing. The second problem of the fiat standard is confiscation. The government can seize your currency or they can seize the asset. To a lesser extent other people can seize it. I mean if you carry your cash around theres that famous image of Pablo Escobar sitting and burning $100 bills to stay warm. If you can carry it around someone with a gun can seize it, so thats a problem. If you dont carry it around then the counter-party that you trusted it with  generally the bank  can seize it. And in all cases, generally the government can seize it. And so these are three fundamental defects with the fiat standard: (1) your property rights are weak under the confiscation risk, and (2) your property is defective because of the constant inflation. You literally bought swampland in Florida thats sinking. Its worse than that! Because swampland doesnt sink forever  its pretty much as bad as its gonna get. This is worse than that, because it just keeps getting worse and worse and worse.", "image": null}

Theres like a conundrum of money here, where this is the tool or the economic medium thats intended to be trust-minimized. So you can put your wealth there and you dont need to trust anyone else. Its like a safe place to park wealth. But to get that you come with all these limitations of gold, historically. So to pick up these stronger, faster, smarter qualities of money comes with a cost of counter-party risk. The conundrum is: gold, you can trust nobody  you dont need to trust anyone  but you cant really trade with anyone because of all of its limitations. Or you can use fiat, in which you need to trust a lot of counter-parties, but you can trade with a lot of people. So theres this conundrum weve been stuck between, historically. And Bitcoin is the answer: its the collapse of the counter-party risk.", "image": null}

The counterparty risk is the explanation for inflation, right? The governments inflating it. And the counterparty risk is the root problem with confiscation. But again, even if you had your cash in your pocket, you dont have counterparty risk in the near term, but what you do have is an invitation to violence, its too difficult to move it, then youve got counterparty risk in the form of hypothecation, which is the third problem. Which is: you put your money in the bank  maybe they wont steal it  but theyre making more of it because theyre loaning it out with a reserve ratio of 1:10 or 1:20 and so you put a million in the bank and they create 10 million more which dilutes your million. So the hypothecation is the third failing of a fiat standard. The fourth is the authentication again, because remember we want to actually be able to move it distances, but you cant authenticate it over a distance in its bearer instrument form, because you cant pay for something with cash. The way to authenticate it is through a counterparty. So I have to put my money in a bank, the bank has to issue a credit card, then I have to input the credit card into the website, then maybe the credit gets approved, then I have to do the transaction, and maybe the transaction gets approved, and maybe it doesnt get approved, and it doesnt cross all borders. It would be impossible to do a transaction via credit card with a vendor in Cuba, or Nigeria, or China, all sorts of places where if you cross central banks, the credit cards dont cross those jurisdictions. So that is another way of saying its an authentication and a transportation problem. How do I transfer transport fiat currency? How do I transform transport a million dollars? Do you know any private individual thats ever moved a million in cash over a commercial airline? Theres almost a presumption that if you had a million dollars of cash in your luggage that youre a criminal, right? Isnt that interesting? Theres a presumption that if you try to do it yourself as a bearer instrument, that youre a criminal. And so what we have is we have a monopoly on transportation through the banks. But the banks only can really move within the central bank network, otherwise they have to cross central banks. So the monopoly is at the bank level, then the central bank level, and then the central banks answer to the government state departments. So the central bank of the US wont do business with the central bank of Cuba. Period. Wont happen. So transportation across jurisdiction is difficult and dangerous where its possible. It either works  youre either in the zone where its working, like youre in the US moving money between Bank of America and Citigroup at 3pm on a Tuesday  and then maybe it works. Although the truth is like I get denied, I try to do little credit card transactions between my credit card and my phone  I get denied like a third of the time.", "image": null}

Anything like that. If it looks like its a transfer. You get all sorts of limits on the rate at which you can move money. And if you want to go to higher volumes  if you wanted to move $50,000 or $100,000  invariably you have to have a trusted banker, a human being thats calling you on the phone to move those wires. So the way that we move large sums of money is between 9pm and 5pm with a trusted banker with a manual authentication. I mean it feels to me like that hasnt changed in 30 years, right? So you cant move outside of the 9-to-5, and you cant do it without that trusted banker, and you cant cross any kind of technical jurisdiction or any kind of political jurisdiction thats not in their free-fly zone. And the result of that is that the impedance to move that money is extreme. So on one side it might take you 72 hours and the real cost is hundreds of dollars. On the other side, if we go back to the credit card network though, you have a monopoly in the credit card network and the result is a 2.5% credit card fee. So where the money does move, theres the 2.5% fee. And thats under the best of cases. But the remittance network gets up to 10% sometimes. So youve got fees that range from 2.5% to 10%. If youre lucky, you get one of those cashback cards. And so the effective cashback is 1.5% or something. So the effective cost is only 1%. But its 100 basis points, which is a huge amount of money  insanely large amount of money  and the network really isnt competitive and it hasnt changed much in 30 years. And theres massive fraud charge-back issues.", "image": null}

I think that your property is impaired. It is taxed. And its either explicitly taxed by a government, a municipality, a state or federal government, or its privately taxed by the money transfer network thats charging you a fee to move it around. And thats a challenge. So transportation: either difficult or dangerous or its impossible or its expensive. Those are the problems with that. And then that leads to two other real deficiencies in the fiat standard. One, youve got a lot of credit failures, because lots of complex debt is layered on top of the base layer money. And thats complex debt and credit instruments with counterparty risk. Check kiting, check fraud, or any anything like that where someones stood in to pay  lots of fraud and lots of credit failure  and then youve got securities fraud. And with security fraud, what I mean by that is theres too many complex applications that are constructed based upon a counterpartys representation to you, and theres no way for you to transparently authenticate or assure yourself that the application is properly constructed and properly backed. And youre destined to have that. Someone says, Oh, we have $2 billion in reserves. But they dont  but you dont know they dont, and then theres a collapse of the securities they issued or the credit or the vouchers or whatever they issued. So that those things are inevitable. And the question is, Why? Why do you have credit bubbles? And then, Why do you have securities fraud on top of the fiat standard? And I think the answer  we come back to our base first principles  is: the base layer protocol of fiat is defective. The base layer money is defective. Is it a shared, immutable, correct, ledger? And the answer is, No. Its not shared. Its not immutable. Its not correct. Its an imperfectly, heterogeneously-shared, mutable, incorrect ledger. So I guess what you could say is its a ledger, right?", "image": null}

You dont have final settlement so you have massive fraud on the credit card network, you have transfers that didnt take place that are represented to have taken place, you have balance sheets that dont exist that are represented to exist. You have an issue there with the base layer. The second problem you have is the application layer protocol  its random and manual. So the protocol by which I would create applications is a base layer money. Like a security is an application, a credit card is an application. Theres no technical protocol, or [its not] programmable. Theres no API. Its a manual protocol. So every single bank creates their own application. Like, a bank loan is an application of fiat. And every bank executes their own set of loans. And theyre all expected to maintain a certain degree of reserves, right? But theyre audited. And the fact that they have to be audited is proof that theyre all just manually executed and heterogeneous. So theres no transparent, perfected application protocol. And the implication of that is that the applications in the fiat standard have no integrity in a mathematical sense, or a technical sense, or an engineering sense. A physical metaphor is: in the real world, Im standing on solid ground. And in the fiat world, my eyes are closed and someone told me I could take two steps to the left and I would be standing on solid ground. But I dont know that Im standing on solid ground. I dont know that Im 100 feet from the cliff  I might be one foot from the cliff. Someone told me, and I dont have a protocol to ascertain whether it is true or not true. So you could generously say people just make mistakes all the time  I thought you were 10 feet from the cliff, and you only were nine and so thats why youre dead. Maybe its just an honest mistake, right? But then again, maybe it was in my vested interest to tell you youre 10 feet from the cliff and you were really 5 feet from the cliff.", "image": null}

Dont trust, verify. And the securities fraud youre describing culminates in the weapons of financial mass destruction with this huge gigantic derivatives market, which is really premised, I would argue, largely on this gap we have between trade and settlement in the fiat system. Theres no final settlement occurring, which is the verification mechanism. So in that gap, we have an accumulation of hidden risk that ultimately becomes systemic and leads to giant systemic blow ups. And to your point about there being no integrity, its like, Of course theres no integrity. I would say the lack of integrity is synonymous with corruptibility. And so not only does it not have mathematical integrity or financial Integrity but you could ultimately say theres no moral integrity because these systems just dont hold up to corruption.", "image": null}

So therefore, I trust it to the bank. I take their gold derivative and I assume that that is base layer money. And I cant take delivery of a billion dollars of fiat currency, so therefore I entrust it to the bank and I take their credit instrument as my base layer money. And you could say that what youve got is two fundamental shortcomings here that cause these two systems to break. One is (1): the base layer protocol is defective. You need a base layer protocol where you can take final settlement at any scale. Can you take final settlement of $387? Can you take final settlement of $38 million? Can you take final settlement of $38 billion? Can you take final settlement every day? If you can take final settlement at any scale at any frequency, then the underlying gold standard or fiat standard would have some integrity  at least a modicum. The second problem is (2): theres no application protocol. So theres no way to create a security or derivative or some layer 2 application on top of the layer 1 monetary token. We need the applications, right? The world needs more than just base layer money, like you need credit, or you want yield, or you want to build an insurance contract, or maybe you need to be able to post a security deposit and you need to be able to get the security deposit back, or maybe you want to put something in trust with a multisignature arrangement for 37 years. There are lots of applications that make the world work. But theres no application protocol. So in both cases with gold and fiat, the base layer protocol is defective, and the application protocol is either non-existent or defective. And what makes Bitcoin special, and what makes it digital money is: Bitcoin gives you a base layer protocol to take final settlement, and it gives you an application-level protocol too. We could debate back and forth, right? Is the application protocol on the base chain  the blockchain? If so, its a Bitcoin transfer. Or is the application protocol on Lightning? You know, using a layer 2. Either of those could be viewed as an application protocol.", "image": null}

So I think the core  and this is so critical  if people can understand this, the antifragility of the world economy is dependent on this simple fact: if we can have higher frequency final settlement, we can have more verifiability in the economic structure, which means less corruption and less blow ups. Whereas the fiat system right now is the complete reverse of that: very low frequency final settlement, very low verifiability, tons of corruption, lots of blow ups.", "image": null}

Every single second, gravity is testing your structure and testing your orientation. Theres that phrase, Can you defy gravity? And the answer is: Maybe if youre a great athlete  for a second or two, right? For a very short period of time can you defy gravity. It requires extraordinary strength, extraordinary agility, and it still comes at great peril. You could try to do a backflip and you can land on your head and you can break your back and youll be dead or paralyzed for life within a couple of seconds. So there is a final settlement. If youre considering a crypto-asset network like Bitcoin  and Bitcoin is the greatest, maybe the only successful example but certainly the greatest example of a crypto-asset network  the frequency parameter and the block size parameter for a crypto-asset network is the equivalent to the space-time constants in a universe. So the 10-minute frequency, thats how fast the universe evolves. And the block size is the gravitational content, what is the relationship between mass and energy and how tightly packed is matter? And once youve established those two constants, youve defined the constants that run the universe. Everything else evolves around those two constants. This is why you would never want to change them, because changing them is playing God. And you only get to play God once. When you start the universe, if you change the frequency and the block size of Bitcoin, you invalidate all work thats come before, you imperil all structures that have formed in the universe since the beginning of time, you impair every mechanism thats been created within that set of structures  you impair them and maybe break them  and you throw the future into chaos. All of those things. I mean it couldnt be clearer to me, but if you want the physical metaphor its like, What if I triple gravity on the surface of the Earth right now? If I could snap my fingers and triple gravity? How many pieces of furniture do you have that crumple? How many chairs collapse? How many peoples hearts stop? How many ships sink? How many planes fly? How many factories keep working? Stuff breaks  not just factories start breaking, buildings start collapsing, bridges collapse, tires deflate. The person that worked for 100 years to create that great company or the Rockefeller Center and it just crumbles? So you worked for 100 years and you did something and it was beautiful until everybodys dead. What happened? Well you changed the gravitational constant, you changed the space-time constant, and therefore the structure which had been carefully constructed since all of eternity forward, the structure is now rendered null and void and it collapses. Ships are designed based on the Reynolds number. Theres something called a hull speed. And the hull speed is a function of the shape of the hull, and thats a function of the way that fluid flows. These are basic constants. And no matter how fast you push that hull, it wont go any faster because the water pushes back as hard as you push it. Thats why a 150-foot vessel thats 30-feet wide will cruise it 12.5 or 13 knots and it doesnt matter the horsepower of the engine in it. Its just the way that the world works. Another example of that is shock-waves and the speed of sound. Theres a reason for the speed of sound  I mean, its a its a fundamental constant. You go faster than the speed of sound, then youre moving faster than the air can move out of the way? You get a shock-wave. Lots of devastation. What happens if you change the speed of sound? What if you changed the speed of light?", "image": null}

If the Bitcoin mining collapses, the energy usage collapses. If the security collapses, the network collapses. You know whats going on with some of the proof of stakers is: if you flip from proof of work to proof of stake, you destroy your entire mining industry. If you destroy your entire mining industry, all of the security  all the social, political, economic, thermo-dynamic security  collapses. If it collapses, the integrity and the durability of the money collapses. There are all sorts of second-order, third-order, fourth-order consequences to this.

When there were a hundred HODLers it was something, when there was a million it was more immutable, when there was a hundred-million it was more immutable. When the Bitcoin mining spreads further, when the HODLers spread further, when there are more institutions and organizations and jurisdictions HODLing  the more it spreads, the more immutable it gets, and therefore the higher degree of confidence you can have in the integrity of the entire thing. That is whats interesting about this entire phenomenon. Ive described it as a fire in cyberspace, but a better metaphor might very well be a monetary virus in cyberspace.

{"title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 10 | The Death of Gold", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-10-the-death-of-gold-554ddfbea012?source=user_profile---------13-------------------------------", "body": "You know, I never in my life had anybody asked me that question before you asked it to me the first time for our first series? And when you asked me that question, that catalyzed the whole set of thinking. And it got me thinking: money is energy. And of course we did the nine-part series and we spent a lot of time talking about energy systems and engineering as a discipline of manipulating energy and why it was critical to the human race and the human condition. And so we wont re-cover any of that, because thats well-trod territory. But coming back to the question of what is money and just focusing on it, I would say, for our round two or part two of this series, Id say: money is tokenized energy within a socio-political framework. So we know money is energy. But tokenized energy  that is: a dollar is a measure of energy, a gold coin is a measure of energy, a bale of tobacco that youre trading is a token of energy. And how much energy? Well, thats where the socio-political framework comes in. You can you can measure actual physical or engineering energy and its objective, but money ends up being to a certain degree subjective because if I show up on a deserted island and Ive got a stack of gold coins and everybody has guns, and theyre shooting each other, they might not accept my gold coin. Whereas if I actually offer the bullets for their gun, they might think the bullets are actually better money than the gold coin, just like cigarettes are good money and in a POW camp, but gold coins wouldnt be. So this question of what is money gets you really going. So if money is tokenized energy within a social-political framework, then we can look over the history of mankind and we realize that weve chosen many different ways to tokenize that energy, and well skip through most of them because they came and they went, but there are three that popped to mind that are interesting. One is the gold standard. The second is the fiat standard. And the third is the Bitcoin standard. And when you start asking what is money, you start asking, well, whats the best monetary system? And weve got these three systems to talk about. I think one thing thats pretty clear is that most people cant get their heads around Bitcoin because its an utter paradigm shift. And why is it a paradigm shift? Well, because I think Bitcoin is the first digital money. Its the first digital money. Gold wasnt digital money and fiat is not digital money, either. And so economists and politicians and investors, they all lack the right mental model to understand Bitcoin because science and engineering were so intrinsic to gold that we took it for granted, because gold is a 10-pound lump of something and if you if you get slugged in the head with it, nobody had to explain that science and physics mattered. And then science and engineering kind of became like quasi-irrelevant in the fiat world. Everybody just kind of ignored science and engineering and there were no immediate clear consequences. There were just the hyperinflations and the collapses of those fiat systems. But because they abandoned gold and there was no digital money, the only alternative to one fiat, you know, the Weimar Republic fiat currency, was the [British] Pound. And that alternative was an alternative to the next thing and the next thing. So were comparing fiat currencies or fiat monies to each other. And so there was no real need to embrace science and engineering. And Bitcoin is this paradigm shift where we have digital money crashing into, I guess what well call analog money, or maybe a political money is a better way to describe it. And now we start to ask the question again, what is money? And I think tokenized energy isnt good enough to explain what is money. Another way to describe money is by coming back to the ideal model. What is the ideal model of money? Ideal money is a shared, immutable, correct ledger. You know, youve heard the phrase, Bitcoin is a shared immutable ledger and people debate about whether its truly immutable or not, but a crypto-asset network, fully decentralized and mature, is the closest thing we can get to an immutable shared ledger in the history of the world. I think a lot of times when people describe it as a shared immutable ledger, they leave off the correct or the mathematically correct, because its almost implied. But I think that if you were to focus upon the three critical dimensions of ideal money, you would say: (1) its a ledger thats shared, everybody in the political system has to have the same access to the ledger. (2) It has to be immutable, no one can doctor it. But it has to be (3) correct, mathematically complete or mathematically proper, because if its incomplete or incorrect, then its not ideal money. So if I take that as a model, money is a shared immutable, correct ledger, then I can imagine the perfect money would be: some godlike being comes down on earth and they create this perfect uncorruptible system and they telepathically drop that shared immutable correct ledger into the heads of every human being. And every time you incur a debt, it updates the ledger and when you incur a credit, it updates the ledger. And no one can corrupt the ledger.", "image": null}

Can I enter a building? Can I exit? Can I cross a border? What are my rights? And what are my obligations? And what do I own? And what do I share, and it all comes down to just a shared database, but that database needs to be immutable and correct. And that is property, the essence of property. And I suppose, when you own a piece of property, and you buy it  a piece of land five acres somewhere, then theres a deed and you go and you file the deed with the courthouse. And thats kind of critical, right. And so much of property law revolves around making sure that there are no liens on the property before I buy it, making sure that you have the proper title to it. And that you can transfer that title. And I think that money, to your point, its kind of like the apex property, its the sum of all property or at least its the most important property, I suppose, because it would be the property that I could use to trade for any other property. Any other property or any other product or service. So that is my tokenized energy.", "image": null}

Is that money because the most important person in the village said its money? Or is that money because the best engineer offered it as money? Satoshi engineered money. Whereas, every government has created money. So if we start with that model, right: shared immutable correct [money]. And now we go back to all the monetary systems in history. Start with ancient coins, right? Coin networks, well there have been so many coin networks starting with the Lydians. Each coin network is: well I have a gold coin, I have a silver coin, I have a copper coin, oftentimes, theres three different coins, you know, one for 1,000, one for 10, one for 1, they have to be at three different scales. And the shortcoming is you create a system of coinage or custom tokens, and then you start shuffling them around in a network, you can only trade to the extent that you have those tokens. And if people lose the tokens the money is gone. But then people try to counterfeit the tokens, they try to cut the coins different ways. Eventually the coins might wear down, the coins have to be carried. And so why do all these coin systems fail? I guess on one hand, theres never enough of them. Theres always a limit. On the other hand, theyre discrete. So you can go from 1000 to 100 to a 10, or from 1000 to a 10 to a 1 but how do you get to a 0.1 or 0.01 when you want to get to orders of magnitude more or you want to make change in the middle. You end up with all these money changers, and the result of the money changing is a huge amount of friction or impedance. And for thousands of years, people couldnt figure out how to manufacture coins that couldnt be cut or counterfeited or that were durable and so ultimately, every single mercantile system has its own internal coin system. And when you swap from one system to the second, theres this money changer in the middle and they take you for 10%. I remember traveling from London to Rome back before the EU was formed, Robert, and I showed up with dollars, and I converted my dollars into pounds. And then I think I took a plane to the Netherlands and I converted my pounds to whatever the Dutch currency was. And I went to Belgium and I converted the Dutch currency to the Belgian currency. And then we went through France, I converted it again. And then we went to Italy and I converted again, I ended up with like 50% of what I started with after about 72 hours!", "image": null}

And then theres loss over time as people counterfeit the coins, and you cant tell. And then theres losses as the coins get debased. And so the result is what, like 5,000 different systems of coinage over time. And every one of them struggled. Ultimately, they were the basis of the gold standard. And we have this myth that there was a gold standard, the good old days, but it seems like the gold standard never worked as far as we can find anywhere. I mean, we have the stories of the Romans debasing their coinage and the collapse of the Roman Empire. And we know the Lydians eventually lost theirs. And we know there must have been hundreds of systems of coinage in Greece, and one city would sack another city and melt down their coins and create the next set of coins. So I mean theres a problem with the whole idea of coinage. And the problem with coinage is its based on metal  metallic money. And of course, the highest form of money is the gold. So lets say its called the gold standard. But whats the problem with the gold standard? I mean it never worked that well, because its got some crippling flaws, and just some nagging flaws. Theres inflation. Inflation is a nagging defect, it doesnt inflate fast, it inflates slow, but it inflates at 2% or 3% a year. And because its inflating, because youre mining more gold, and youre striking more coins or whatever it is youre moving around, its not conservative. And by that I mean its not mathematically conservative, or its not conservative from a scientific point of view. You start with 100 units, and then youve got 102 units, and then 105 units, and 108 units. So whatever percentage of the gold supply you have is leaking at 2% to 3% a year. And it could be worse if its not a closed system. So if anybody introduces new gold into the system like when the Spaniards found the Inca gold and they brought back the gold from the New World, you get a massive inflation. I think I remember reading a history of Caesar where when he came back after the Gallic Wars, he had seized so much gold that that created a hyperinflation in Rome and the interest rates leaped. And there was just too much money. And so, either there is inflation because you seized gold or another nation flooded your market with gold, or theres inflation because the gold mining process continues. And so against our ideal model of money, that means that golds not mathematically correct. Its not conservative, nor is it correct. Its an approximation. Under the best of circumstances, its got a 2% error a year and so over the course of a decade, the best of circumstances is like a 20%, 25% error rate. But the worst of circumstances is: I double or triple the amount of gold when I come back from sacking the Aztecs or the Incas, or I sacked Gaul and I just brought back all this gold and so then youve just got a massive error. So gold is mathematically erroneous because youre just shuffling metallic tokens and its not a closed system. The second problem with gold is confiscation because its physical. The custodial rights of gold arent really  theyre not great. I guess theyre a little bit better than fiat currency. But in some ways theyre not as good. If I have a lot of gold, if I have a million dollars worth of gold or $10 million worth of gold, its heavy  really heavy. I cant get it through an airport. I dont even know like  you know I tried to  I went online on Amazon once a few years ago and I wanted a little pocket knife. And I ordered this pocket knife  you know how pretty much you can only carry a blade, which is like, I dont know, half an inch long or whats the number? Its like some infinitesimally small sized blade, like a quarter inch or a half an inch blade. So I went on Amazon and I found someone advertising this really super small, dinky little knife that you could use to cut a string with. And it was advertised as being a TSA friendly, compliant little pocket knife. And I was so proud of myself, because I must have paid like $39 for it. And then I took it to the airport to go through the metal detector. And I swear that the TSA agent stopped  you know, I put all this stuff through, they stopped the luggage and said like, Show me that. And they pulled out this little half inch blade to slice a string with, like, Sir, you cant take this with you. And of course the defense of: Amazon said its okay didnt really fly. Right? And the point of the story is, you cant even slip a needle-like metal blade through an airport. I wonder if you could carry five gold coins and get away with it? Or ten gold coins, if you cant get my little pen knife thing through? And so the answer is: its easy to confiscate [gold coins], custodial rights are really weak. The fundamental problem with the gold standard is, the custody is difficult and the security is hyper-expensive. And by hyper-expensive, its  how much does it cost to secure a billion dollars worth of this stuff? Like you hire 24 armed guards and you have a vault in Fort Knox?", "image": null}

And the security cost scales in some ways exponentially with the amount you have. And also with the number of nodes. If I have 100,000 nodes, I have 100,000 points of failure. And so it scales with the number of nodes, the value of the nodes and the velocity of the nodes, or the velocity of the money, right? If I wanted to move a billion dollars of gold every day of the week, for 365 days in a row, 1,000 miles. Figure out the security cost of that, right? The conclusion is, this money is so heavy it has no velocity. It goes into Fort Knox, it sits there for 30 years, and nobody audits it. And under that circumstance you can almost delude yourself into saying its secure. But its only secure because theres no money velocity and theres no distribution. If I wanted to give gold to 8 billion people and wanted to move it every day, then the cost of the security would go up to consume all of the energy that humanity produces, right? Probably the cost of security for 8 billion people moving gold every day is more than the sum of the entire gross national product of the world. So the security cost doesnt work  doesnt scale.", "image": null}

But it has still has this error rate for both inflation, which is relatively small, but the bigger error rate has to do with the violence and confiscation risk, that its unpredictable when the market is going to be flooded, or if youre going to be confiscated, or if your custodian is trustworthy, etc.", "image": null}

Its tokenized energy. And it was the best idea for tokenizing energy in the Bronze Age, I suppose. But its not a [mathematically] correct token. And because its so easy to confiscate, its not really a shared ledger anymore. Its not shared tokens, right? I cant share it because I cant carry it with me. And then that leads us to the third problem with it, which is the hypothecation. Its too easy to counterfeit and manipulate. And its easy to counterfeit because I can either debase the coins themselves, or I can lie about the asset in the vault while I give you a gold note. I either create the gold note and I lie about it or I just debase the coin, and that creates a problem of authenticity. And that leads us to the fourth problem, which is authentication. Its too expensive to audit and authenticate. In fact, out of everybody that I know, I dont know a single person thats ever authenticated a gold coin. You wouldnt know! Coinage was an attempt to make authentication self-evident. Right? And Isaac Newton worked on how do you create a good coin, and most coins were crappy, but we still struggle with this issue. And so if you cant authenticate it, then that really undermines the shared part of the shared ledger as well, and maybe the correct part. And so transportation is also a defect. Its too expensive and slow and difficult and dangerous to move. And distributions a defect because its difficult to move, difficult to authenticate and easy to confiscate. Then that means: how do you distribute it? Its too difficult to distribute, and too expensive to distribute. And when I talk about distribute I mean, how do I give it to a billion people? Right? I mean, practically speaking, if you distribute up to $1,000 of gold coins to a billion people today, there would be a 35% markup/markdown every time it trades, right? You pay $90 for $60 worth of gold. If you have $60 worth of gold, youd be lucky to sell it for $40. And so that transfer cost is obscene. And then finally, youve got this division issue. How do you divide a one ounce gold coin? You cant. And so I cant divide it. So I have to create silver coin and copper coin. And now I never have the right combination of change. So prices dont work quite right. So gold has  fundamentally, its the best tokenized energy in the Bronze Age. But because of all of these defects, by the Middle Ages it was clear it was going to be replaced with some some type of fiat or some kind of checking system or other paper ledger system. Its not clear to me that they didnt replace it  I talked about the gold myth  its not clear to me they didnt replace the 2,000 years ago. Like they talk about the Sumerian tablets, right, and the Sumerian tablets of clay  they have ledgers on them. So, isnt it quite possible, if not likely, that we had checking systems or ledger systems that were privately enforced by banks thousands and thousands of years ago. So the gold myth is: there never was a gold standard. There was never a time when all money was gold. What you had was a time when the principal asset for a store of value over the long duration was gold. And its quite likely that you always had  you know, the merchant had their ledger and you would have credit with the merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the ancient Roman merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the town. Or maybe that was a credit  if you were on a ship, anybody thats ever been on a ship sailing for months at a time, the quartermaster has all the supplies. And if you wanted some of those cigarettes or some of that alcohol, they might let you sign it out, but then they charge your account. And when the voyage is over, they debit it against your wages. And so this has been going on for as long as people have been sailing ships around. What we have is the myth of the gold standard, but weve always had an asset currency system, and the currency was a checking system with a central counter-party  we can call them banks today. But we had goldsmiths that had gold notes back in the Middle Ages. And I think youve always had merchants, and youve always had quartermasters. And youve always had the guy in the army that said, You lose it, were going to dock your wages for that, whatever it is you lost or you spent or you consumed.", "image": null}

But it can only be used for large transactions, essentially, because the economics dont make sense to use it for small transactions. So it doesnt circulate well but you can settle large transactions with it. So due to that technological limitation of gold  effectively it had such a high value to weight [ratio], I guess you might say  that we needed these cheaper systems, these credit systems or derivative systems  systems of deferred settlement built up around it. And that has been kind of the problem throughout history, because we have this system for final settlement, but we build systems of deferred settlement around it, which are economically more efficient. But they introduce all of this need to trust counter-parties, which comes with counter-party risk which blows up time and time again.", "image": null}

The implication is city-state, because I have to get my credit from the local merchant. So if the local merchant is 1,000 miles away, the credit system doesnt work. It breaks down. So I think you can create a trust network that goes about 10 miles or 20 miles  a trust network out to the suburbs. And then once you get beyond the suburbs, the trust breaks down. And if the trust breaks down, that means youve got Renaissance Italy, with 100 different city-states and theyve all got their own little system of trust and ledgers and coinage. And there is no universal money. And so you cant have an easy rise of the nation-state under a gold standard or a coinage standard, or at least its kind of challenging!", "image": null}

And if you have a better money, you have a better economy. And as the money gets  if we come back to this issue of: Is it shared? Is it immutable? Is it correct? The greater the sharing, the greater the economy. The more immutable, the higher integrity. The higher the efficiency of the economy, the more correct. The more effective the economy, the faster the network updates, the faster the economy. So just finishing up on gold  why does gold fail? In theory  why does gold fail in theory? It fails because the base layer protocol is okay. Its kind of God-given by nature. Its the creation and the smelting of gold. Its okay, but its not conservative. The base layer protocol is not conservative. The application level protocol  that one layer above the base layer, the layer 2  the application protocol is difficult and dangerous. But what does that mean? Like so I give you 10 blocks of gold. Thats the base layer. Okay, well, so what are all the applications of gold? What can you do with it? How many people do you know that can actually refine or melt down molten gold and create something with it? Thats the dangerous part and the difficult part. So gold applications, theyre difficult and theyre limited by the laws of physics. And that just means that  and there is no application protocol. So if I want to do anything with gold above the layer 1 its either a very difficult, dangerous application like gold goblets or gold coins or something like that, or I have to create the equivalent of a gold [paper] check, which is a manually implemented protocol. And now weve got the same problems we have with a fiat currency. At the point you implement a gold check, youve in essence moved on to the Fiat standard with a gold reserve of some sort. So gold fails primarily because theres no good application protocol. Its not conservative, its too difficult, too slow, too dangerous. And the physicality of it invites violence. I can literally firebomb the city, kill everybody in it, and the gold wont be damaged. And so when in doubt, shoot first, and then sift through your clothing and take your gold! I dont have to worry about any collateral damage. The last thing in the world you want to do is be carrying around immutable money on your person. When someone has an incentive just to kill the people and take the money. So thats the fundamental problem with gold. Thats why the gold standard ultimately has always just been an invitation to war. And never-ending. I think thousands and thousands and thousands of wars  many wars, right? And an invitation to criminality and an invitation to violence. If the criminals dont take your gold then the counter-parties take your gold and the counter-parties dont take your gold then your own government takes your gold and your own government doesnt take your gold the hostile government takes your gold. But ultimately, gold  because of its physicality  is imperfect property. It is imperfect property. And its imperfect money, because the token itself is so cumbersome and unwieldy to utilize.", "image": null}

I could give you 5,000 accounts of: we sacked the city, we burned it and we took their gold. We might have sacked the city and hauled the people off in slavery. We might have taken their livestock, we prefer to take  normally the livestock is all dead by the time we take the city though. So the people are dead, the cattle are dead, the food is gone, the water is all gone, but the gold is still there! So generally, if you look at the first 5,000 years, its: we sacked the city, we took the gold. Then even in the modern era from 1700, 1800, 1900: We sacked the city. Okay, what do we make off with? Theres not that many diamonds  normally theyre not easy to find. Theres not a lot of that. Sometimes, you know, the Nazis took the art, right? And the Nazi took the gold. And so theres a lot of that: we took the gold from the Treasury, Stalin seized the gold during the Spanish Civil War, and the Poles had to smuggle their gold away to keep it from the Nazis. And theres all sorts of examples of somebody sacking some city or rolling over someones border to take their gold. Thats because its take-able, right? Its like, why do you want to take it? Because its take-able. But not a single example [for paper currencies]. Like the Nazis didnt want Norwegian paper currency. They didnt want Swiss paper currency, they didnt want the Dutch or the French paper currency. And not many people ask the question, Why? We didnt take their checks. We didnt take their securities. Because at the end of the day, securities and derivatives and all these things have no value. Maybe the factory has value. If its not destroyed. Maybe the people have value if you get them to work for you. The gold has value but the paper doesnt.", "image": null}

But it doesnt get reported a lot in political history or even military history. I mean some nations successfully did it to the US but we dont want to talk about it, right? So you wont read that much but its an effective thing you could do. Well anyway, that ends my thoughts on gold. Its basically a metallic token, and it was our best idea, but it seems to have stopped working thousands of years ago. You could say 2,000 years ago almost certainly they had shared ledgers. And they just used gold as a method of final settlement. And we know that it failed at different points. We know that it was debased and resulted in the collapse of the Roman Empire. And so if Rome was the greatest empire on Earth, when their final settlement network failed, then the empire collapsed and what you have is: history is the endless succession of successive empires rising up with the new gold standard that was not debased, and then generation after generation the coinage of that next empire  the successor empire  would be debased, and then that empire would fail and collapse. And then another empire would come along and they would start the cycle over and over again. And yet the myth of gold as immutable money or the sovereign store of value  it stayed with us for thousands of years into the 20th century. I would say that the gold standard has been dying a slow death  a death by a thousand cuts. 1914 comes along  you know weve got the golden age from 18701914 but then World War I comes along and then in 1914 every country abandons the gold standard. And maybe thats the final cut. And after World War I, the Treaty of Genoa, we came back to a gold reserve standard and in essence we had gold backing the pound and the dollar. And that degree of backing successively slid, so there was a debasement of the pound and the dollar, consistently and gradually. And then of course the pound and the dollar became layer 2 applications if you will, and then every other currency became a layer 3 derivative. And then everything else in the economy was built on those derivatives, so you had basically layers of derivatives of gold that got progressively less backed by tangible energy  or de-nurtured. And that resulted in who knows how many collapses: the Great Depression. Eventually we get World War II which you could say came out of just a bunch of economic collapses like the Weimar Republic. And all the gold ended up getting centralized and seized by the Americans in Fort Knox, and then we wrapped Bretton Woods around it, and Bretton Woods was the second gold reserve standard of the century, except this time just the dollar was the reserve currency, backed some percentage by gold  say 40% or 30% by gold. And then every year thereafter it slid from 40% to 30% to 20%  I shudder to say it must have been less than 10% by 1971. And in 1971 we defaulted on the gold standard. In essence, at that point the gold reserve standard was effectively dead. Gold still has a fiction of being a store of value and an asset, and if youre looking for a non-sovereign store of value between 1971 and the invention of Bitcoin, you couldve gone to gold, I guess you couldve used property like land or commodities, timber rights, oil rights, something like that. And you couldve used art. Theres probably no one king, right? People dabble with, Is silver a store of value? I think the free market went back and forth but its pretty clear that gold kind of died  it started dying if not had died about 10 years ago as far as I can see, when Bitcoin was formed. And if we look at performance in the last 12 months, just for kicks lets just go and look at 12 months of performance. So its quite a day, right? In 12 months Bitcoin is up 240%. Gold is down 9.82%. Over the course of 10 years Bitcoin is up 132% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), gold is 0.94%. The S&P Index is 13.9% over 10 years. 33% over one year. Summary is: gold is not a store of value over the last decade, its something opposite of a store of value. If the S&P is up 33% in 12 months, then a reasonable surrogate for the collapse of purchasing power of the currency in 12 months is the inverse of that, right? But you could say you need 33.7% more money to buy the same share of the S&P. So a store of value has to clock at 33% or better, and gold is -40%, and Bitcoin is +200%. So thats the marketplace screaming at you that no-one really sees gold as a monetary asset anymore except for the gold bugs.", "image": null}

Yeah in hindsight, reflecting back on it, Ive always been anti-establishment, anti-authority, not to say that I was a troubled kid. I pretty much was able to maneuver my way by being bad enough that I could have some fun and that kind of thing, but maintaining good enough relationships with older people that I could always smooth it over. But that was always my sense, and I was always a curious kid, and I was fortunate as a youngster to have exposure to a lot of unique individuals, both through travel and through my dads occupation and the people he came across. And so I say that only to kind of speculate where or why is it that any of us are more or less curious? That was kind of an open question  I dont have an answer to that. But as I grew up, money was something that I recognized as giving you access to the world. Increasing your optionality I guess would be the terminology wed use today in Bitcoin that you hear a lot! And I also saw the stresses that money placed on my family growing up, and I didnt want those! I wanted to be free of those! And so I was focused on making  you know, when I was younger I just wanted to be as rich as possible. But simultaneously  and totally unintentionallywas just, this is the only definable moment I can really say that it really took flight for me. Because I think were all just in the world trying to figure it out, so we all have a certain level of curiosity, of course. But I remember playing with one of the kids on the street when I was 11, 12, and she was my age but she was ahead a year in school. And I was like, What the fuck? I hate school! How are you getting out a year before me? And she was like, Well I just read a lot! And I was like, What the fuck do you mean  read a lot? That doesnt have anything to do with what we do in school, does it? And she was like, Well, I dunno! School was just easier for me as a result, so they bumped me up! And so I never got bumped up in school, but I took that as  that kind of set my mind on fire and I was like, This reading thing must have something to it! [05:18] And so I went back to my dads bookshelf that day and picked out a book, and I still remember the book it was! It was Hidden Power: Unleashing the Power of Your Subconscious Mind, which was quite an interesting book to start with! Because Id never considered even the influence of my subconscious mind till then. And so it was kind of revelatory to me, really, and it probably served as a bit more of a foundation than Ive ever given it credit to subsequent to reading it. Anyways, I started reading a lot and really enjoyed that, and read all the classic Buffett and Graham investing books when I was in high school because I thought, You know, the way to be rich is to work your money! You dont want to be a wage slave  you want to basically make money by rent-seeking of other peoples money! So thats what the plan was in high school. And I did a rotary exchange after high school  I was in Japan for a year. And it was probably around that time that I realized that China was the future. I think that was 20045. Id done a lot of reading about China with all the books available at the time, and it was very clear to me that the 21st Century was gonna be Chinas century, as the US was the 20th Century and the UK was for the 19th Century and so on. And Shanghai was the New York, and so I thought  I actually didnt want to go to university, I wanted to actually leave high school at grade 11 and just go!  but I was corralled out of those decisions. In hindsight, unfortunate, but heigh-ho! And so after I finished university, I went down to South America and spent 34 months there. Part of that was exploring Ayahuasca and learning about that, and another part was partying a little bit too much and traveling around and backpacking and that sort of thing. And thento answer your question  there was no trepidation or it wasnt a very well thought-out thing, I just said, Shanghai is the New York of the 21st Century, thats where I wanna be! So I booked a one way ticket and I booked a few nights at a hostel and I said, Ill figure it out, you know! So I flew home from South America, switched out my bags, filled out my backpack with a few different items and booked a one way ticket to Shanghai. I mean I wanted a job in finance, I put my resume around, didnt get anything, and then Im a die-hard UFC fan, a guy on a forum said, Were watching the fights at a bar one night, I end up going to the bar, sitting next to that guy and he ends up being HR for the biggest ex-pat wealth manager at the time, and so I got an interview, got a job, and worked in that capacity for a few years. And all the while during university I had started to change my tune about the principle aim in life being wealth accumulation, and that coincided with exploring the psychedelic realms, or lets say different aspects of consciousness via certain psychedelic substances. And you know that leaves an indelible mark on you! Its really difficult to have those experiences and not be changed, and I think a current of change was already happening in me but that certainly accelerated it. And so it took a little bit of the hunger and edge and whoop-ass and take names of my intent of going to Shanghai  so when I found myself in the wealth management industry, (1) I was a bit disillusioned because I thought it would be a little bit more sincere in terms of what the role of an asset manager is, but youre a glorified salesperson and youre told to sell, sell, sell, basically. And thats the same pretty much everywhere. And so I ended up not liking the industry, not liking the job, but still wanting to be in China because you know this is where the Bitcoin narrative kind of has really impacted my life is: I hate to say this, but my initial years in China I kind of lost myself, which is weird for me to say because Ive always been someone who took care of my health and took care of my intellect and tried to learn and tried to grow and tried to continue develop myself and not be wrapped up in a lot of the things that people get wrapped up in, whether they be substance abuse or bad lifestyle habits or bad relationships or all that kind of stuff. [10:05] But my assessment of the world at the time from having consumed a ton of resources about anything I could find about every industry and how it all worked  we all try to piece together the world in our own ways and thats what I tried to do. And I wasnt left with a great impression in terms of what was in store for the world. And so once the kick-ass nature of my desire to go to China and work in Finance dissolved away, I was a little bit left with  a bit aimless is I guess the way to put it! So I probably didnt treat myself as well as I should have during that time, but I still felt that China was the place to be: I still thought it was the future and I thought there was opportunity there, and I loved the energy there. I mean Shanghai is a modern city and theres a great ex-pat population and the young local people are awesome. Its a really great place to live, if you can handle the pollution. I stayed there and I ended up going back to school for 3 years and I studied natural medicine and then I worked in that capacity in Shanghai also. But I guess it was in 2014 I came across Bitcoin, or finally got in. And then in 2015 I interviewed Bobby Lee who at the time was the head of BTCC which was one of the longest-running Bitcoin exchanges in the world and he was kind of a central figure or popular figure in the mix of Bitcoin. And that really started turning my perspective around, becauseas is so often the case these days when you hear anyone talk about Bitcoin, and I think Saylor has done a great job amplifying that message  is: Bitcoin is hope! Bitcoin represents so much hope for the future, because it remedies so many of the fundamental issues that plague society and culture and markets and economies today. And that started to dawn on me. And like I think is the case for everybody, you go down the rabbit hole and you say, This is interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Wow! This is really interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Holy shit! And then you go a little further and you find yourself obsessed and not able to really think or do anything else beyond the obligations that you have! And thats kind of what happened with me. And so I left China in mid-2018, I went down to Thailand and ended up meeting someone there and we just basically have stayed there for over a year. And I find myself stuck in Canada at the moment with the COVID nonsense thats going on. Thats the closed-notes version of the story. But I think the more relevant point, because that may have been boring to some, what Bitcoin has done for me is  I mean it dramatically reorients many things in your perspective  but I kind of thought that like it was a fait accompli that China was gonna take over the world, and it probably still is even if everyones on a fair playing field. Lets say its a Bitcoin standard everywhere, I think thats probably still going to be the case! But because of Bitcoin, its kind of reinvigorated everywhere else in the world, and Bitcoin is everywhere, right? And so I can get my rocks off about being at the vanguard of a momentous shift, and one thatfar more the case in Bitcoin than in China  is representative of an extremely positive change, I can be involved in that anywhere. And so part of the reason why I was in Shanghai was I just didnt want to miss out on it! I thought this was like a massive historical shift and I kind of wanted to be at the center of it! I wanted to be in New York at the turn of the 20th Century, or early 1900s, right? And now I dont so much feel that pull, because I think the big storythe macro narrative of our time  is definitely Bitcoin now. And Bitcoin is such that you can be involved in it anywhere! So now its sort of re-framed in my mind that the most important thing, and the thing that I most focus on, is maximizing sovereignty and freedom. How can I construct my life so that I have the highest degree of optionality and freedom to live the life I want to with my friends and family and loved ones and all that kind of stuff, and thats the big story that I think is unfolding for a lot of Bitcoiners right now.", "image": null}

Theres lots to unpack there that I want to get into. One of the things you said, I think in the Cosmic Deep Dive, is before Bitcoin, the external world caused you to withdraw, and that there were bright and dark spots then. And I really related to that in the sense that I think in my 20s I really wanted to find Truth and Fairness and Freedom, but I think a lot about this fair side of it, where I didnt think the world was fair, I didnt like a lot of what I was encountering in the external world, and I did withdraw! And I really waffled between whether Im an introvert who built up extroverted skills, or Im an extrovert who just reverted from the world and didnt want to deal with a lot that was coming my way. I didnt feel that I could get ahead fairly. Like you were saying, it seemed that the best way to get ahead was rent-seeking! I remember in college I studied Finance, I learned all the tricks, I learned how really big players made a lot of money. None of it seemed fair to me. I think that was one of the reasons I dreamed  you know growing up I watched things like Family Ties. I wanted to be an investment banker like Alex P. Keaton and by the time I got there I was like, I dont want to spend my life doing that! Sucking  you know, being a parasite! Because I dont think that  I recognized that, while the intellectual capacity of the globe was going to Finance, thats not really what was creating value for the world. You were just moving around digits and monetizing transactions. And so in my 20s I think it made me really think about exploring myself, and I think that was one of the reasons I fell into things like partying or making that kind of lifestyle, where youre looking to be with your friends, youre living for today. And it wasnt until  I think without Bitcoin I had a lot of despair! The world just seemed dark, and it didnt seem like a place you could get ahead unless you worked more than other people at some hamster wheel someone else created, or was a rent-seeker. And that was just not fun! And you just looked for fun elsewhere, and you lived for today, I think. One of the things you said that really stuck with me is that at 11 years old you discovered reading, and you went to your fathers bookshelf and you picked off  Ive never heard of that book but it has a fascinating title for an 11 year old or any age. So Im wondering, Did your parents encourage reading? And what Im getting at there is: Did they encourage curiosity and truth-seeking?", "image": null}

I cant remember  I think it was 11, 12, 13, somewhere around there. But that was definitely the book. No! They didnt! There was no encouragement of that type whatsoever. You know, my parents  I think this is a positive thing: theyve always been very supportive, which, all you can really ask out of parents is love and support. I mean, because who the fuck knows how to bring another human being into the world, right? What are the best ways to treat a fresh mind and mold it and form it into someone whos fit to go out into this crazy world and succeed and be happy? Who the fuck knows how to do that? So I think you gotta default into just saying, Did they love you and did they support you in the best way that they could? And in my case the answer was definitely, Yes! But there wasnt much specific direction of that kind. They werent like, Hey man, you gotta read in order to be smart and successful in the future. They just wanted me to go to school, behave, do well at school, and come home and not cause too much trouble! And thats what I did, but I think maybe why that worked for me is because it just gave me the space to explore on my own and to say like, Nobody is pushing me in one direction or anotherI get to choose! And I chose to  like I said before  I think I benefited from having certain people in my life as a result of both my family and my dads occupation, who in hindsight, I can look back now and say that they were very unique people. And I think for the right type of mind, which was mine, who would be curious about unusual people, I think that fed the flames of my curiosity to say like, Why are those people like that? And what makes them tick? You know, just getting different personalities and looks and types of people  exposure to them when youre younger I think is beneficial because you kind of see that its not a cookie-cutter approach to how people are. People can be a lot of different ways! And theres a lot of different positive attributes and negative attributes that people have. And to see that spectrum when youre young and to perhaps naturally gravitate towards one end of it, like the more curious, unconventional, anti-authoritarian  however you want to characterize it  I think that that was an initial push in that direction, and then my own curiosity just took over and it led to this life!", "image": null}

Was witnessing your parents dealing with money  and Im not really digging into what their money situation was  but just what money is to a family, and Im assuming maybe your parents were really smart, they had smart books in your house, whether they encouraged you to read them or not, and yet money was still an issue. I remember when I was really young, I was probably at 7 or 8, both my parents were public school teachers. And I turned to my dad and I turned to my pop and I said, I want to be a teacher like you! And he kind of grabbed me by the elbow and was like, I worked too hard! Dont ever become a teacher! And he wasnt telling me dont become an educator. I dont think that was the lesson.

I mean, they busted their ass and Im really happy with everything theyve given me, but it was very striking to me that  it was a little bit of a lesson of, Take care of yourself, it felt like!

So its almost like the nominal amount of money probably wasnt the issue. It may very well have been their relationship to money and to wealth and to their spending, and so whatever it was, it was definitely something that was very very seared into my mind, like I dont want to have that kind of stress in my life. Like I can tell that that kind of stress is unhealthy. That type of stressit just isnt good and I didnt want it. So I think that kind of fostered that desire to really go after money, but as a said, you cant help what you really believe. And this is something that you only learn maybe when you get older, or for most people. But you cant fool you. You can fool everybody else for a time, but you cant fool you. And thats the tricky part, and thats the part that requires courage when you come to that  a lot of people have difficult times in their life, and maybe its a crisis moment or maybe its just an accumulation of experience where you say like, I gotta just step up and do what feels right and true to me. Not to anybody else, not for any other reason than, This is actually who I currently am, and this is the journey that Im on, and the place in that journey that Im at. And you know, thats difficult! And one of the things that gets me so excited about Bitcoin is that a big impediment to people being actually able to do that is the financial concern, right? Like I have to be Lawyer John because every day I go and be Lawyer John  if Im anything other than Lawyer John I cant put food on the table, I cant pay my bills, I cant support my family, whatever it is. But Bitcoin is providing a very very very unique opportunity I think for people to put themselves in a situation where the financial concerns are becoming less and less and ultimately, hopefully, no impediment to them expressing who they truly are! Im not saying that its super easy. I mean a big part of my development and all the traveling and escapades that I went on was trying to figure out and refine what exactly that was. And trying to explore. We talk about looking out on the world and being a bit concerned with how it looked and not very motivated to pushing to the future  that despair that you mentioned. And you know, a big part of my searching  traveling and trying different experiences and stuff  was kind of me saying, Surely theres more than this! Like once you put together a piece of the world and you see maybe it doesnt look so good to you, you come away with like, Surely theres more! And I kept just following that impulse and I refused to believe that there was no answer to that question. [25:25] I maintained the belief that surely there was! Again Im not saying that its easy to do but I think a lot of people who are set free financially by being involved in Bitcoin now and into the future, I think the degree of sovereignty that permits is going to allow them to have the choice to actually become or be or express who they genuinely are, and I think thats of huge benefit to the world and of course its of massive benefit to the individual, because theres nothing worse than having to act in a manner that is not genuine. Having to be someone who youre not. And that characterizes probably most people in the world today, and Im really excited for more and more people being able to step out of that faade and start to explore and express who they really are!", "image": null}

I can relate to a lot of that! I wonder how much watching our parents  like my parents were hardworking people. My father even had a second job working at flea markets and kind of just trying to provide more. I dont know how much what we saw was their relationship to money as to inflation. Because they were doing what they were supposed to do and it was still a struggle to do and accomplish all the things that we wanted or needed. And I use wanted and needed interchangeably there but I know the difference. But its interesting you told a particularly interesting anecdote on the Cosmic Deep Dive about  and I think it relates to what you were talking about with genuineness  where you came home and you were out drinking with your friends, and instead of telling your parents you were having having snacks with Johnny and Tommy, you were like, This is what I did, Im a little tired right now, and we can deal with this later. And in that reference point what struck me was you were like, Im about truth, and if I lie to this important people, all Im doing is forking reality. And I thought that was a really interesting concept. I also wonder how much  have you always been a wanderer and are you still a wanderer? Or do you think you were searching for something and you might have found it? I dont want to put words in your mouth, but do you still feel that wandering spirit?", "image": null}
{"title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-bitcoin-matrix-podcast-john-vallis-bullish-on-bitcoiners-fdc255edcd98?source=user_profile---------14-------------------------------", "body": "John Vallis [27:46]: Right. So that story is true, and you said it perfectly! I cant remember how I articulated it at the Cosmic Deep Dive, but Ive always felt that way. I always had a reverence for truth, and Im sure its a little bit more complex, but the most simplest way that it manifested in my mind was, If I dont tell the truth, then Ive created a false reality. Right? Both for myself and the person whom Im lying to. And Ive always had such a burning curiosity and desire to understand reality. I mean this is what all this searching is about, and this is what going into the jungle and spending time with psychedelic brews and that kind of stuff is all about. Its like trying to figure out what is really going on here! And it was repugnant to me to be complicit in the creation of illusion, and to fostering more false reality than I already perceived there was  even at that young age! So thats why I always did my best to tell the truth, even if it landed me in the hot water sometimes. Now in that particular case it wasnt that hard because I was already caught red-handed. [28:58] Like, I might as well own up to it because I wasnt getting out of it! But that has always been definitely something that  not necessarily intentionally  I just always felt really uncomfortable to do anything but [tell the truth]. And to the second part: definitely a lot of wandering, for that very reason! But Bitcoin has grounded me, in a way. Its also caused a lot of my previous interests and education and knowledge acquisition or whatever you want to call all of that, to converge on something that seems to be able to house all of those interests and all of that knowledge, and really give it a gravity and really make it relevant. So in a way I think the wandering has maybe been exacerbated, but its been far more focused, right? Like I dont have to tell you the Bitcoin rabbit hole is very deep and so I dont feel like Im consuming less information these days and I dont feel like Im contemplating what I know and trying to recognize patterns any less. If anything I think its more, because Bitcoin kind of forces you to do that, but its grounding in that Im no longer searching for the thing, you know? My universe of really meaningful things  Im happy where that is right now! I think Bitcoin is  well not that it was ever going to be, because it didnt exist at the beginning of this journey  but to me it represents a tool that can dissolve a lot of that despair that I previously felt, away. It can restructure and reorient both individuals and as a result of that, the structures and institutions that we see in society. And then once you begin to explore that relationship a bit more, you start to be not just relieved but excited, because you understand the relationship between the money and the individual and the culture. And that I think makes us all excited, and this term The Bitcoin Renaissance that we all often use I think comes from a recognition that this can be the foundation for something amazing, incredible, extraordinary! And so why not feed into that? Why not give that your energy? Your intellectual energy, your financial energy, whatever. Like, how could you not, basically is where Im at! And I love that, because in my search for meaning before, the psychedelic realms were probably it, right? Taking care of your body and being healthy and all that kind of stuff, but the apex was just the mystery of the psychedelic state of consciousness. Like, what is that? And even though we cant answer that question, you could tell that it was extremely personal, extremely beneficial experience, and thats kind of why I kept going back to that well. But, its almost like its imbalanced if you only derive meaning  not to say only derive meaning from that realm, but to hold that realm or that experience up as like the apex  I think it leaves a lot to be desired in meat space, in the physical world. Because you can have this Godlike experience, but you come back down and the world still looks the same, like it doesnt change anything, and so my greatest hope prior to Bitcoin was that I always believed the world could change in an instant! Because all that needs to happen is that people need to change their minds, and then wed have a different world. But practically speaking, well thats not very practical! I mean how do you get 8 Billion people just to change their minds on a dime? And it seemed like the forces at work at society, like yes there were bright spots and maybe even their brightness was growing, but there are also big dark spots and that seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle. And Bitcoin has come around and embodied a lot of those principles actually that are represented in the psychedelic realm as well. Of: individual responsibility and individual sovereignty and control over your own domain, and represented that in the physical realm to actually be a tool to foster a lot of those things. To take individuals who are like-minded  and I kind of hate this term but lets say awakened individuals  people that are kind of waking up from the malaise of the cultural conditioning that so many people are subjected to from the time theyre born, and saying, Somethings off here! How can we make it better? I think Bitcoin represents such a great tool to foster that! And so you put those two things together and I feel like were kind of attacking it from both sides, and simultaneously, because of course neither one is restricted to one domain, but of course what I love about Bitcoin and what I love exploring with people that I talk to, is how Bitcoin is changing people! [34:31] And not just their financial circumstances and not just how much optionality they have to move around and that kind of stuff, but like, Why is it affecting what you eat and how you treat your body and who you spend time with? And your aspirations for your family in the future? And the amount of time you spend in nature? And I dont want to cast too wide a net here and I know everyone has a different experience, but those are very common things that crop up, and I think you could put them all under the category of: People are trying to better themselves in more ways than just their bank account. And so theres a lot of overlap there with people that were on the psychedelic pursuit and exploring those realms. I just think its awesome! So I find that they balance each other well, so to answer your question a little bit more succinctly, I think I have stopped wandering a lot! Id love to find a place that valued freedom and sovereignty that was settled already  I dont think that were there yet  but I think hopefully in our lifetimes thatll become clear. And really put down some roots. But otherwise, I cant imagine being involved in anything more exciting right now, so Im pretty sure Im gonna be here for a while.", "image": null}

Its really interesting that you bring up the psychedelic realm and some of the truths or things that that unlocks. I think before Bitcoin I felt that things were fake, the world was fake, I was struggling with that. Was it a huge leap of faith with you to be honest with people about your psychedelic explorations? And Im getting at that more maybe with family but also career-wise? Did you feel that you were putting your career off? At that young age you want to create wealth, you want to seize opportunities, and you also want to  regardless of how you feel about the external world  you kind of have to put out your resume and talk about things.

And this may go back to the, Tell my mom if I could just go to bed and we can deal with this in the morning. To me the trade-off of not expressing how I truly felt about something was never worth it. And thats probably held me back at least financially in my career or in different domains. I cant give you a specific reason why, but Ive never catered to that end. Right? So I think a lot of people cater to the end of climbing the corporate ladder or getting more money or whatever. I always  the highest priority was that nobody felt that I wasnt telling them how I really felt about something, that I wasnt telling the truth. And not even for the other person  thats always been for me! I couldnt put up with being afraid to say something that I actually felt was valuable or that I believed in! The most common place Ive bumped up against this was with my parents, because I always felt like I was never crazy. I always felt like I could logically justify and articulate why it is I was pursuing what I was pursuing. And even if those things were unconventional from a mainstream perspective, I still felt like I could justify them. And if you wanted to challenge me on them Id be more than happy to entertain it. But I think my parents and friends and stuff like that figured out early on that you better have your shit together if youre gonna challenge me on certain things, the things that Ive chosen to be vocal about or engaged in. Because I dont do things willy-nilly! Like, I didnt just go down to  to use an obvious example  like my mom was terrified when I told her at 20 or 21 that I was gonna go down to the rainforest for 34 months and take the most powerful psychedelic known to man and live in a hut with a shaman. Like, you know, for some moms thats a bit worrying!", "image": null}

I really want to touch on what you said about, Bitcoin is a tool. And when you put it that way it almost demystifies it for me in some regards. When I first heard that, it was sort of mystifying. But now its demystifying  its just a tool! You know, you can take a hammer, you could build or you could destroy. And when you put it in that framework, do you think Bitcoin is revelatory, or its just something that we found in nature and we wanted it and now its here? At some point when Bitcoin is just money, the conversations that weve been having around money dwindle a bit. Youve still gotta educate people about money, saving for their future and stuff, but its not so big a deal anymore! Its just the thing we use! And so in that regard, do you think Bitcoin is a revelation, or just something that weve been waiting for and now its here?", "image": null}

I would say that first on a very basic level, we wont be talking about Bitcoin in 50100 years. Because itll be so fundamental and foundational to the culture and society at that time that its not novel anymore. People dont really talk about the Internet broadly anymore as they did maybe in the early 90s. Any tool, I guess we value any tool, maybe even revere tools, dependent upon what they permit! What are the possibilities that the tool represents? And to that degree we revere them. And I think whats happening now is a lot of people that think about this deeply are starting to realize that this tool  like everything, all technologys a tool  everything outside of our physical bodies that we want to use to take action in the world is a tool, right? And I just think whats happening now is a lot of people are starting to understand what this tool represents for possibility now and into the future. What kind of novel possibilities for action does this tool represent? And I think thats why the rabbit hole is so deep, and thats why understanding money is so deep, because when you understand what we use money for and how its evolved in the history of money and that kind of stuff, and its implications and the relationship that individuals have with it and how it fosters the culture and the society that gets built on top of it. I think what were realizing is that this tool represents a dramatically positive shift in how we relate to one another economically and then of course as a collective where things grow on top of that. So on that level maybe its just a tool, but everything speaks to us as more than just what it is. Theres an affect to everything. You may just say value is subjective, so this acorn here thats on my table now, its kind of worthless to me, its nothing. But to other people they might really like it, so whats going on there when people really value something, like what it means to them is a pretty tricky and deep question, but I think what Bitcoins gonna end up doing is allowing us to explore further ourselves about what the potential for human action and human coordination and cooperation is, and what can result from new and novel methods of interacting. And that may sound boring or mechanical, but I dont think it is. I mean I think thats what weve been talking about, right? Weve been talking about exploring our own consciousness, exploring the world, trying to tease out who and what we are and what we want to do with this opportunity that we have as being human beings on Earth, and a tool like this dramatically expands those things on many different levels and domains, and that is a deeply deeply meaningful thing and I think thats part of the reason why its being treated with such reverence by the hardcores right now.", "image": null}

And something else you said earlier on one of those podcasts was that Bitcoin self-selects. And Im kind of curious how maybe Bitcoin changed your behavior, because I find that you were  like my parents and maybe myself  Bitcoiners before Bitcoin! Like, trying to find that fair world. Trying to match your internal with your externalities. Trying to find that stasis or that peaceful dynamic. So Im kind of curious how that changed your behavior. And you said something very early on in the show that you interviewed Bobby Lee. And I remember Bobby Lee as a heightened character in the earlier Bitcoin days, so that was a get! That was someone important to talk to at that time. He was prominent. But up until that point where you were talking, interviewing wasnt a part of your job-set per se. You were working, you came across Bitcoin, but now all of a sudden you were interviewing someone! Im kind of curious a little bit about that moment and how you came to change from just learning about Bitcoin to actually interviewing someone and thinking that that was something that  I dont know why you thought that would bring you benefit  Im not saying it doesnt! I interview people, it brings me tremendous benefit. But how you came to that notion that you should, could, would interview someone, and how it just changed your behavior personally?", "image": null}

The cliche changes that get bandied around as what Bitcoiners do when they fall down the rabbit hole, many of them had already been integrated I guess into my character and into my life, but you cannot discount the impact and the power of hope. And not even just hope, like I was saying before, like not only that the future doesnt look so dark anymore, but that it looks really really really bright and exciting  I think part of the reason it inspires change is because like if you dont have something drawing you forward, then the relevance of novel information that you encounter on a daily basis and even the radar you have up for your sensitivity to acquiring useful knowledge, is dramatically diminished! Because if you dont see a reason to refine yourself now in order to function better in the future, theres nothing pulling you forward, then youre gonna be kind of numb, your sensitivity is gonna be much less to all the things that you could pick up in your environment that could make you more fit for the future. And I think this was part of the reason why so many people today treat their bodies and their minds really poorly! They consume junk television and Netflix and binge-watch all this stuff, several hours a day they stuff their face full of shitty foods, their consciousness is not sensitive to all the different cues and pieces of information and knowledge in their environment that might go toward making them more fit for the future. And so obviously time preference plays into this, but I just think, when you dont see much on the horizon, theres no real natural impulse to make yourself more fit to take advantage of it. And if you see really not-good stuff on the horizon, youre far more incentivized to kind of ignore the noise of information that you might use, and just get your rocks off now! Just go for sensual pleasure! But if you see hope on the horizon, then it shines a spotlight back, and especially the more you learn about the relationship of money to the structure of society, and when you go down that Bitcoin rabbit hole, you see the potential for what it could create in the future, well then the spotlight comes back on you and says, Are you as ready as you could be to take advantage of that? Because that shits gonna be awesome! Are you ready? Like, are you taking care of yourself enough? Are you cultivating yourself physically, intellectually, spiritually, all these different ways in order to maximize the benefit of that thing that you now see on the horizon? And I think thats part of the reason why a lot of Bitcoiners are inspired to change in the ways that they have, and I think were just at the beginning of this thing, man! This wasnt really a big part of the narrative like 34 years ago. I would say that this whole Bitcoin changes you thing, at least as its talked about today, is like 2 years old! Maybe a little bit longer. But its really amazing how quickly it can take effect, and thats why I like to joke what were all gonna be like at the next halving  thats more than 3 years away! Like, what are we gonna look like then, when people are reporting  you know Ive talked to people that got in on March of 2020 and 6 months later theyre telling me all the different dramatic ways they changed their life in 6 months! I mean what happens when its a year, 2 years, 4 years? So I think thats one of the powerful impacts of hope, is that it actually sensitizes you to interact with your environment as though it had greater meaning, because it now held greater purpose and prospects for a better future, whereas before it didnt. So I feel like thats one of the ways that it really tunes you to just act differently and treat your environment differently. [50:46] What was the second part of that question?", "image": null}

But you know, I want to say my parents were Bitcoiners before Bitcoin: They lived for the future. They always sacrificed today for tomorrow, and they sacrificed themselves for their children. I dont know what their lives were like before us. But I had despair and I think thats why in my 20s I was just seeking pleasure. I wasnt  Im not saying I was all about pleasure in the physical world but I was living for today. And just trying to enhance myself. Like yourself I spent 5 years actually at one of the Big Four accounting firms, and then I left to go on a 3-month journey through the South-Pacific by myself. Really just to chisel out myself and you know theres nothing like  when youre a tourist and youre with people you might go see the Grand Canyon but its like, What do you think? I dont know! What do you think?When youre by yourself its like, I dont have to be here if I dont want to be here. Why am I here? Why am I doing whatever Im doing? Before Bitcoin the external world caused you to withdraw and it would bring dark spots. But one of the things is its like, Now the future is brighter! And you did touch on this thing: In the Western World we have a crisis of diseases of despair. And a lot of times when you hear news or narratives, you dont know if its someones opinion  well its always someones opinion  but some opinions you hold a little bit more closely or value. So when you said something to that effect, it really struck a chord because I see the despair, I dont know if its greater than before! So in my 20s Im wandering but in my 30s I happened to get married, I fell in love, I found my wife, my soul-mate, and I had children. And I kind of had to give the wandering up for them, and give my own despair up for them, and just get it done and not bring it home, and figure out a way to get ahead. And it was a constant scramble, because youre doing the job, youre trying to figure it out, and things are always running away from you. But I had to just buckle down and figure it out! Theres no excuses, right? But when I found Bitcoin, things got a lot brighter, because I had  Im not gonna say a way out  but I had control over my own money in the sense that no one could debase it. Not control like censorability or seizability or any of those things, but like, No ones gonna eff with my money! And that really changed my whole outlook. So Im just curious what your thoughts are on this crisis of despair for people who havent found Bitcoin? And when I say that I dont want to make it sound like Bitcoin is their salvation, as much as it can be for us  again I think the salvation comes from within, and we were looking for Bitcoin, thats why we found it. You said it before: Bitcoin self-selects! Ideas have people, we had that idea in our head for some reason that we needed to find a better way. But what do you make of the despair around the globe and how real or actual or heavy that is?", "image": null}

But I think most people if theyre empathetic enough, if theyre sensitive enough, theyre paying attention enough, they can see that theres a lot of [despair] in the world today. And its covered over in myriad ways and like what I was saying earlier, people dont act like how they truly feel! They act like how people expect them to, and how they need to act to advance their position whether that be familial, corporate, whatever! Whatever games theyre in, theyre acting in the manner that will advance their position in those games. And on that note you could say that fiat currency is creating a perverse meta-game and its creating all these avatars of people that are not acting in accord with who they truly are, but in accord with what the game requires of them. And I think the last year has been really revealing of this. But I try to be empathetic, and I think at a core level were all the same, and I think were born in different locations to different families in different languages and all that kind of stuff, and as a result we appear different, but I dont think theres anything really that separates us on a fundamental level. But people seem to be very confused, I guess is the nicest way to say it! And consumed by fear and not taking it upon themselves to construct their own worldview, but having one imposed on them, and theyre complicit in it, of course. You dont have to go that way! But most people do, and they end up being a shadow of themselves, and they end up being avatars of this extremely perverse system that we have. And look, I dont want to be exclusively critical of this. Like, obviously there are bright moments: We could readily admit that people are conditioned by the mainstream media and the nation state and the fiat currency regime, but when you have a nice moment that [its] your kids birthday, or when you have a beautiful moment with a loved one, or when a family member  you know like there are pockets of pure, genuine joy and experience all over at all times  and to me thats real. Theres nothing intermediating that experience when it happens for real. But thats the exception. Most of the time people kind of withdraw into the conditioned, culturally determined behavior that people have come to believe is the most effective way of maneuvering themselves in this world. And I cant remember who said this quote but I remember as a youngster it always  I said it to myself often, actually, as a way to console myself for being frustrated and also curious why the world seemed so weird to meIts no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society. I want to say it was Krishnamurti but I dont think it was him.", "image": null}

But I cant be sure about that. Anyway, that was a bit of a mantra for me for a time, because I was seeing a lot of what I thought was irrational, crazy behavior around me and wondering why I didnt feel compelled to mimic it or to engage in the same type of behavior. And my assessment was: The society is quite sick! And I didnt at the time know that the huge reason for that was the money, I just knew that that was the case, and mainstream media and government and all the rest  I knew those were all influences. And so that quote and that way of thinking helped me maintain my steadfastness perhaps in not acquiescing and going into that. But to circle back to your question, I think theres a ton of [despair]. I think the system as its structured right now and the siphoning off of wealth surreptitiously from people and also the macro structure of society and culture as a result of being predicated on this unfair monetary system that dominates globally, its definitely exacerbating the propensity to fall into despair. [59:43] And all the different downstream effects  the mental health issues and the substance abuse and the anger and the frustration, and all of these things that are toxic to the individual and to relationships and to society. Obviously theyre all latent within us, but I think it exacerbates them tremendously. And so I think if we wound up on a different monetary standard  one that could not be corrupted, like Bitcoin, one that was fair for everybody I think wed see a lot less of that. And in fact, when I was working in natural health, mind-body medicine or psychophysiology was something I was very interested in, and Ive said this a bunch only half-jokingly and I actually dont consider it a joke at all anymore, but I think for a therapist, someone in a therapeutic setting where theyre dealing with these issues all the time now, I think its critical that you include education about Bitcoin into the therapeutic stack, because understanding  I mean a huge element of despair is looking out at your environment and feeling like it doesnt jive with you. It doesnt make sense, or its overbearing, or theres no hope, or theres no place for you in it, you feel alienated and isolated and all this stuff, I feel like if you understood Bitcoin and what it meant for how the external world might change, that would dramatically change your perception of how well you could integrate with the external world. And I think thats a huge aspect of mental health issues! So I think it should be integrated into the protocol stack, the therapeutic stack for mental health professionals. Were a long way off of that, but I think it should! So I see a lot less despair, mental health issues, on a Bitcoin standard. I know for a fact that its had dramatic impacts on Bitcoiners. Ive talked with Bitcoiners, and theyve said this publicly on shows Ive done with them, that were basically suicidal. Im not gonna dig into the reasons for that, but that was where they were at. And as a result of grokking Bitcoin and starting to see it, their life has completely turned around! Ended up coming out of that and starting a family and being more financially secure and having hope for the future. And this is a huge part, man, that we havent touched on yet, but we talk about Bitcoin as a tool and what kind of affect it has and why it draws out these behaviors and what it means for the future. But one thing that is becoming a more and more clear element of this phenomenon is the people that are communicating with each other, the community thats emerging, the culture thats around this thing! [1:02:44] Like Im starting to think  Number Go Up is hands down the most, what brings people in  but in a world thats increasingly divisive and tumultuous and in conflict and vicious and all of this stuff, I think more and more people are gonna be looking at this community of people that are hopeful for the future, committed to intellectual refinement, and have very strong principles and integrity and are expressing themselves genuinely and also like to have fun, like I think part of the reason why we, you and I and everybody listening to this, feel good about being in Bitcoin is definitely the natural attributes of Bitcoin and what that means for how we can conduct our life, but its also the fact that I can jump on a call with you now and I know that were exactly on the same wavelength! And I can do that and I have done that with hundreds of other Bitcoiners! You know, I do a lot of calls that are not broadcast, and it just amazes me that every time I jump on one its like theres no lag  were immediately running right out of the gate. And going back to that piece about feeling isolated  you on your journey, me on mine  were kind of looking for meaning and being like, Theres not many people that I feel like I have a connection with, Im just really not jiving with a lot of people. And then to come into this thing and be like, Holy shit! Now theres hundreds if not thousands of people that Im sure when we meet in real life were gonna become friends really quickly, and who are thinking like I do and who are articulating themselves in a manner that I articulate myself and theres so many similarities! And thats so powerful, man! The power of community! And I think thats one of the elements of why theres so much despair, because people are increasingly cut off, but I think thats also why this phenomenon is gonna be so therapeutic for people and draw so many in, because they see this positive culture emerging from this thing and theyre gonna want to be a part of it!", "image": null}

I agree with everything you said and I really recognize that power of community. I dont think Ive felt that at all since maybe college when youre spending a lot of time with people and youre really connect very quickly. I also related a lot to what you said about [being] consumed with fear, and like I said I made a commitment: I have a familyI was gonna get through this thing no matter what! Not through this thing, I am gonna get through this thing no matter what, and Im gonna do everything I can for them. But before Bitcoin I can relate to that lack of control, and youre doing everything you can but there are certain elements  theres this tool, the moneys the tool  the denominator is out of control. But before we turn to the really fun stuff that I want to get into with you, Id love to ask you a little bit about China in the 21st Century  what youve gleaned? You havent been there  I dont know where youve been  but you left living there in 2018 so its about 23 years, but you still seem to have a lot of conviction about where theyre pivoting going forward regardless of what Bitcoin does! And so Im just kind of curious a little bit about what you saw in China and why you had this conviction of them being the leader of the 21st Century? Im not even getting into whether thats good or bad! Just what is it about that that steers you in that direction, that foresight?", "image": null}
{"title": "The Bitcoin Matrix Podcast | John Vallis: Bullish on Bitcoiners", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-bitcoin-matrix-podcast-john-vallis-bullish-on-bitcoiners-fdc255edcd98?source=user_profile---------14-------------------------------", "body": "John Vallis [1:06:16]: Yeah. So any conversation of China is tainted with the bad things, the evil stuff the government gets up to, right? Obviously Im no defender of what they do, but when I first tried to understand the world, one question that comes to anybody who looks at this is like, Why is the US  like in our lifetimes the US has been the dominant global power  why? Thats a pretty obvious question lurking out there. I remember  I think it was in high school, maybe it was a little bit after  but Jared Diamond wrote two books: Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. And he was basically trying to illustrate or explore why the world ended up looking the way it looked. Why does Europe have all the countries that it has? Why is America there and Canada there? And the sovereign individual is probably an extension of that in the 20th and 21th Century, but it basically looks at what are the factors, the technologies, the demographic factors, the geographic factors that lead to the world looking like the way it looks like. And obviously the way the world looks is in constant flux, even though right now it seems pretty set, but I mean if you look at a map of lets say the geographic boundaries of Europe over the last 1,000 years I mean its nothing but fragmentation and consolidation and fragmentation and consolidation and change! Like, thats just what we do! So why are we at where were at right now? And that in addition to China  I love ancient history, and of course its instrumental if you want to understand how the world and humanity has developed. So Ancient Egypt and Ancient Sumeria and the Indus Valley civilizations and Ancient China have always been super interesting to me, and so Chinas always had an extremely rich and extremely ancient culture, and a highly developed one! And they were kind of isolated from the world for a large part of their history, but as far as they were concerned, they were top dog for most of their history. They had the most highly advanced civilization that they knew of, and you could make the case that it was! Ancient Chinese history and Chinese culture pre-20th Century is extremely rich and fascinating. So I just looked at it and said, Look, 1.3 Billion people, the geography and the natural resources to support it. They had a difficult time in the 20th Century, a lot of tumult and changes, but things were coalescing into a more organized and efficient state now. And I remember when I first went there, everyone was like, Ah, theyll never do anything but copy American or European goods  theyre just not the same, theyre a different breed! Im like, What are you talking about? Were all just people responding to our environment! Theres no difference between a Chinese person, an American person, an African person, in what theyre capable of as a human being! Its all just them responding to their environment and their incentives and all that kind of stuff. So to me it was very clear that Chinas story was gonna continue to unfold, and with a population like that and as they became increasingly rich and with the natural resources they had and with a proud legacy of being an advanced dominant civilization in the world prior to the 20th Century, I just felt like that was gonna be the natural order of things! Ultimately I know in the current geopolitical dynamic you may say like, Yeah but the US military is like way way bigger! Its like, Yeah, well, so is the Spanish military and the Portuguese and the British and the fill in the blank, fill in the blank, fill in the blank. They have a billion more people than the US! They have a lot of space for them. They have resources in their own borders and of course theyve been going all over the world buying resources. Theyre extremely hungry and driven and motivated people. There are no more entrepreneurial, capitalist-minded people Ive ever come across in all my travels than Chinese people! And their structure of government is deserving of a lot of criticism especially from a freedom point of view, but one, I think a lot of Bitcoiners would be critical of the state apparatus in many jurisdictions. Its not like ones good, ones bad. Its like degrees of bad that were talking about! [1:11:10] And as far as economic development is concerned, Im a critic of central planning and I think the best way to foster growth and innovation is as an emergent property of free markets, and perhaps their development wouldve been better if they went that way  who knows  but I cant knock the fact that theyve just set the parameters of the game, and then pretty much let the natural entrepreneurial energy of the people play it, and then pour on some gasoline in different areas where they want to see more development. And I think based on that maybe theres bubbles forming, but I think the overarching story is: How could you stop that? And even if we go onto a Bitcoin standard where lets say the playing field is fair and even for all countries in the world  and now the kicker here is the US is getting a massive head start on the world presumably, at least as individuals, because Bitcoin is probably adopted more in the US than most other countries in the world! And thats awesome, because thats gonna be probably a huge determining factor in the future. I also suspect that the PBoC is actually and has been accumulating Bitcoin, but thats pure speculation. Thats my own feeling about how they operate. But if the world is operating on an even playing field and people cant manipulate their currencies and its strictly a matter of who produces the most and best things that the global market wants, I think China wins at that game ultimately! Now one of the things that may influence that that Im really excited about, because I dont like the prospect of any one massive country having a huge asymmetry of power in the world, I think the shift toward  umbrella term  the means of production shifting to a local basis, so with the advent of 3D printing and all the stuff were seeing now: An individual can generate their own power, they can grow their own food, they can make their own tables and chairs. Like, were not there yet but that seems to be the trend that production is coming down to the individual level! And Im sure there will be other things that people end up doing, but Im hoping that that brings the locus of power back to the individual and the efficiency gains of these massive states  these centrally controlled massive states that try to control economies  will diminish, and if thats the case, maybe that influences how the geopolitical winds blow and what changes take place. But if things kind of remain on the current trajectory, I mean I just think people, geography, level of wealth now, organization, I think its just kind of natural that China will be dominant player in the future whether we like it or not!", "image": null}

Like we just simply cant appreciate what the 20th Century was like for mainland Chinese people. Like, fill in your number: 50 Million, 100 Million, dead of starvation under Mao, right? And then the Cultural Revolution where all that stuff about the past  because they felt like the world had become modern and they had lagged behind, and so the Great Leap Forward was basically: Do away with history, all of that tradition, thats holding us back! Weve gotta modernize and move forward! And so they destroyed ancient monuments and they tried to basically destroy the culture so that nobody would be focusing on that, and everyone would be aligned on moving forward. And you know, under that form of communism  and that was horrible, the society at that timeand when I went there in 2009 and probably today in certain pockets but increasingly rare, but when I went there in 2009 you could still see vestiges of like the abject poverty and the kind of toll it took on peoples mentality, to the point that now, still, the cultural mentality of the people is like, its a bit weird! If youre under 40 thats less and less the case, but theres still a generation of people alive today, people that are 40+ that experienced a lot of that stuff. So on the one hand they know that they had this glorious past, this rich culture, but they also know that it was basically shaken out of them! And so now the nation identity  I mean theyre very nationalistic people. Obviously they propagandize and all that kind of stuff, but like, basically they think this is China reascending. And the opportunity is right there in front of em and they want to get after it both for themselves and for the glory of the nation. And so thats how people feel! And for younger people  and to kind of answer the question about how I feel itll shake out  regardless of central planning and government structure and Bitcoin and fiat currency and whatever, the people under 40 that I knew in China, and it was pretty consistent this way, was: I meet them and you could see it in their eyes that theyre curious about the world, right? They want to learn about the world, they want to travel, they want to educate themselves, they want to dress well, they want to kick ass in their chosen field. Like theyre a really well put together people that are focused on  eyes on the prize, right? They know that a better life awaits, they know the opportunity, they want to get after it! Because its been held back from them for so long! Versus, on the Western World, obviously as a result of having had it for so long theres an element of complacency  obviously in varying degrees to different people  and I hate to be too critical of our culture, but a big portion of the culture goes to work so they can come home and watch Netflix and chill out on the sofa until its time to go to bed. Like theres not much drive beyond doing what is necessary to get by! And in China, honestly man, like thats why cities like Shanghai and Beijing and Shenzhen have such a strong energy, because everyone is after it really hard! And thats a tough thing to beat! Like people will work their goddamn asses off! It doesnt matter what the job. Like there is just such a hustle and bustle there! And I dont feel thats gonna stop anytime soon. So I think thatll feed into the economic and geopolitical dynamic that plays out.", "image": null}

Its a great insight! Before we turn to your awesome article, After An Unforgettable Year, Im Most Bullish on Bitcoiners, I really want to bring up another article that youve published on Twitter, it was just a great post. This was on December 16th: Just fuck me already, Bitcoin! John, this broke me! I didnt see it on December 16th, I was researching you, I went down your timeline, this just absolutely floored me. I think this took absolute balls and chutzpah to post! Im a married man, my wife would throw me out of the house if I posted this! But I want to know what you were getting at?

And I mean you know when youre a younger man perhaps and youre doing this traveling around the world, you come across the odd lady and you know theres an element of playfulness and teasing and stuff. And you know maybe weve all been in a situation where like the foreplay is done and you want to get on with it! And I think that Tweet in particular was obviously spoken from the female side of things if were gonna frame it up that way. But no it was like, Bitcoin had been flirting with the all-time high like, Cmon lets go! And whats funny about that Tweet is I dont think it was long after, but things really rocketed up after that one, which is why I think it became kind of a funny Tweet because it seemed like it was speaking to the gods of Bitcoiners, speaking to Satoshi or something like that!", "image": null}

And we shape our tools and we are shaped by our tools. So the story here is the changes in behavior, the changes in the methods and ways in which we interact with one another, and in which we interact with our future selves of course. Thats the story here! Thats the phenomenon! The attention gets placed on Bitcoin obviously because its the novel tool thats emerged to let all this happen, but we are the story here, and the changes that happen in people as a result of this tool emerging and obviously importantly using this tool to maximum effect, to its maximum potential, the effects it has on individuals and the community that it creates  I mean, thats the phenomenon! How could it be any other way? Bitcoin is just a nothingburger if we dont use it and engage with it to actually interact in novel ways. And so thats kind of what I was getting at with that article, and the fact that Ive just been  I guess as a result of that being true or as proof that that is true  Ive had the good fortune to interact with so many Bitcoiners through the podcast and through other means and hearing the stories of genuine transformation! And irregardless of age, sex, creed, nationality, whatever  I often come back to the example of Michael Saylor: It cant just be the fact that people are getting wealthier as a result of owning Bitcoin and the price going up, because heres a guy who was already extremely wealthy, and once he went down the Bitcoin rabbit hole like its very apparent all over his face and his  you know? You can tell that this guy was changed by this thing! I think he was probably  we were discussing before, like  a bit of aimlessness, a bit of despair as a result of thinking, Is this it? Is this all there is, world, that youve got for me? And then having this thing emerge and having the world expand as a result of this thing emerging, right? Our worlds have expanded dramatically as a result of this new tool! And people seem to be changing in dramatic and consistent ways as a result of the emergence of that tool. And going back to that phenomenon of our tools shaping us. And it was also going back to what I was saying about the psychedelic  you know, when I was kind of hanging my hat on the capacity for [the] psychedelic, or the change in consciousness or mindset to change the world, you know there was no real tool to foster that en masse. And with Bitcoin now I think we have one! By whatever means you come in, Number Go Up or the community or sovereignty or protecting from inflation or whatever, I think if you stay with it, like if you pay enough attention to it, it starts to change you! I mean this is the very consistent message in the community: Bitcoin changes you! [1:24:57] And Im so stoked by the type of changes that I see in people! And to a certain degree Ive seen in myself! Thats how the world gets better, is people! Upgrade peopleupgrade the world. We always say, Fix the money, fix the world. But it really is: Upgrade people, upgrade the world, because thats all the world is. Its just us here on this rock. And Ive met so many  I cant say it enough man. Ive had very good fortune to have very good friends and relationships in my life: family and friends and stuff. Ive got a lot of love in my life. But its definitely been the case that Ive always been a bit of a  felt somewhat isolated intellectually lets say. And now to see all these people from all over the world having kind of a simultaneous awakening, and like I was saying earlier  I mean I could just pick up the phone and talk to them like weve known each other for 10 years  kind of like what were doing right now, as a result of the seemingly consistent changes that this thing engenders in people, is nothing short of amazing! So both on a larger macro scale of seeing these positive changes in individuals, but also on a selfish individual scale saying like, Man, the number of people that I feel connected to now has grown exponentially, has exploded as a result of Bitcoin and my involvement in it! And I think thats the case for a lot of Bitcoiners! The connection, again back to that despair component, thats one of the things that make human beings happy, is genuine connection with other human beings! And the fact that Bitcoin is fostering that with like, a lot of other people, is amazing! And I think were just starting to see the effects.", "image": null}

And the instant vibe, and I think that speaks to  I stopped making connections like this when I graduated college. And pre-graduating college my world was guaranteed in terms of I just did what I had to do and everything was paid for in terms of either loans or financial assistance from my parents. And then I was out on my own and the world was running away from me and it was a lot harder to connect to people in an unfair world where no one has time to spend on each other! But like I said before: I think youre the dopest, freshest Bitcoiner in my mind this year. We all have longstanding people that have influenced us and we really relate to or gleaned a lot from, but in this past year of my exploring  especially as a podcaster  theres no one I want to hear more than you! I really enjoy your outlook, especially when  you know I love your podcast  but I love hearing you outside your podcast because I get to hear you!

And we got this new thing up around here now which is Bitcoin Clubhouse. And I have mixed feelings about Bitcoin Clubhouse  not bad  but like I dont think its like going to the opera, its not a polished show, its not a one-on-one, deep heavy conversation, but I like the fire, I like the ephemeral spontaneity, I like the ability to connect. And I think you were in there for the first time yesterday, but I did get to hear you in the Peter Schiff room, and Im not trying to get into the Peter Schiff thing too much, but I just loved hearing you. But I also just really enjoyed your questions to him, and so Ill speak it out a little bit from what I remember, Ill paraphrase. So you asked him, Peter, what would it take for you to understand and/or admit that other people know something you dont? Or understand something you dont? And he gibber-gabbered and didnt really answer that question and I appreciated the fact that you said that that doesnt really answer the question. But I want to know from you, what did you take from that interaction? What did you take from that? Did you enjoy that interaction?", "image": null}

I was just in the audience listening to it all go down. But look, we all feel the same about Peter, right? Hes out of his goddamn mind! Theres no convincing him, clearly! So I didnt want to go in with something like, How can you say intrinsic value? We all know value is subjective! Or something like that, because none of that plays with Peter. So I tried to ask a question that maybe got away from speaking past each other on specific terms and stuff like that. I knew he would do his typical thing and route around it. But I just kind of wanted to hear him admit, and I think he did kind of show his hand, because I said, What would it take for you to  I said something about ego and hubris and if you really want to learn we have to engage in discourse where we genuinely allow for the possibility that the person were speaking with might understand something that we dont? I mean what is the point of the conversation if youre not gonna grant that to the person youre speaking with? And his answer was, Yeah but what is it that I dont know? And I think everyone in the audience  you know? Exactly! That exactly characterizes his entire perspective and his approach to this. I think maybe in hindsight a better question would have been simply like, Have you ever read cover-to-cover a book about Bitcoin? And I think his answer would be No. And I think it would be great to say to him like, Youre speaking from a position of presumed authority on this subject and theres a certain cohort of people that actually value your opinion and are listening to you as if you are educated on the subject, and if you havent even taken any time to educate yourself on the subject when anyone in this space will tell you that it takes a lot of self-education to really come to understand what this thing is  I mean every Bitcoin that I talk to is like, Half my day is trying to continue to try to understand and learn about this thing! And certainly when you first got into it you were probably set on fire and just consumed every resource you could get your hands on. And for you not to do that but still presume to speak from a position of authority is a profound moral failing on your part! And so if I had my time back I maybe wouldve went that route, but I think at this point and for a long time, the only reason why I dont get a ton of enjoyment out of it is because I dont like that people are being misguided by his opinion, but as far as entertainment value, I kind of love that hes around! That hes just this irrational holdout thats kind of never gonna capitulate that we can kind of just use as a punching bag for fun as we march towards hyperbitcoinization. And it makes the process fun. This isnt all serious at the end of the day. No good revolution doesnt have some fun mixed into it, and this is a revolution. And us Bitcoiners gotta get our kick somewhere and I think Peter Schiff is probably one of them!", "image": null}

Theyre sovereign! Like when they are sovereign, you can say what you want and not be afraid of the consequences. But Im hoping that what comes from that among other things is that people will both develop better principles and values internally, and will hold people to account more to  will judge people more on their principles and values rather than just their position or their wealth or whatever. And so I do think we see that in Bitcoin Twitter where sure you can be successful, you can be rich, you can be whatever, but if youre caught being disingenuous, being dishonest, promoting something thats totally self-serving or all these things, people get called out! And I love that! I want to see more of that! And I think Bitcoin is a great tool for that as well because it kind of shines a spotlight on bullshit and I think someone like Peter Schiff  thats kind of why I asked that question  because it is a moral issue that you dont engage in conversation as though the person youre speaking to had anything from which you could learn! Right? To presume that your knowledge is complete  thats a moral failing! And I hope that as we become more sovereign, our lips become looser, but our conviction and our principles and our values become stronger, and we hold people to account more on those variables, not on the typical ones of status and wealth and that kind of stuff. And I see that thats what happens now in the very small Bitcoin Twitter community, and Im hoping that that proliferates further.", "image": null}

I think were a select  not a select few like were special, Im not trying to say were special but were early, is what I mean. And I dont think its permeating as quicklyeven if people make gainswhat this thing is, that its this tool, that it could change their behavior, that it will change their behavior! But I do think that they will be forced to change their behavior, and that it will take a generation and a half. It will take our children and even our children will be subjected to what their parents think of for the last 5 years and the next 5 years. And I dont think everyones coming around very quickly. Most people think of it still as Magic Internet Money, Super Mario coins, its not real. They dont see their dollars shrinking or they get stocks and the stocks go up 20% a year and thats good enough, even though thats keeping up with inflation. I dont have a lot of faith. Again Im an eternal optimist, I think its going to work out! I think we now have the tool to solve this problem for ourselves, but I think its gonna take a long time for it to affect people en masse. But that being said, for me its been eye-opening because I now feel freedom that Ive never felt before! A freedom that comes from being able to grasp something that I couldnt get in my hands before and now I have it. And no one can take it away from me metaphorically  I could lose it, I could spend it, but no one can take it from me! No one could debase it! And thats a really big deal! So now Im an eternal optimist but Im a little bit more inwardly pessimistic about everyone getting on board. But now Im very optimistic for myself  Ive got the keys in my hand!

And I mean I think we all try to manage our expectations on this stuff so that were not disappointed how fast we progress, but I will say that freedom is at first scary and then its intoxicating! And thats been my experience, because freedom is the assumption of responsibility, right? So I think that at first is very scary, people are not used to that. But once you do it and you get comfortable with it, then you just want to do it everywhere. You get addicted to that sense of freedom and sovereignty. So I think thats whats going on. I think once this narrative really breaks through like whats happening in the macro landscape and what Bitcoin represents, I can see scenarios where it happens way quicker than we all might expect. But I do try to remind myself that as is often said in this space, The future is here its just not evenly distributed, but another way I look at it is: Everything is always in flux. There is no stasis. So when I try to imagine a future point in time where the Bitcoin Renaissance is well under way, I try not to look at reality in terms of where we are as a static current moment and where we will be at a static future moment. Like, it will always be underway! There will always be more things were striving for, more things that are changing. And thats just the way it is. So when I think about, When will this happen? When will it be adopted? When will people change? Well the answer is some people  and a growing number of people  are actually having that transformation now! And thats awesome! And look at this great community thats growing up as a result of it. Other people itll take them another 5 years and then theyll come in, another 10 years, another 50 years, you know? So we dont want everything to be the same everywhere at the same time, right? And that could never be the case anyways! And I think thats maybe an outlook that allows you to be a little bit more accepting of the ups and downs and the unexpected things that the flow of time throws at you, because youre kind of like, Im not gonna hang all of my hopes and dreams on some imagined reality coming to pass in the future. Because theres getting there anyways! Ill just be passing through that place if it even happens at all. [1:44:49] Thats why speaking about values and principles and this journey that weve both seen when we were younger of just trying to find ourselves and find meaning and understand the world, I think part of the reason we do that is because we know that theres something inside of us, and perhaps in that realm of things, that can be immutable and unchanging, right? Like, that I know who Im gonna be and the principles that are gonna guide me and the values Im gonna hold, irrespective of the circumstances that surround me! And theres something really liberating about that, because its saying that no matter what happens in the world, no matter what happens in my environment, those things are still my anchor, those are me. And I think thats powerful and in a way that maybe I cant explain right now, but it gives you a sense of comfort maybe about the chaos of the external world, and having a North Star to guide you through all of that. And maybe thats part of the function that religion has served in the past, and maybe thats part of the reason, the motivation behind spiritual seeking and that sort of stuff, but I think thats one of the main benefits of taking the time or being on a continuous journey of self-understanding and refinement, is finding those things about yourself that you kind of know are immutable and unchanging, and using them to give you some level of comfort about the uncertainty of the future and the world around you.", "image": null}

I just want to sound out on you! So Im gonna leave the parting words with you. I agree with everything youve just said, and you know I just want to ask you, Where do you think youre going? Where do you want to be in 20 years? Almost aside from Bitcoin! What would be meaningful to you to accomplish over the next 20 years? Not where you want to start in 20 years. What would be meaningful to you? And that could include Bitcoin of course, but how do you want to spend your time?", "image": null}

I think I have a two-part answer to that: One is, thats a question that I kind of  and maybe we all  obsess over as we go through life, that we want to have some idea of what the future holds and what the best use of our time is and whats gonna make us feel the best about life in general. And I think this has been largely a result of Bitcoin. I dont think I answered earlier when you asked me what specific behaviors have changed in me as a result of Bitcoin, but I think part of it is letting go into kind of a faith that if you can just show up as yourself with your genuine curiosity and not be afraid to speak the truth and connect with like-minded people that you think are good people and you wanna connect with  like if you do that and you have a faith to push into that, then I kind of feel like the result of that is the best you could hope for! So I could say like, Well I want to be the head of a billion-dollar media company in 20 years. But thats just arbitrary! Like, thats just giving an answer. And Im starting to realize that the best thing for me to follow internally is what gives me energy when I do it! What feels right! What aligns with my principles. What do I really enjoy doing? Dont get me wrong, Im just beginning to understand how to interpret that and how to push into it. Because most of my life has been  Ive always been a bit spontaneous, but Ive tried to graft an imagined future onto my life in my past, and I think thats shifting a bit now to just saying, Look, I have a certain degree of freedom. Im really interested in certain things. I just wanna be myself and see what happens, basically! But a bit more of a detailed answer is: I love spending time with people  well Ill paint you my ideal scenario, and thatll probably  a picture says a thousand words. But at some point in the future, Id love to be in a natural environment, whether its rural Canada, rural Mexico, rural Thailand, wherever, just a beautiful environment  mountains, beaches, lakes, rivers, that kind of thing  and have a place thats set up first of all for the things that I love to do. So I love to train Muay Thai and MMA and work out and go for swims and go for hikes and just be active and in nature and that kind of thing, and be with others who are just doing the same, because I love the vibe when youre doing something difficult together and then afterwards you hang out and you talk about how hard it was and the camaraderie there. And have it be an environment where people can come and have these peak experiences that Ive explored in the psychedelic realm. So basically combining health and fitness and wellness with these peak experiences that I think are incredibly beneficial and therapeutic to people. And then micing up and having whatever conversation we like to have! I mean you also asked me earlier why I interviewed Bobby the first time. And the answer is two-fold: One, his office was  I could see his office from my apartment window, it was right across the street. But the other answer is, even at that time it wasnt only Bitcoin-focused, but I was working in Shanghai and I was like, This is not enough! My job is not satisfying me, and the tech industry was really booming there at the time and really getting underway. And I liked that industry because I felt that it was solutions-oriented and it was building solutions to our problems instead of just complaining about things! And I was like, Im gonna reach out to these people and say, How about we record a chat? And thats a weird thing to do, and I got a lot of Nos, but once I got the ball rolling and people realized I wasnt crazy, then I would get referrals from people and say, Do you know anybody else doing interesting stuff? And Bobby I think I hit him up individually and he referred me to some other people. But yeah man like whats better than hanging out with someone and feeling good and then micing up with no time horizon and saying like, What do you want to explore? Lets hit it! Lets go deep in any direction and see what we come up with! And maybe we dont come up with anything novel and just connect, and maybe we do come up with something unique and we both learn something! You know thats kind of the ideal day for me. And of course family and all that kind of stuff, but yeah thats what the vision looks like right now. Well see how it turns out. So I think thats a vague kind of goal, but the guiding force is just, We are all starting to have this opportunity where we really can experience what freedom and sovereignty is, and I think we should take advantage of that by allowing ourselves to be who we are and continue to try to understand what and who that is, and shove it out there in the world and see what happens!", "image": null}

Ive got a question for ya! So I started that [podcast] because like you said I wanted to do an open kind of conversation and then do some rapid-fire questions at the end just to kind of delve into peoples minds, a bit of human interest. And it actually is kind of fun to hear how different people answer rapid-fire questions, although Ive given it up recently because I just more enjoy the open conversations. But lately if Im just having long-form discussions with people, like 2-hour discussions, then a podcast titled Rapid-Fire may be somewhat misleading or confusing! Whats in a name for you?", "image": null}

Im looking to leave all this out of the chat, but like I think that its confusing to me in the sense that  the titles not confusing to me  but the dilemma. Because its like, do I get 30 minutes of this dude and sum it up? Or do I go the full 2-hours? You know? And I would probably put it into two separate channels, just because I dont think that one takes away from the other, but as someone who  I always want to go full-bore. Me personally. And that like Rapid-Fire Im like, Well maybe I could just cheat-code it! So its a dilemma for me. But at the end of the day man I love what youre doing. I love both of em! And I dont care, I mean what do we care? If they want to they will listen to it. And you see the numbers, but like, I like the long form, for me. Because thats just more meaningful for me! And the short form has a purpose, Im not saying it doesnt, but if I see both maybe Ill jump on the short form and skip the long form, I dont know! But dude seriously, I really just want to hear you everywhere! I dont even want to hear you interview people, and I love your interviews. But I love hearing you and what your thoughts are! And I think thats really hard to get that across in an interview because you could share, but I just want to hear you speak. I think that you have a really interesting perspective on this outside of money, you know? Youre on that philosophical bent! What is this doing for us? Because at the end of the day its a tool, and its just a tool! Its maybe the greatest tool weve ever invented, but I dont know, maybe fire is! Maybe the printing press is. Maybe the Internet is. I dont know how its gonna play out over the next 5,000 years, what made one thing more important than the other. I mean you cant have Bitcoin probably without the Internet. But the Internet without Bitcoin is not much the way its gone! So I dont know! But I love hearing you talk about things, I love the way you ask questions, I thought the way you cut into Schiff was gold! Im done with him now! I was done with him for a while, but I was like, Yep after John asked that question, theres no more! Its pointless until hes willing to acknowledge the question youre actually asking! And thats what youre doing all day long! So Im just enamored with you. We didnt get into a lot of things, but you live in Thailand, youre in Newfoundland now, youre from there, you cant get home. Youre a wanderer but youre settling down. I think its wild man, and Im so glad we connected. I really enjoyed our conversation and I just want to hear more from you! Clubhouse is a different animal, because its more talk radio and its more new to experts, and once in a while these experts get into expert conversations about different topics and I love the combination of people there. But at the end of the day its not as fulfilling to me. Its kind of like Reality TV. I could jump in and just waste some time there. I go there to veg out actually. To listen to other people to be entertained. I dont go there to share my thoughts because Im just happy to hear everyone elses! And I was happy to hear you get the opportunity to ask Peter a real question in a live format that he couldnt sidestep without his own words and edit out. So that was dope. So I just want to hear you everywhere, I loved your article in Bitcoin Magazine, I liked your take on things, Im just so happy we got to connect.", "image": null}

You get to dial in with a person or a group of people and you really get to take the conversation somewhere! Like Im doing one with Breedlove and Richard James next week and its looking at Jordan Petersons book Maps of Meaning and were just going to explore that book and relate it to Bitcoin in various degrees, and thats the stuff that I really enjoy! Because like I said about my future, Id love it if that could be part of my day, these intellectual conversations where we kind of ask the big questions and try to foil around and fumble around with them! And try to use each other to help refine them for ourselves. I mean thats what gets me off. So the social media domain is fun and we like to have fun there and banter and other stuff, but I love this and man I couldnt tell you how much I appreciate, one, the work that youre doing  I love your work as well, and also for having me on for this chat, its been awesome!", "image": null}

Today is another deep episode. Were actually getting towards the end of the line here and covering some of the last ground in the macroeconomic domain and tying it back actually to some philosophy towards the end. Today were going to talk a bit about how Bitcoin is an elemental innovation, tying us back to Episode 1 where we discussed Stone Age technologies including Fire, Water, and Missiles. Were making the case that Bitcoin is an elemental invention akin to one of these Stone Age technologies. Which as a reminder if you havent seen those prior episodes I highly recommend you go check those out because they build a long and strong intellectual edifice to get us to this point. Secondly were gonna talk about fiat currency and how its a contaminated form of money that leads to socioeconomic decay. And were gonna go into interest rates, an area thats commonly misunderstood by even people that are typically considered financially sophisticated. Then were gonna talk a bit about central bank price manipulation, how that influences markets. Were also gonna talk about market competition and the law of decimation and how that plays out in nature and throughout history. Then were gonna get into the philosophical domain, and were gonna touch on a bit of Stoicism and how Saylor has used this in his own life and how he sees its importance in markets in general. Finally well leave off with a bit of discussion on antifragility and the vitality of life. So Im excited for this one, another crazy episode with the incredibly brilliant Michael Saylor. So with that lets dive in!", "image": null}

Its how weve developed everything, essentially! And Im reminded of a quote by Alfred North Whitehead that Ill paraphrase. He said that its common wisdom for people to say you should think before you act, but that in fact civilization advances by us being able to execute more important operations without having to think about them! So were actually  when we can embed these certain important actions in a protocol that we dont need to think about as much, it frees us up to do other things  thats kind of the layers upon which weve built civilization. It just seems like this Digital Age were going into is something radically new! It seems to be as profound as the Renaissance, or as profound as the Enlightenment! Do you see it that way? Are we co-evolving with the tools that were creating and that the next 500 years are gonna be something so fundamentally different than what history has been that it will be difficult to recognize it in a few hundred years?", "image": null}

Maybe one interesting thing is just the science of sterilization. Germs  modern medicine and the awareness and the importance of sterilizing instruments and the way that the disease spreads! Immunology. Once we figured that out, we were able to go from living 50 years to living 70 years because we realized that every time we entered into a medical procedure including the birth of a child, we were entering into a non-sterile environment that was life-threatening, soul-sucking, life-stealing. The death rate from childbirth was huge, right? The average life expectancy was short, and we needed that breakthrough to realize that we were swimming in germs, and the very simple solution is: Wash your hands! Sterilize your instruments! And you put that together with antibiotics and human life expectancy jumps by 50%! What if were actually doing economics with dirty money? And so weve been using monetary energy which is bleeding, right? Its the same way as operating with non-sterile instruments, and the patient keeps dying and we dont know why. The significance of Bitcoin is: Were going from defective money, which is somewhere between toxic  it may just been ineffective, bleeding 2, 3, 4% a yearor its toxic when it gets to -10% or -15% real yield. So using toxic money, how is that different than using toxic instruments when I commit surgery on you? How is it different than feeding you toxic food? I think were breaking through this new world, we sterilize our instruments, we encrypt our money, were moving to a science of non-toxic economic energy. Madame Curie died of radiation poisoning. She died of cancer from the radiation. They didnt realize that radiation killed you, that it caused cancer. Theres a lot of basics in life that we dont understand. A big breakthrough in health was when we realized that sugar was toxic. My mother didnt know that sugar was toxic! Conventional wisdom and governmental advice was you need your four favorite food groups and pursue a low-fat diet but starch and sugar was fine. And of course now we know that too much starch and too much sugar makes you insulin-resistant, makes you Type-2 diabetic, gives you cancer. My mother became diabetic, became overweight, got cancer. We thought it was just unfortunate. The doctors said, We dont know why these things are happening, its just unfortunate. If I could go back in time Id be like, I know exactly why it happens! I know exactly how to solve it now! Like, dont eat sugar, dont eat starch  stop eating! Fast! I never eat before 1 in the afternoon, I only eat in an 8-hour window and Ill go 23 days and I wont eat. I adopt fasting and I wont drink anything with sugar in it. You want to live a long time, dont dose yourself with sugar, its toxic! The instruments are toxic. The germs are toxic. We killed George Washington  we bled him to death! Toxic. The money is toxic. Thats fundamentally the issue. The money is toxic. I mean, thats the fundamental issue with inflation, and if we segue into the discussion of inflation, everybody keeps thinking there is no inflation because everybody focuses upon a market basket of consumer goods. And if you look in the US and you look in Europe, they leave food and energy out of the basket of consumer goods and they say, We left out the highly volatile food and energy from the index. Well highly volatile means it went up! [And if you put them in, 12:06] the number would change! Volatility in other words is the signal! Weve left out everything that actually changes in price from our price index. It literally is like a Jedi Mind Trick, and its like a triple mind trick. Its like: We have a consumer price index and weve left the prices that vary out of the index. We have a consumer price index  well first of all its not a scalar, its a vector. Its an indimensional vector dynamically changing in time  youve just created a scalar. Weve created a market basket of things that we think you want. Yes, your basket is what I want! The market basket of things that you want does not include assets. No! I would never want to buy assets, only rich people buy assets! Poor people do not buy assets! How did poor people get rich? You have to buy assets to go from being poor to being rich. I didnt go from being poor to being wealthy by not buying assets or not creating assets  you create them or you buy them. So the entire field of inflation is defective, and the irony is that 99% of the economists that talk about it, theyve already accepted the notion that a market basket of consumer products and services is acceptable, and its acceptable to throw out energy and good. And Ive never seen an economist say, Why dont we actually define the things that a working 22-year old is gonna want to buy by the time theyre 32? And heres one thing: Early retirement! I want to buy early retirement by the time Im 32. How do I do that? I need to buy a bond that pays me $75,000 a year in interest risk-free, and I need for the $75,000 a year to pay my living expenses. And if the interest rate was 7% then Id need $1 Million for that. But if the interest rate goes to 0.7% Id need $10 Million for that. So from 2010 to 2020 the interest rate went down to 60 basis points on a 10-year government bond which meant that the bond went from $1 Million to $10 Million, which meant that the 22-year old was suffering from 22% inflation on early retirement! But because thats not in the basket because thats not something that you would ever want to give them  theres no inflation! You can actually track it and you can see that the inflation rate changes across a thousand different  if you just started with a simple principle: Inflation is a basket of products, services, or assets. If you just did that, thats kind of the equivalent of saying, Oh its possible the Sun revolves around the Earth, its possible the Earth revolves around the Sun  lets find out which! Has anybody ever asked the question whether or not the basket should include assets? Or products or services? No ones even questioning the most basic premise! Its pernicious rule of propaganda, and its attributed to Joseph Goebbels in the Nazi regime who said  and its also attributed to [Ogilvy 15:31], so maybe its apocryphal  but he said, All of our focus groups show us and tell us we cant tell people what to think. But we can tell them what to think about! I cannot change your mind once youve made it upand if you have an opinion  but I can get you to focus upon something. So if I just keep saying inflation, CPI, and it didnt go up and this is what it isWhens the last time 100 Million people said, What we really wanted to buy was early retirement? I didnt even know that was a product I could buy! Because I couldnt conceive of it! Well it is a product you can buy: Its a government 30-year bond that yields 6% interest in a non-inflationary environment  thats a risk-free retirement. You can buy that! Right now, the problem is at 140 basis points that would cost you $30 Million for $60,000 a year. How do I make that at $75,000 a year salary saving $15,000? If Im making $500,000 a year and I save $100,000you know, I pay $200,000 in tax, I make $300,000, I save $100,000  if I save $100,000 for 20 years Ive got $2 Million, and investing that in a government bond at 60 basis points or 100 basis points, you get nothing! [17:07] So the problem starts with the fact that inflation is misdefined. The right way to think about it is: Every single product, service, or asset has an inflation co-efficient. And the inflationary co-efficient, thats the rate at which the price will change as I pump fiat into the money system. And so the co-efficients vary, and theyre a function of the scarcity of the asset, the demand of the asset, the information content of the asset, the material cost or the variable cost of the asset, and then the modularity of the asset. If I can stamp out the asset a million times out of a factory, its gonna be less inflationary because the fixed cost is higher and the variable cost is lower. Mobile phones will not be inflationary because everythings in the fab. Software will not be inflationary because theres no variable cost. Streaming music on Amazon Music or Apple Music will not be inflationary because I can stream it a billion times. A Picasso will be inflationary because theres only 20, 50, 100. The best 5 acres of beachfront property in the middle of Miami Beach will be inflationary to the extent people want Miami Beach. 5 acres in Ohio will not be inflationary because theres a lot of land in the world. The only land people want is in the middle of New York, the middle of London, the Hamptons, Miami Beach, the middle of LA, the middle of San Francisco, the middle of Tokyo. You fly across this country and look down, theres enough land to park 10 Billion people on 5 acres each! Its just gotta be in demand and scarce.", "image": null}

So the co-efficient itself in my mind would be a product of the scarcity of the good or service relative to the scarcity of the money its denominated in, such that if the money supply is outpacing the production of the good or service, that good or service would inflate in price, right? So to your point its not a single variable  its not CPI is inflation  everything has its own inflation rate. The second part of that question would be: Why is the narrative surrounding inflation so distorted? Do you think its intentional by governments that are clearly heavily indebted? I dont see any equitable benefit to inflation whatsoever, its purely a mechanism for reallocating wealth, and I dont understand why the narratives so distorted!", "image": null}

The whole point of paradigm shifts is: Everybody agreed that the Sun revolved around the Earth. Everybody agreed the world was flat. Everybody agreed that humans would never fly. Everybody agrees on stuff until they realize that theyre just utterly and totally and horrifically wrong! So in this particular case, I blow a bunch of liquidity into the system. Lets say theres $50 Trillion worth of energy and I blow $10 Trillion worth of money in the system. So theres still $50 Trillion worth of energy, but now the money is diluted by 20%, right? So if I have a product and I can measure the pure energy content of the product, then if its 100% pure energy, the price has gotta go up by 20% if I expand the money supply by 20% assuming its completely liquid and in demand. Whats an example of that? Maybe a bond! A pure financial instrument, something that ", "image": null}

This is why proof of work in Bitcoin is [inaudible 21:36]. If it takes me a tangible amount of energy to produce that thing then its inflation co-efficient is going to be like 100%. And on the other hand, the cost to produce a streaming YouTube video, the energy content is 1% of the value added or the value of use. And 99% of the value-in-use is information and non-scarce information. So its got a variable cost of 1%. An iPhones got a variable cost of 30, 35, 40%. Everythings got a different variable cost. Golds got a much higher variable cost, right? Because its holding its energy. So when you look at all these things youll be able to calculate different inflation co-efficients and therefore different inflation rates across an array of thousands of things. Itd be different inflation rates in New York City, Manhattan versus farmland in Kansas. Itd be different! So you cant really say, Oh this asset class. There will be different inflation rates on different stocks. You notice that if the cash flows are likely to continue from the stock, or less affected by inflation, then its gonna go up. So I think the pernicious mistake everybody makes is: They dont really think about energy density and information density of their products, services, and assets. Theyre not applying conservation of energy. If the law of conservation of energy applies, when I increase the money supply by 20% and if the energy is constant, then all of the numbers have to change. And if they didnt change on the deflationary products, they must have changed more on something else! So you cant very well be printing 10% more money and not have the inflation. Its just: Were choosing to pick just 1% of the things that are inflated  the deflationary assets we put them in a bucket. And its almost too easy. If I get to throw out all assets, all real estate, all stocks, all bonds, and then I get to throw out energy, and then I get to throw away food, well how could you possibly generate inflation? Because you could print a hundred-kazillion-trillion-billion dollars and the cost of free, streaming Twitter and YouTube is not going up!", "image": null}

Im a very wealthy man! I cant afford to buy a house in the Hamptons! Like Ill go look at these things and Im like, Whos paying $47 Million? Theyre selling houses for $25 Million on 2 acres! Im like, Are you guys out of your minds? Or you go to New York City and someones paying $25 Million for a 5,000 square foot apartment. $5,000 a square foot! At the end of the day, its obscene. And what you can see is: Were running 1020% inflation for the past decade, were just running it on all of the scarce luxury assets that have high energy value.

And I guess its like theyre just not feeling the pain. And because of that it takes us to the issue of interest, right? If you think inflation is not coming so you keep printing money and you keep driving the interest rate down, the problem we have is really just a war on currency, a war on time, we render the money toxic if you hold the money. Once you understand that the real inflation rate is 1015% because thats how the assets were [clocking 28:10], then you realize that any currency youre holding is draining energy from your life at 10% a year. Its almost like I put in a battery that drains 12% a month. I cant store energy! You know another metaphor for what happens in the human body when you cant store energy? Its like, Robert if I took you and I dropped you in the middle of the Arctic Circle and it was 20 below, your body would start losing energy at a rapid rate, youd freeze to death. Its literally like I come into your office and I crank the temperature down 20 degrees and Im freezing you to death because Im pulling the energy off your skin. And so what do you do? Insulate, cover up, right? But what if you cant? If youre a wealthy person you put on a fur coat, right? Or maybe youre smart enough to realize: What do wealthy people do? You drop them in the Arctic and they get on their jet and they fly to the Caribbean where its warm because they can! And what do you do if youre poor? I drop you in the Arctic, or even worse I go to your hometown and I just turn the temperature down to 20 below and you cant leave! But you know its like I slowly freeze you to death. I dont do it fast. You dont even realize its happening if it happened at a gradual enough rate. Its like, I know Im working hard Im just not getting ahead. Im working hard but Im not getting ahead, because every time I put money in the bank the price of everything keeps going up. The price of a house in Miami Beach it was $1 Million on the street where I live, and then its 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, $10 Million. Im not talking about every decade, Im talking about every year! Im talking 20002010 during that administration we were printing money so fast that we had this housing boom and everybody that owned houses were happy  theyre refinancing their houses  but you look at it and youre like, How is it possible that people bought this house in 1998 for $1 Million and Im being asked to pay $10 Million for the same house?

But lets just say its only 10% just to be nice. Well then youre looking at a real yield of -10%! Youve never seen that number printed in any kind of public media. No one would dare say we have a negative real yield of -10%, it would create a panic! But if you did think negative real yield of -10%, what happens next? You cycle through and you say, Well, if my cash flows of the stock arent going up by more than 10%, thats diluted. The only equity you can buy where youre gonna make out on is where the companys able to grow its cash flows more than 10% a year, right? And then you gotta buy it at a decent price. So if your cash flows are growing 2030% a year maybe its good deal. Thats why people like tech like Facebook or Google or Amazon because they did for a while! I dont know if they will going forward. Its a lot harder, over the next 36 months it seems much less likely that youll see 20% cash flows. Will you see 10%? I dont  what percentage of the S&P 500 will grow cash flows more than 10% this year? Any? 5%? 10%? Probably not more than 10%, right? We could figure it out but if youre not doing that then youre diluted. Of course that means that any fixed bonds that arent generating 10%, theyre long-term diluted. So where does that leave Bitcoin?

Do you think that we dont have a competitive market for everything in this country? Its obscenely competitive! And so what youve got if you look at the NASDAQ is you have like 5 companies  Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft  those 5. And arent they responsible for like 80% of the game? Everybody else is competing and its a competitive market! And what does that mean? It means its hard to grow 20% a year because whenever you do anything someone else is copying you and theyre pushing on you. So unless you get a dominant digital network with a near-monopoly with these massive, exploding economies of scale on a zero variable cost, low variable cost, its very very difficult to perform. And most of the S&P isnt! To the extent that the S&P isnt Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, theyre just a bunch of companies competing with each other, so you would think that they would grow at the productivity growth rate of the overall company which is 23%. If you had hard money  by the way, coming back to that theory of Bitcoin network value  Bitcoin network value goes through the roof, skyrockets in the early days when theres massive adoption and massive technology explosion, but in the later stages of the S-curve when its fully diffused and when its mature, it just grows with the GDP. It grows with the productivity of the people in the network. If they grow 2% a year, it grows 2% a year! So in a mature equity market you would expect equity indexes, equity prices to grow with the GDP. If theyre growing faster, its the monetary expansion, right? Expand the monetary supply 7%, expand the GDP 1%, S&P should go up 8%! Its gonna be disproportionate. The big tech, the leading-edge, innovative tech, is gonna be double, triple, quadruple that, and then the trailing-edge laggards are gonna be tanking, and then everyone thats working their asses off as hard as they can is gonna be barely keeping up! Because you have to do 100,000 things right just to stay in business in a real Darwinian capitalist economy. Its like: Being flat means defeating 99% of the rest of the market  being flat.

If I take my own business  I became public in 1998  theres a 99% mortality rate. 99 out of the 100 companies I competed with are gone. Out of my peers, Im the only person  Im talking about 100 publicly traded companies  theres probably 500 CEOs that launched a company with 20, 30, 50, $100 Million of capital, and theyre all gone! Thats what the open market, the free market, will do. And it is what it is. I mean thats why the human race is what they are. Theres always someone. And when they attack, if youre distracted, if youre arrogant, if youre fat, dumb, happy, comfortable, theyre going to eat you! And if youre half-focused or de-focused, theyre gonna take your arm off! And if youre completely focused, you can react. If theres something theyre doing thats good, you channel it, you inherit it, you evolve, you live and you grow stronger. And otherwise you shrink and they squeeze you out of the entire market. Theres something I observed and again its very Stoic, its: Everybody thinks when youre young you wanna acquire as much as you can acquire. So young men are acquisitive. Young business people are acquisitive. Can you acquire the thing? Thats generally the easiest hurdle to jump. The next question is: Can you maintain the thing? Can you stay competitive? Thats 10 times harder! And the biggest hurdle is: Are you going to be able to commercialize the thing or profit from it? Can you buy something or build something and continuously improve it forever so that youre competitive and then do it in a manner that is cheaper such that you can charge more for it than it costs you to do that thing. Thats obscenely hard! So typically everybody think that they can acquire something, then when they realize the maintenance requirements they fail, and then very people ever get to the point where they could commercialize something. By the way you can apply it to a boat: Everybody wants to buy a boat, and then theyre like, Oh my God! This is really expensive to maintain a boat and I cant afford to maintain the boat. But if they buy the boat, they gotta spend 10% a year to maintain it. And then at some point the question is, Can you enjoy the boat? Theyre like, Oh! Im spending all this money on the boat but I never have time to go and use the boat  this is just crazy! This is weighing around my neck! I gotta get rid of this! Its an example of being too ambitious in your acquisitiveness, and it illustrates the law of decimation. And the law of decimation is: In the ancient Roman republic if the legion screwed up, they killed 1 out of every 10 men in the legion. Actually the made the 9 kill the 10th in order to remind them that they should stay disciplined.", "image": null}

They didnt kill them all because then there would be no legion left! But 1 out of 10 is gonna die if you break ranks and retreat so it was their ultimate punishment, the law of decimation. But you can apply it to anything in life, Robert, but it goes like this: The universe tends towards entropy and disorder. If something will go wrong it does go wrong. Thats Murphys law. The law of decimation is: 1/10th of all the moving parts in anything will break in any given year. If you have 10 employees, 1 will quit or become unhappy. If you have 10 moving parts, 1 will break. If you have 10 plans, 1 will blow up in your face. If you have 10 features, 1 of them will stop working. If you have 100? 10 of them will stop working. If you spend $100 Million on something, you have to spend $10 Million to maintain it. Youre gonna have to divert 10% of the cost of anything to maintain something. I talked about, Steel will last forever  if you maintain it! Most people dont maintain it! It costs a lot of money to paint a steel ship. Most people, they budget for the acquisition, and then they underestimate the maintenance because they dont have the humility or the life experience. This is the problem with building Rube Goldberg devices in the crypto network. Thats the problem with all the complexity with Etherium and all the complexity with some of these things: It sounds good on paper, but when you put 187 moving parts into something and when 1 of them breaks and the entire thing crashes and burns and you die, it wasnt worth it! When youre young, you overestimate the value of functionality and acquisition, and you underestimate how expensive its going to be to maintain things, and then you really underestimate this last issue: Can you enjoy it? This is a basic rule of life: Can I buy the thing? Can I maintain the thing? Can I enjoy the thing? Men are always reaching beyond their fingertips. Sometimes women too. They want too much. Theyre empire-builders. This is why Napoleon should not have gone to Moscow. This is why Hitler should have not have gone to Moscow. This is why you dont fight a war on two fronts. And this is the essence of Stoicism, but Stoicism is really a philosophy that is very consistent with thermodynamics and entropy and complexity theory. And if youve ever run anything complicated or built anything complicated or have been responsible for anything complicated, you know stuff breaks!", "image": null}

It just pops up over and over again! And my only real explanation is just: friction, randomness, chaos, life, corrosion, weather, termites, bugs, bacteria. The same would be true with your body, right? If youre talking about maintaining yourself. Youve got to actually allocate time and energy to maintain yourself and a lot of times people under-invest in their own health. And then when they under-invest in those things they blame it on genetics or they blame it on some unfortunate occurrence. We dont know why these this happened its very unfortunately  these things just happen sometimes. Ill end with one thought on Stoicism. And Nicholas Taleb would appreciate this one too. Its like, The words dont matter  the action matters. Okay? Words are just words. And that applies to Stoics: you and me and Marcus Aurelius. I think one of the great paradoxes of history is Marcus Aurelius was the last emperor in the line of the Antonines during the golden age of Rome and there was Trajan, and there was Hadrian, Marcus Antoninus, etc., and for about 100 years that was the Pax Romana, and each of those emperors was elected based on virtue as an adult and he adopted his heir, and they typically adopted a 40-year old emperor who had had a career in the military of virtue and he was tough and responsible and grounded in reality. And if youre a general in the army campaigning and you get drunk and screw around your soldiers put a knife in you! Youre not gonna make it! In order to keep the respect and stay alive in war-time around a bunch of guys with weapons, you better be a good leader and they better respect you because youre leading them to their death, if they dont respect you! So if you actually rose through that meritocracy, maybe you had a chance. So Marcus Aurelius writes the Meditations and its the quintessential text on Stoicism. And he says, Just because you can do a thing doesnt mean you should do a thing. He said, Soon you will have forgotten all and all will have forgotten you, and you should know your place in the universe, and you should submit yourself and do the right thing for everyone else, and thats all good! But at the end of the day, the single most important decision Marcus Aurelius made in his entire career, in his life, was the decision on an heir, and when it came time to make that decision he failed miserably and he appointed his son Commodus to be the emperor. And Commodus was a minor and of weak moral and intellectual constitution and in no way shape or form qualified to be emperor of all the known world. And by so doing that Marcus Aurelius plunged the Roman Empire into chaos and turmoil for hundreds of years, resulting in the deaths of millions if not tens or hundreds of millions of people  awful! Awful! And theres your philosopher-king! Hes remembered today as somebody thats written a good book and had been a great Stoic. But if you look at his actions, the actual action he took was the least Stoic, most foolish, most painful action of any of his forbears and it just makes the blood curdle!", "image": null}

Its just not in the near-term. Yeah, theres a certain terrifying beauty in nature. There are no ugly animals. You look at a bird that is beautiful. You look at a lion in the wild, its beautiful. No ones got a mangy coat, theres no unhealthy anything, and thats our ideal of beauty, right? We think nature is beautiful, all the trees are beautiful, the plants are beautiful, the birds are beautiful, they chirp their beautiful sounds, the flowers are beautiful. What they dont really think about is whats going on behind the scenes, because theyve got this simple zoo backyard view of nature. The truth is, everythings at its finest when tomorrow is uncertain. When the life of the creature is uncertain. Ive actually got this beautiful banyan vine trees in the back of my house in Florida. One day on a beautiful sunny day I walked by and I stood and stared at the tree and I saw a bunch of ants running up and down. And when I traced the ants I saw that there were thousands of ants and I saw that there was a centipede. Some kind of millipede about a hundred times bigger than a normal ant. And those ants had decided that theyre going to eat that. They were actually gonna haul that millipede back to their queen as dinner. And they attacked it relentlessly, relentlessly. And I watched hundreds and hundreds and then thousands and then thousands of ants going into this one millipede. And its fighting for its life and I swear I watched for 45 minutes like a war non-stop on a beautiful sunny day. If you looked around you wouldve saw grass and blue sky and pretty water and birds chirping, but there was knock-down, drag-out war to devour this millipede and its fighting for its life. And I watched it crawl up the tree and the ants dragged it down and it did everything it could and they kept coming and it just had this horrific, terrifying, sad conclusion. Its gonna die. Unless a massive rainstorm spins up to blow water down and create some disruption its got no chance. Its going to get eaten alive. And its horrific and its terrifying, and thats life! Thats nature! And then you start to realize, on all those pretty National Geographic TV shows, you see the lions attack the antelope or the gazelle and they try and this miss like, Well, no dinner for you tonight! No, the antelope trot off happy with their babies and the lions trot off happy with a little smirk. And everybodys like, Thats about as much nature as they want! Nobody wants any more nature! When you think about it a bit more you realize, Well theyre gonna miss 34 days, theyre gonna hit 1 of those a week, and the 99% of them are gonna live but 1 of them is gonna die, and over 3 years theyre all gonna die. And over 3 years they were all gonna be eaten by the lions. And thats nature! Every week that goes by, its like theyre clicking on a carousel. And the oldest one is getting slower, and a little bit more tired, and a little bit less flexible, and if they dont get the old one, theyre gonna get the unlucky one. And thats why every one of them is beautiful! Because theyre all in the prime of their life! And the same is true with all the predators: theyre all in the prime of their life. When they get a little bit old, a little bit hurt, they get driven out of the tribe or out of the pride and thats the end of it. So in nature the life expectancy of those wolves or those predators or those lions is 5 years, and in the zoo its 15 years. Now if you want to see a fat, mangy, lame one, youll find one in the zoo. You wont find one in the wild. And the same is true with the rest. And when those two herds, when they go at each other like that viciously, theyre both strengthening. You take away the wolves from the deer, the deer overpopulate, they eat all of the trees, the trees all die, the trees die, they destabilize the embankment of the river, the river erodes, the riverbank gets screwed up, all the greenery dies, all the deer are gone, all the wolves are gone. You wanna fix the river? You put the wolves back in. The wolves scare away the deer, the trees grow, the roots stabilize the bank, the river flows, all the wildlife returns. This beautiful thing we call nature is in continual dynamic equilibrium, and everything about it is getting stronger and harder and faster and getting culled all the time. And mother nature is supreme, and men with delusions that they will defeat her are gonna be disappointed, right? I guess the great challenge is this paradox: the paradox is the paradox of the engineer versus the zookeeper. We see nature, we want to engineer a better world for ourselves, and it can be done. But we can also reach too far and try too hard and try to make water flow uphill and try to make time flow backwards. We can try to shake our fist at mother nature, we can defeat all of those natural forces, and if we try to do that, the energy consumption goes up exponentially. And eventually it goes up to such a level that we deplete ourselves of energy, and we end up like those natives on Easter Island where you chop down every tree to build your monuments to your gods and pretty soon theres no canoes and pretty soon theres no fish and pretty soon theres no food and pretty soon theres no you! All youve got is your monuments to your god and youre all dead because you depleted the energy in the ecosystem in pursuit of over-engineering your reality.", "image": null}

So that was Episode 9 of Saylor here at the Saylor Series and wow! What an episode! We started off this series actually with a discussion of Stone Age technologies, which Michael laid out his thesis of how mankind is the dominant animal in the world because we channel energy across time and space more intelligently than any other animal. And he really built the foundation by drilling into our use of fire, one of the primordial energy networks, our use of water as a hydraulic energy network for overcoming gravity, and our use of missiles for actually competing at a distance. And in that lens, if we consider that that is the overarching goal of humanity is to more intelligently or more precisely channel energy across time and space, Bitcoin is an elemental innovation. Its the only system weve ever had throughout history that allows us to channel energy effectively at the speed of light, and store it in a way that is virtually totally loss-minimized. Theres no unexpected inflation for instance, and theres very minimal transaction fees, just enough to sustain the network. [1:05:06] And you could contrast this with something like gold, which we touched on earlier, that just depreciates at 2% per year at least, or something like fiat currency which tends to depreciate much faster. So it takes a lot maybe to get to here. Its a whole re-framing of your worldview, but I think Saylor just does an excellent job of that. And I love the example he gave describing immunology  another one of these elemental innovations  where we figured out antiseptics, we figured out how to use clean medical instruments and disinfectants and whatnot, and the discovery of penicillin for instance  all of these things that helped us insulate ourselves from the entropy of microbes to conduct medical and biological experiments and operations with less exposure to the entropy of nature just catapulted our life expectancy! Almost overnight it went from say 50-year average life expectancy to 70 years. So I wonder  and I love the way he described it as, Doing business, were conducting economics thus far in history with dirty money, with contaminated money. And you could analogize this to doing surgery with contaminated medical instruments! If you dont decontaminate your medical instruments and you try to perform surgery on someone, youre going to cause an infection and youre going to cause death. And this was actually a major cause of death throughout most of history. So through a similar lens, if were trying to build socioeconomic systems using a money thats contaminated with the uncertainty of inflation or confiscation or de-authorization, it tends to make me believe that the system that we would build would be more vulnerable to death as well! And I think that a quick study of history will show you that typically the debasement of money tends to presage the collapse of the civilization. So when the money becomes extra contaminated, this tends to be a specter or a harbinger of its ultimate demise. So I love this analogy! And it really gets into the entropy aspect again. We just consider that entropy is uncertainty. [1:07:35] We want medical instruments that are free from the uncertainty of microbial infection. We want economic instruments that are free from the uncertainty of inflation and de-authorization and confiscation. Like, it just makes sense. The more certainty we can add to our tool set whether in the medical or the economic domain, the more longevity we can give the organism or the organization, right? It just makes sense. And as Saylor said earlier, Monetary energy being the highest form of energy that humans can channel, and channeling energy across space and time being the highest aim of man, that effectively monetary energy is life energy! It gives us a claim on all other forms of energy. So we can think of encryption actually  I think Saylor Tweeted this at some point  that the destiny of all money is to be encrypted. We can think of encryption itself as a sterilization function or process for money. Weve actually disinfected the money by encrypting its rules and its supply. That hearkens back to consumer packaged goods, when were able to vacuum seal foods and store food energy in a stable fashion at room temperature  that was a game changer! All of a sudden we had this abundance of economic surplus in food energy that we could distribute around the world, and this led to a surge in population growth. So all these analogies pointing back to this breakthrough that is Bitcoin that again weve been building on in earlier episodes I just found to be super-exciting! And then in that lens, Saylor also talked about the story of his mother being diabetic. And the connection I made there was that she was essentially following a governmental food advisory, just eating the typical food pyramid that governments  at least the US government  used to advise, which had carbs as the staple, the big thing at the bottom: bread, pasta, etc., and worked its way up. Whereas in fact, anyone that studied ketogenics and the paleodiets and whatnot, it tends to actually be the opposite: you want low-carb, high-fat or high protein diets. And its not the same, its not one size fits all, but a lot of diseases we suffer from today like diabetes is from excessive carb consumption. So the connection I made there was that this government food pyramid scheme or mistake  whatever you want to call it, whether the intention was good or bad  its actually rooted in the government fiat currency pyramid scheme, where we have contaminated the money. So weve contaminated even the ideologies we put out in terms of nutrition, and it just has these cascading effects. Inflation is not just contaminating our economic efforts, but it actually bleeds over into the biological domain. So as Saylor said, Fiat currency is toxic money. Its just not sound. It is not entropy-free. Its infected with entropy, and this has all these second-order effects with everything that it touches. [1:11:10] And the main problem is this misunderstanding about inflation. We have this whole economic sphere today focused on CPI as inflation. But it doesnt make any sense at all. Theres deeper reasons why if you read a book like Human Action by Mises that you can can never have an index for inflation, because, sort of like value itself or beauty, its subjective, right? Its based on the things that you individually desire, based on the course of your own goal-directed action, so theres not a universal index that can fit everyone. Your own inflation number is a basket of these goods that youre seeking. And the government metric is just taking what they assume to be things that are desirable, but exclude assets. So its like theyre excluding the fact that anyone wants to get wealthy, which is absurd. Also excluding food and energy and other volatile assets. Volatile meaning they changed in price! Were talking about a metric that is intended to reflect price changes excluding things that changed in price. It is a non-starter, its absolutely crazy! And this is still the benchmark number that so many people are focused on and its just amazing to me that it still goes on. And the discussion flowed into understanding inflation, which for me I think this makes more sense which is: If you think about it in rate of change terms, as in how many Dollars are being produced? The growth in Dollar production relative to the growth in good or service production. If you pace a fiat currency production thats outpacing the productivity gains or the output on a particular good or service, its going to inflate in price because youre going to have more dollars chasing the same or only slightly growing goods or services. So another way to say that is: How energy-intensive is the good? The example that I like to think about is ribeye steak. Were not gonna invent a technological breakthrough that makes cows grow faster. It still requires the same amount of sunlight and energy and time and processing to deliver a ribeye steak, and it turns out historically that actually the purchasing power of gold maps pretty nicely to ribeye steak, or cows more generally. [1:13:48] So in that way inflation is not a single universal phenomenon that we can peg to one index number. Its occurring differently for every asset and every person in every place at every time. Its just this undulating sphere of changing economic values. You cant possibly just put a number to it and say that is inflation. Another way to say that is its just uneven across space and time. So youre dumping new money supply into the system, that money itself is distributed unevenly, and then the aims of economic actors are shifting unevenly as well, supply and demand. So its just hubris to think that we could peg it all to one index number! To that point, Saylor makes a more sound argument that a more appropriate measure of inflation  knowing that we cant peg it to a number  but what we can do is say, What are things that people generally desire, and how much are their prices changing year over year? He gave the example earlier of retirement, premier real estate, things like this  things that people actually want in life! You dont go to work to think, I just want to put food on the table for the rest of my life. At some point youd like to work towards an aim or a goal whether thats a nice home, living in a nice neighborhood, possibly I love the example of early retirement where you can just buy a government bond that pays you a risk-free rate for the next 30 years, and looking at the price of government bonds and how much thats jumped based on monetary policy. So I thought that was just a great example. Its interesting because when you really get to first principles on it, fiat currency inflation as we define it is just an arbitrary increase in the money supply that adds no economic value to an economy whatsoever. Its very important to understand that by printing money, youre not infusing an economy with any new factors of production, whether this is human time, ingenuity, tools to put in factories, theres nothing being added to the economy. Youve just reshuffled the paper claims on those productive factors. Youve taken away from those relying on fiat currency or the Dollar as a store of value. Youve reallocated those claims to whoever can get their hands on the new printed money first and spend it first. So it is a mechanism for theft. I dont know what else to call it, frankly. It only has one purpose. You can argue about the intentionality  whatever. Im not going to debate that. I can just tell you that the tool, fiat currency  the inflation of fiat currency  has only one purpose: To reallocate wealth from some and allocate to others against their will. So I dont know what else you could call it really besides theft. And it seems to me like this Keynesian ideology feels like a coverup! I dont if they just believe what theyre saying about inflation. Saylor was arguing that they bled George Washington to death and they thought that was the best course of action  maybe that is the case! Maybe Keynesian economics are so deeply steeped in this ideology that they just cant see their own hand in front of their face so to speak. Or perhaps its something more nefarious, more of a propaganda stick thing. But regardless, I love the point that  he tied this into an old German propaganda machine. He said: The studies show them that they cant tell people what to think, but they can tell people what to think about. And it is amazing to me how many sophisticated investors Ive talked to about Bitcoin and macroeconomics over the years, and people are just anchored to CPI as inflation. Its as if this wool has just been pulled over their eyes, that they are satisfied with the answer presented to them versus thinking more deeply about it. And I cant help think its related to this, right? Its pushed as the representation of inflation and people just accept it at face value, which is just a really bad deal all the way around. [1:18:37] So we got into a bit of discussion about interest rates, and his analogy of actually suppressing interest rates is freezing out market participants or sucking the air out of the room. If you consider that the interest rate is the price of money, money is this tool for trading time and energy, we could consider that the interest rate is the price of time or energy, effectively. And when you try and suppress it, youre fighting against the natural flow of time, if you will. Its this misguided attempt to try and mute entropy that causes  Taleb would call this an iatrogenic effect. So its harm caused by the healer. When someone overmedicates  again back to George Washington  they thought they were helping George Washington by bleeding him, but they were actually hurting him. They actually killed him by doing that. You know, many doctors today will prescribe you a pill for your cholesterol or your anxiety or whatever it may be. Whereas in fact the right treatment of the core problem  not just a drug to cover up the symptoms  could be something more like removal. Elimination of certain foods from your diet or fasting or whatever it may be. And this to me, it points towards what central banks ostensibly at least have been trying to do, is that their explicit aim is price stability and low unemployment. So price stability, youre saying that you want supply and demand worldwide to be like consistently close enough to keep prices stable. It just doesnt make any sense. Youre arguing against the entropy of nature again. And when you try and artificially inflate the money supply to create this veneer of stability, youre actually just delaying  first of all youre manipulating market prices  supply and demand, buyers and sellers, are having trouble getting matched up correctly, which is what the market does because of this distortion in the marketplace. But youre also delaying and exacerbating the ultimate correction, because you cant fool economic reality. In that way I see  the vision I have in mind  is central banking is kind of like an air conditioner. An air conditioner is a heat pump, so its pulling entropy out of the room. Its not actually putting cold air into the room, its pulling hot air out of the room, or heat energy out of the room. And if youve ever stood behind an air conditioner, youll feel it! Youll feel the heat coming off of it that its pumping out of that room that its air conditioning. And it seems like a central bank is trying to accomplish that in a way, its trying to paper over the entropy, the natural entropy of price stability and unemployment. But in doing so its pumping out  its creating certainty for its shareholders, lets say , so its decreasing entropy for its shareholdersbut its pumping out entropy onto broader society in the form of price distortions, an exacerbated boom and bust business cycle, and you could even throw warfare in there! Central banks were originally set up to fund warfare, to give governments a virtual limitless mechanism for funding the war. Where instead of just needing to rely on their own savings they could just print money and siphon savings off the entire productive economy. So thats my central banking air conditioning analogy, that its trying to cool the room for its shareholders but its pumping heat onto broader society and its just disastrous. [1:22:52] So we got into the relationship between inflation rates and the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate would be yield on government bonds. So in finance we say that  and this is a risk-free rate  that the US government for instance cannot default on its debt because it can always just print more money to pay its principle. What that actually means is that it can never default on its debt because it can externalize the cost of that debt onto society via inflation. So thats your risk-free rate, whatever the US 10 or 30-year treasury is yielding. And then theres the inflation rate  again not CPI  our proxy is how quickly is the US M2 increasing on a percentage basis. And the delta between these two is a negative real yield! If I can only get 2% on US treasuries  its lower than that today  but US M2 is growing at 15% year over year, its expected to do that over the next few years, then Ive got a negative real yield of of -13%! So unless Im growing my business or my own personal cash flows by more than 13% year over year, then Im being diluted! Im losing money! So this is the hurdle rate, basically, to use another investment term. You need to at least exceed the delta between inflation and the risk-free rate to even be accretive to your business or your household, whatever it may be. So the only way to do this is you need to buy an equity  and a lot of people are doing this  theyre buying equities as a store of value that is expected to appreciate faster than that negative real yield. A lot of this is in tech because tech has just a ton of productivity gains associated with it, and it had a great decade so there start to be market actor expectations built into the price, where if you look at the P/E ratio of something like Zoom or even Tesla or Facebook, theyre astronomically high relative to historic averages! Another way to think about that is: Theres nowhere to store your value thats safe except these equities that are expected to grow and outpace the hurdle rate and remain relatively scarce. So that leaves with these bonds that are yielding less than the inflation rate, theyre long-term dilutive, and then those negative real yields, thats driving and incentivizing people to buy scarce assets. Again: equities, real estate, gold, and then this is also the bucket you put Bitcoins value prop in, is that its the scarcest liquid asset in human history, so of course its gonna benefit from this centrally planned market manipulation in both the bond and the fiat currency markets. And we talked a bit about this, just one way to strip out central banking market manipulation and get an honest assessment of whats going on, is to just price the index in gold or Bitcoin  again Bitcoins a bit more noisy because its emergent  gold has a much longer history. Or to Saylors point you could also price it in the change in money supply. And this will strip out a lot of the manipulation. So if you look at the past decade in the S&P, its been one long bull market  you price that same chart in gold, its flat. There hasnt been a lot. So thats I think really important as far as changing your economic frame of reference, which is whats so tricky about talking about these things, about like What is Money? [1:26:51] Because its an a priori perception. An a priori means no priors. Youre looking at what is looking, so to speak. And people just  the a priori economic way in which were in today is Dollars for most people: this is what they think in, thats what they trade in and negotiate in. But you have to look at the dilution occurring in that frame of reference, which is the Dollar. So its a bit of a meta-thinking, but its really important for coming to sound economic conclusions and calculations. Then we got into the competition and the law of decimation. Saylor made the point that, Even if youre smarter than 99%  say you are one of the top 0.1% most intelligent people in the world, you were smarter than 99.99% of humanity, there are still on this planet 750,000 people smarter than you! That was just crazy to me to think of it that way. And in the digital age, I think what were entering into is this Age of Excellency almost where because the bounds of location have been lifted through digital tools and technologies, its no longer good enough to just be the best local guy at whatever it is  singing, for instance. Maybe youre a Billy Joel impersonator or something. Its no longer a good career strategy to just be the best Billy Joel impersonator in your neighborhood. Because people have YouTube now! They can go and look at the best Billy Joel impersonator of all time, or maybe even Billy Joel himself, and they can seek their entertainment there. So you start competing for audience with the best of the best in any domain that can be conducted remotely, which increasingly is every domain. So this means that excellency is gonna have more of a tendency to rise to the surface, and that markets more typically are gonna converge on winner-take-all dynamics. It changes things a lot! This non-locality or not being bound by geography really changes the game a lot in a lot of ways. So Saylors point was: Youve got to focus your energies to compete well on your speciality  whatever that is, whatever skillset or unique ability you have, whatever gift you might have  and youve got to stay humble, and you really have to focus on that, developing it to the best of your ability, but also maintain the humility I think necessary to succeed and learn and grow. [1:29:44] Any time  as he was describing his experiences at Microstrategy, its ferociously competitive!  any time you become arrogant or comfortable or resting on your laurels, 1 of those 750,000 are just gonna eat you up! They could go out, raise a bunch of money, they want what you have by definition if youre successful. If anything, digital tech has made the world more fiercely competitive, which I thought was really interesting. As far as the law of decimation, we brought up the point that in Ancient Rome, the law of decimation was: Any time the soldiers broke ranks or retreated, 10% of them would randomly be put to death, and they would make the other 9 put the 10th to death. And what this was was a massive disincentive to malperformance. Everyone had a big incentive to hold the line so to speak, and to act in a concerted effort, because if they didnt, if they got fearful or started operating in their own individual best interest in a battle, when you need the collective effort of the battalion to win, then theyre engaging in this lottery where either theyre gonna be put to death or at least 1 in 10 of their friends is gonna be put to death. A really good system for inducing skin in the game. And it turns out that this isagain getting back to the natural law  its sort of a reflection of what we observe in nature, in that 1 in 10 of any system with 10 moving parts, 1 is gonna break down over a year, roughly. A 10% breakdown in parts or features per year! I observe that as just being again were creating these systems that are intended to confront the entropy of nature and deal with it in certain ways  well that has a cost, right? And every year, by some universal magic that number tends to be about 10%. And this pointed back to steel: as Saylor referred to, Steel will last forever if you maintain it! So you need to expend the 10% per year painting it to maintain it. Maybe this is also related to the religious tithing which we see as a 10% contribution annually to the institution  and thats across a number of religions. And I think this too points to a strength of Bitcoin, is that it actually has minimized moving parts. And its open source so anything that does break down, theres as many eyes on it as possible to repair it. But it minimizes its  say in comparison to Ethereum that just has countless moving parts  its gonna suffer more from this law of decimation over time than something like Bitcoin will, which optimizes for survivability. Finally we got into the philosophy of Stoicism. And this is a philosophy which ties back into everything that weve been talking about: Its consistent with thermodynamics. So again if were just saying it in a purely physics sense, Truth is an accurate portrayal of reality. We know that everything in the universe is energy. So therefore conservation of energy  which is the first law of thermodynamics  that is truthfulness! So the systems, the strategies, the techniques, the businesses, the individuals that optimize for energy conservation  this doesnt just mean defending all of the energy you have, you can actually increase energy efficiency through innovation. So being exploratory, figuring out a new way of doing things can actually add to your energy efficiency as well. So theres this ratcheting effect between defending what youve gained and gaining new innovation. So Stoicism is this thermodynamic philosophy if you will, which I think is so cool, that its a way that many of the ancients accorded their behavior, and it directly maps onto innovation and general biological success. So the Stoic  again we had this law of decimation, we had these systems encountering the chaos of nature, theres a little bit of breakdown over time  the Stoic embraces that! The Stoic knows and willingly embraces death, the potential death of your child, the potential loss of your business or your fortune. There are all these practices when you get into Stoicism like negative visualization, where you may imagine for instance the next time you hug your mother, you just imagine that that may be the last time that you ever hug her. And through that mental practice youre actually training yourself to be more grateful for something in the moment, and youre preparing yourself for the inevitable loss that will come, right? Your mother will be gone one day. So Stoicism is a deep rabbit hole in an unto itself. And Ill just leave it at one example. I just thought it was really cool that Stoics embrace entropy and choose to accept it and strive on valiantly nonetheless. And I think thats the only proper approach to life if youre gonna be successful. Saylor went into a paradox of Marcus Aurelius which I had ever heard before  Im a big fan of Marcus. Marcus was this great philosopher king, great writer, but in the end, sort of blew it on one decision. And Saylors point here was, Words dont matter, actions do, ultimately. And even one action can undo a lifetime of good action. This reminded me of Talebs, Dont tell me what you think, just show me whats in your portfolio. Its more about what actions you take with skin in the game versus your cognitive beliefs. And for me personally I tied this back to religion actually is that, people always want to argue, Do you believe in God? Do you not believe in God? I love Jordan Petersons answer to this: I act as if God exists! God doesnt care about my cognitive beliefs, its more about my embodied action and my moral behavior that really matters in the world. So its a bit of an Occams Razor thing there. But anyways, the story of Marcus is, he had the keys to the kingdom. One of the most successful emperors of all time, he was the Platonic ideal of the philosopher king, and on his final decision essentially as emperor of Rome, decided to break duty, break with tradition, break with the Stoic protocol if you will of appointing the most competent man for the job for succession, and instead appointed Commodus, which was his son. And theres something really deep here. Theres this age-old struggle between duty and love. I dont knowthis one left me thinking! So Id be excited to hear some of your guys feedback on this. But its really fascinating to me that we had this guy wed held in such high regard and then at the last yard-line so to speak he just fumbled the ball! But I dont know if this was based on love for his son or something else, but itd be really interesting, right? If he made this decision out of love so to speak, yet it still proved to be wrong decision for civilization. Just a mind-bending thing, but I thought it was super interesting. And the warning there is: You can live a good life, you can be a good leader, a good writer, whatever, but you have to always remain humble and never become arrogant no matter how much success youve had because theres always that opportunity to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, as Saylor put it, which I thought was brilliant. Then finally we completed the episode with a discussion of antifragility and vitality. And I love this point that animals in the wild are all beautiful because theyre constantly being conditioned against the chaos of nature! Once they went past the tipping point of misfitness theyre no longer serving their highest and best function in the world, something else eats them. Theyre gone. So its nature rolling forward and becoming better through this process, this dynamic equilibrium between predator and prey, and its this Darwinian natural selection thats constantly promulgating excellence and beauty in the world. And its great to behold! If youve ever watched a nature documentary its one of the most awe-inspiring things I think that we can watch! So another way to think about this is just nature constantly sharpening her own strategies against herself. So the strategies of animals  the survival strategies  are constantly being tested against the environment. And those that succeed roll forward and those that do not are weeded out and so youre left with by definition the most fit creature for its environment. When we try and disturb that dynamic equilibrium were just exacerbating that correction. Instead of having these little corrections along the way, were giving time for the strategy and the environment to diverge significantly to where an ultimate cataclysmic return is necessary. Thats what nature does! It always selects and it always restores balance. So all of that tying back into  again when I think that central banking is just a failure of an institution because its tried to over-engineer this dynamic equilibrium of nature where we have price instability and unemployment as a natural product of the business cycle, its trying to paper over that, its trying to eliminate this dynamic equilibrium and create something thats predictable. Its trying to subdue the entropy of nature if you will, which could be a good intention but clearly has a poor result, which leads to suppressed interest rates which is like trying to reverse the flow of time. So its all of this effort going countervailing to nature that always fails! Thats the core point here. It turns nature into a zoo! Right? We said that every animal is beautiful, but if you really want to see some not-beautiful animals you can actually go to a zoo. Theyre sad, theyre in a cage, theyre not fulfilling the function for which they were evolved, and I think central banking sort of turns society into a zoo. It softens us  in this process of trying to protect us from price instability and unemployment, its actually reducing our skin in the game, softening us, externalizing entropy onto society. So yeah! Just another awesome episode. Hope you guys enjoyed this. Saylor and I are gonna do at least 1 more episode, maybe more after that, were gonna see how it goes. But I hope you enjoyed this one as much as I did, and Ill see you here again soon! Thanks!", "image": null}

Welcome back to Episode 8 of the Saylor Series here on the What is Money? Show! Today were gonna talk about a number of interesting concepts getting even deeper into Bitcoin theory and how it has effects on the future of humanity. So if you havent seen Episodes 17, I highly recommend you check those out. A lot of the material we built upon there, its compounding as we get deeper into Bitcoin theory. So today were gonna talk about a number of things. Firstly is the divinity of engineering, actually, and how this creative impulse is sort of what defines Man and fulfills Man. Were also gonna look at Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and talk about why Saylor thinks its actually a low frequency medium of exchange and a high frequency store of value. Well also learn why its a pretty bad idea to compensate people with Bitcoin. It turns out the tax codes are pretty hostile to that at the current time. Well also look at another monetary function of Bitcoin, and thats as a unit of account. Were gonna look at Bitcoin too in a macro context: How it sits as an asset class adjacent to other asset classes. Were also gonna do a deep dive into crypto versus digital networks. This is a delineation that Saylor makes to distinguish decentralized crypto networks versus centralized digital networks. And well talk about the trade-offs between the two. Then were gonna get into the really interesting topic of immortal sovereignty, which is something that crypto networks enable and actually allow us to project our preferences beyond our own life. I think thats a really interesting part of the conversation. Were gonna revisit money as power, were gonna talk about advanced technology as magic, and were gonna see what the two of those look like when they come together. And then finally well discuss Bitcoin as a pure and principled ideology, which is something somewhat unique in the modern age. So this is another big episode! I hope you guys have seen 17. If not, again, go check those out now. And with that, lets jump in!", "image": null}

My religious tradition too was Southern Baptist  I was raised Southern Baptist  so I have Judeo-Christian underpinning in my thought. But the ancient idea in Genesis was that God was the force that confronts chaos with courage, truth, love, and converts that chaos into good, inhabitable order. So when we look at that through a thermodynamic lens, we know that the whole universe is everywhere and always trending towards increasing chaos and entropy, and that the only thing that works against that thermodynamic arrow of time is life, actually! Life converts entropy into order. So in a way we could say that life or even the God-aspect of life is the anti-entropic principle that propagates through all of life. And I cant help but relate that and see Bitcoin in that lens, too, where we do have this system thats actually reaching deeper into chaos than anything else. The SHA-256 mining algorithm is quite literally finding a single atom in an entire universe  that is the mining race, if you will, is identifying the single atom in the universe  and with that reach into chaos it is forging the most profound order weve ever had! You cant argue with the Bitcoin blockchain. Whoever has those UTXOs has them! So it seems to me like there is a profound connection between truth and this principle of converting chaos into order, and the quote that took that home for me with G. K. Chesterton was, A dead thing can go with the stream, only a living thing can swim against it. So Bitcoin in that sense is quite literally alive!", "image": null}

The beaver is engineering the stream to create a dam, human beings are engineering systems. Bitcoin is an engineered monetary energy system. Its the first well-engineered monetary system that weve built. Human beings through their intellect channel that energy, and within the [Bitcoin] system we extract order and we have a very efficient structure, and the price we pay is some disorder outside of our system. Some energy dissipation. But Im not terribly concerned with that. The universe has got more energy than it needs and were just dipping our fingers into 0.000  with a million kazillion 0s after it  0001%, right? So it can spare a little bit of energy! And when we create something beautiful  be it a railroad or Bitcoin network or social network or the like  we find a way to do something millions of times faster, smarter, stronger than before, and that drives forward the human race. So this is not the only great achievement of the human race, it just happens to be the most interesting achievement of the human race!", "image": null}

The human that constructs the city. The human that creates the machine. And thats been going on for human history! Thats the most honorable and admirable thing that human beings can do. And if we didnt do it, wed be running around naked on the plains being chased by wolves and probably eaten by wolves. And thats that. So to engineer is divine. Look at a problem, engineer a solution.

And its important that, in that regard, you be able to exchange assets. Its, in my opinion, utterly unimportant that you be able to engage in high frequency small transactions on the Bitcoin network. And I think that its dysfunctional to pursue that vision. I think that Roger Ver is just wrong! I mean it was a nice idea. Roger Ver thinks the magic in Bitcoin is to be able to pay for coffee with your phone. And its a tragic error of insight  that was not the magic of Bitcoin then and it isnt now! The magic of Bitcoin is being able to catapult energy 100 years into the future and not lose the energy. And then the other magics are the magics that come from wrapping the Bitcoin with software to make it smarter, faster, and the stronger  thats the magic! The ability to do a minor transaction, its trivially inconsequential. Number one, only 12% of your wealth needs to be in these high frequency transactions. So a logical thing for anybody is just to keep 1, 2, 3% of their wealth in fiat. And then operate it on the Paypal network or the Visa network or the Apple Pay network or some centralized network. I think Saifedeans already made the point: A proof of work network is a billion times or a trillion times less efficient than the centralized version. So youre gonna get a billion times more speed and a billion times more economy by running the 1% of your life on a centralized network. And if you didnt need to move it to off-chain  I dont even think its a crypto, I just think off-chains just a centralized network! You might as well just put it on Square or Apple, because nobody cares whether they go out of business in a year, 2 years or 5 years. And if youre in a country, the fact that those transactions are being monitored just means that, well, 1% of the value of your transactions are being monitored! If you want to do something illicit, you would do it 0.01% of the time on the Bitcoin network! So the one time in your life when you need to flee Iraq or Syria as a refugee, and thats when you need to do your on-chain transaction, well then you use Bitcoin and you can wait 30 minutes  youll probably be okay. By definition: If you move $1 Billion once, its a billion times more valuable than moving $1 once. And so the use case of moving $1 Billion back and forth is valuable, and you can pay high transaction fees. And the use case of moving $1, $2, $3, $5, $10, or $50 or $100 is not valuable, because it falls exponentially or at least linearly with the amount of money being moved. Now theres some other reasons why Bitcoin doesnt make sense as a medium of exchange right now. And maybe never! I tend to think never. I think whats gonna happen is  well we can debate semantics about what medium of exchange means  but I think Bitcoin is a high frequency store of value, low frequency settlement network. Or low frequency medium of exchange. Once a month is more than enough! Once a year? Maybe enough! Once in a lifetime? Might be enough! If the rest of the ecosystem develops, there will be a point at which theres a crypto bank and Robert Breedlove has 200 Bitcoin in the account and he points the bank toward the Bitcoin and the Bitcoins worth $1 Million a Bitcoin and the bank will forward you fiat on credit at good rates to do whatever you want your entire life  the Bitcoin will never move. And the bank will do whatever, and if the bank fails, what do you care? The bank failed, not you. It doesnt matter, youve got 1%, youve got nothing at risk, they actually took all the risk! So you dont need to do things with a high frequency to create value other than protect the money. Now there are some accounting and systems and tax reasons why it doesnt make sense as a medium of exchange. The obvious thing is: Every time you actually take revenue in Bitcoin, it would be a taxable event. You would mark the Bitcoin. So if you paid me in Bitcoin while Bitcoin is trading at $10,500, I have to mark it. You pay me $27 in Bitcoin, I have a ledger entry: $27 of Bitcoin with $10,400 basis. If your friend bought another $32 book, I have another ledger entry! If I sold a million things in Bitcoin, Id have a million ledger entries with a million different basis prices. And then if I paid you a salary in Bitcoin, I would then have to figure out capital gain on it, and then Id have to pay the tax. So if I have $100 Million in Bitcoin and then next year I pay $100 Million in expenses in Bitcoin and Bitcoin went up by a factor of 2, I would actually generate $100 Million in capital gains and I would owe $20-$30 Million to the federal government within 12 months for the privilege of running Bitcoin, which runs a billion times slower than Apple Pay! So how many ways is this awful? Well first of all, it takes a decade to get your accounting systems to work. Its worthwhile to note: How does a global multinational work? I have 27 subsidiaries in 27 countries. I do business in about 1015 different currencies: US, Euro, Yuan, Yen, Pesos, Real, Mexican Peso, Argentine Peso  you name it! Weve got lots of currencies! By law we do that. By law we pay all the medical bills in those currencies, all the insurance, all the vendor relationships  took 10 years. It takes 10 years to set up a global multinational from start to finish! [18:17] It probably takes 5 years to get all your accounting systems to work right, $20, $30, $40 Million to get it all working right. If I buy $500 Million in Bitcoin, I put it in the treasury, I stare at it, I never do another transaction hopefully for the next decade. Until were in an insolvency event, were not moving it, right? Why would we? The truth is, we want to put it in the vault and throw away the key! Like, I would say to anybody, I dont want to be able to move it! I just want it to sit there! Im gonna wait for it to appreciate. Then we sell stuff in Yuan and Yen and Euro and Dollar, and we put that into our accounts. We sweep all the fiat into maybe one currency, into one thing: Dollar. We balance, and if we need to shuffle some stuff around in working capital accounts we put it back. If we dont need it for working capital we sweep it into the treasury. If its in the treasury, we convert it to the treasury reserve asset  Bitcoin! It goes in, never comes out! You know, a vendor wants  they send me a bill, I pay them in a local currency. No vendors gonna bill me in Bitcoin. People say  Ive heard this  Well, dont your employees want to get paid in Bitcoin? Well the answer is, No, they dont! But lets say the answer was, Yes. Lets say all of them were Bitcoin maximalists. Exactly how much Bitcoin do they want to get paid in? They have mortgages. They have bills. So the answer is, We pay them in the local currency, and if they want to buy Bitcoin, or if they want Bitcoin, they buy it! Why would it be an awful mistake to pay them in Bitcoin? Because we would accelerate the tax bill by 100 years. And as Bitcoin is volatile, we will generate all sorts of tax obligations. The second thing is, we would increase our accounting complexity by an order of magnitude. And the third is, our employees will then have to sell the Bitcoin and generate their own taxable accounting complexity in order to get cash to pay their mortgage and pay for their kids school or whatever theyre doing, right? So youre creating lots of complexity here. If Ive got 2,000 employees and 200 of em want to own Bitcoin then I pay all 2,000 in Euros and Dollars and Pesos and Yen and Yuan and they go on their local exchange and they buy the Bitcoin and they HODL it! Because like, Do I want to HODL it? So the point is, when youre running a company with Bitcoin as an operating system, the logical thing to do is you just sweep your fiat into your treasury, convert your treasury into Bitcoin, let it sit there, and then let every  if a vendor wants to get paid in Bitcoin, I pay them in Dollars, they buy Bitcoin! If an employee wants to get paid in Bitcoin, I pay them in Dollars, they buy Bitcoin! The whole ethos of Bitcoin is: Take responsibility for yourself! Dont treat adults like children. So its patronizing in a way for me to say, Well Robert you work for me, but Im gonna help you by paying you in Bitcoin! Its like, Youre a smart enough person  if you want to buy Bitcoin with it, heres the money. Buy Bitcoin with it  have at it! Its what you do. The money has a constant value at the time Ive transferred it from me to you, and the thing that really cripples a cryptocurrency and a thing like Bitcoin as a medium of exchange is the tax treatment that the local regulatory domain makes. At the point that the United States IRS decided that this was going to be taxed as a capital gain on the moment of sale, it was utterly impossible for it to be a currency. Its just that simple. Its done. For anybody to even maintain it  the only way you could think that you could use it as currency is if youre gonna run a black market, grey market operation with no accounting, no accountants, no lawyers on staff. And its like, Good luck with that! I mean, how many discos and bars got shut down for sales tax or income tax evasion, right? What was it, like  most of them! Small businesses, theyre eventually going to all run afoul of the regulators and get shut down. So its just not practical from a systems point of view. It would take me a decade to rewire the systems. Its not practical from a complexity point of view. Youve just made your accounting a hundred times as complex. And its not practical from a tax point of view. [23:38] Youve just tripled the tax rate. And its not practical from a whatever employee point of view because its making everybody elses life more complicated too. So thats why I think that Bitcoin really isnt a medium of exchange as much as it is just a low frequency settlement network. Ill make one more point, this is back to via negativa: The fact that you could settle peer-to-peer means that you might not have to for 100 years! The fact that I say to you, Robert you do as I say, or else!  if you have the ability to leave the country and depart with all of your wealth and I know you have the ability  right? Robert Heinlein has a phrase, An armed society is a polite society. I live in Miami Beach. Sometimes I run around, and people have guns in Miami. You can carry concealed carry permit, right? A young debutante that looks harmless could be walking around with a gun in her purse, and you think twice when its 2 in the morning and youre in a bar and everybodys drunk, before youre pushy or rude. And then you think, Maybe I shouldnt be in a bar at 2 in the morning when people are drunk! And then you think, Maybe I shouldnt mouth off to someone that just cut me off on the highway. Somebody pulls over and they shoot you dead! And you think, I just oughta be very polite to everybody walking down the street, because every single person could have a gun concealed on their person. And maybe Ill be nice to people today! Its a deterrent, right? So the ability to cash settle, or the ability to settle and exchange, thats the deterrent. Because the fact that I know you could means that Im gonna treat you with respect! If I knew you couldnt, if I thought that you were trapped  if you were stuck in my monopoly and I had total power over youthen I start to take you for granted. And then I start to abuse that power. Because as Lord Acton said, Absolute power corrupts absolutely. So the power to do a thing is more important than the doing of the thing. And thats what the Bitcoin Cash guys, they miss. They miss the fact that: If I can move all the money when I need to, then I wont need to! And so yeah I need to be able to move it so it will hold $100 Trillion in value, but no I dont need to move it now! And maybe I dont need to move it more than once, ever, just to make an example. Its like nuclear deterrence. I use it once, maybe I used it twice  I havent used it since. But do you think that doesnt  you know, its not effective? You think it doesnt matter to have it?", "image": null}

They can go to other providers, they could settle elsewhere, they could move their capital out. And because they have that optionality, you as the producer or provider are accountable to their preferences. You have to listen to the customer. You have to listen to their wishes and desires and make sure youre satisfying their wants. Whereas on the other end of that spectrum is the monopolist that, to your point, he just doesnt care about the preferences of his customer because his customers have no choice! Theyre stuck in his little fiefdom. I mean its the difference between an economic democracy and an economic dictatorship. So the fact that Bitcoin is just totally movable anywhere, anytime and you cant put the gate around it and monopolize it is what makes it such a game-changer!", "image": null}

Not a very profitable pursuit of human ingenuity! You know, you ask Meyer Lansky, Whatd you learn in all your years as a gangster? He said, It was so hard I realized if Id have to do it again I just wouldve gone straight! Its a lot easier to make money just being legitimate, so inventing some kind of technology to evade the regulators explicitly? Its like, they might let you invent something that will carry energy 100 years forward, because it seems like something that legitimate law-abiding citizens might want to do. Theyre not gonna let you invent something that allows you to evade taxes, and so: Why try so hard? Its just not worth the trouble! Im reminded of the stories of Pablo Escobar, and he made the billions of dollars selling all the drugs and cocaine and they said at the end of his life hes sitting on the run and theyre burning $100 bills in order to stay warm!

Its an example of just trying too hardnot worth the trouble! So lets talk about unit of measure. Bitcoin as a unit of measure: I think Bitcoin is the universal language of economic truth. I think it will evolve as a unit of monetary energy. It makes sense in that way. Before Bitcoin, if you go back 50 years, people talked about ounces of gold. So I think a Bitcoin will be like an ounce of gold  an immutable, self-sovereign unit of economic energy  it makes sense to think of it like that! On the other hand, it will generally always be converted into local fiat in the political domicile in question for buying and selling things. And thats okay. There will be countries that allow stronger, better currencies. There will be countries thatll have weaker currencies and theyll crash their currencies and theyll replace their currencies. And as long as you HODL Bitcoin in your account youll be able to go into a new country. You know, Ive been to a country after they crashed their currency. Weve all been to Germany, they crashed their currency, we bought the new currency. Then they got rid of the Mark and it was the Euro, we bought the Euro! So the right way to think of it is as just a standard unit of economic energy or monetary energy and not overthink it, anything more than that. It can be interesting to say divide stock price by gold ounces  you can divide the cost of living by ounces of gold or by Bitcoin  its interesting! Its okay. Itll give you a pretty good read on inflation. If 1 Bitcoin buys you a car in the US but 1 Bitcoin buys you a skyscraper somewhere else then youll have relative cost of living. People did that with the Dollar, right? They used to say you could live in Mexico on the beach for $187 a month and live like a king. There are relative strengths. I think Bitcoin will be like that! But I dont think we need to stretch it any further than that. I think thats enough! I think ultimately, people focus too hard on medium of exchange, unit of measure, and they underestimate the value of Bitcoin as a store of value and as an asset. I think they undersell it and they dont do it justice! Because its so much better than every other asset! And then I think the entire community of crypto, its too much engaged in debates between the various crypto networks, with each other. Because Ill post something  Bitcoin is a great way to transmit energy into the future  and then the Ripple people will start fighting, and the Bitcoin Cash people, someone gets triggered and takes offense. The way I see it is: Crypto is a $300 Billion pond sitting on the beach next to a $300 Trillion ocean of capital, of energy. Thats 99.9% of all energy of humanity, is sitting in alt-assets, not altcoins! Not cryptocurrency! So I see all the crypto enthusiasts working on all the altcoins and theyre just trying to drag down Bitcoin. It reminds me of a bunch of crabs in a bucket and the buckets kind of hot or overheating and the one crab wants to crawl out and the other crabs just want to drag it back in instead of crawling on its back and getting out! Its like, all the crabs just keep pulling each other back into the bucket. Its totally self-sabotaging and it doesnt matter, because what they ought to be thinking is, How do we get $30 Trillion of the $300 Trillion to flow into our pond? In fact, they ought to be thinking, We want to go from $300 Billion to $3 Trillion, and from $3 Trillion to $30 Trillion, and from $30 Trillion to $300 Trillion. And the way youre gonna get there is not by attacking each other. The way youre gonna get there is by dividing the market and focusing! So if you want to be a cryptocurrency, well currency means you have to have a stable asset value because the IRS is gonna tax you to death if it changes. So Tether can be a currency, and it cannot change! Do we need one? I dont know. Its a centralized stablecoin, and maybe we need a decentralized stablecoin. The market will decide that. But thats a thing in its own. And if you want to build a crypto application, there are applications of things that people might want that Bitcoin doesnt do like: total privacy, or maybe you want to issue title or provenance, or maybe you want to do a decentralized exchange or wrap something or implement insurance or lending. Thats fine  DeFi. There are applications  have at it! Youd be better off to, say, Ethereum is 60% of the application market, Tether is 52% of the currency market  cryptocurrency and crypto app  and then Bitcoin is 95% of the crypto asset market. And if you believe in another type of asset, I dont think that its impossible to ever come up with one, I just think that right now the only clearly successful crypto asset is Bitcoin.", "image": null}

And then I describe the rest of the crypto-asset universe as liquid venture capital subjected to little, if any, due diligence! Some of them may succeed meaningful in markets orthogonal to money, but its very high risk. And the fact that anyone can spin up one of these assets in 15 minutes on the Ethereum blockchain, theres a very low barrier to entry, very low diligence, so invest accordingly! Id suggest no one  if youre gonna have a crypto-asset portion of your portfolio, I think the highest risk position you could ever be in is 80:20 Bitcoin to everything else.

I think we see it the same way. And I guess its a good segue just to general crypto theory: the emergence of magic in cyberspace. Whats a crypto network, whats a digital network? How do I view it? And you tell me if Im right or wrong. Im a newcomer  youve been around for a while. My view of crypto network is: A crypto network is a software application running on a decentralized network with a consensus mechanism, ideally proof of work, arguably maybe proof of stake or some other consensus mechanism that theorists would agree promotes decentralization and antifragility. And a digital network is a centralized network. Its a Facebook or Twitter or Google or Apple or whatevera more conventional client-server network. So as we look in the future of cyberspace were gonna see crypto networks and digital networks. Why would you want a crypto network? You want a crypto network for immortal sovereignty and antifragility. We know Bitcoin is doing that right now. If you want to convey humanity across time and space  especially across time  maybe across time and domain, domain might be even better than space. You know, crypto networks arent necessarily faster than digital networks for moving shit through space, but theyre better at moving it across domains, and the reason for that is that sometimes you have lowest common denominator regulatory or compliance constraints that cripple the innovation in a digital network. Apple Computer will never do certain things because theyre subject to the US law, even though they could do them in 98 countries! And so a crypto network may in fact develop faster across regulatory domains if digital networks are crippled. Theres obviously trade-offs between digital and crypto, and I think about it as like: Trust, Security, and Duration are attributes of crypto. Economy, Performance, Functionality, and Compliance are attributes of digital. If I want to do it cheap, its a billion times cheaper on a digital network. [42:37] If I want performance, its a million times faster on a digital network. If I want functionality, its likely much more functional. Theres nobody that would dispute that Apple Pay or Apple or Google, theyre beautiful, functional products. Apple or Google Maps. Trying to do Google Maps on a decentralized crypto network would probably be a disaster! And then compliance  digital networks are better at compliance. Sometimes we regret their compliance. They shut down stuff and they censor things. But theyre better at compliance. So the very things that make crypto attractive  Trust, Security, Duration  are purchased at the price of giving up Economy, Performance, Functionality and Compliance. The conclusion is: Some stuff makes better sense to be doing digitally, and other stuff maybe with crypto. Its early days, and the only obvious conclusion we both agree on is Bitcoin is a successful crypto network as a store of value. We know that. Everything else is an experiment and when it hits $100 Billion its not an experiment anymore. And we can debate whether its an experiment at $50 Billion, but I would say at $100 Billion its a thing, and its pretty clear. And it might be a thing we all know and recognize below that, but youd need a lot more education to determine that.", "image": null}

And this reminds me of an old quote, If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. So the centralized solution is kind of like going alone, because its just according to one single plan, it can innovate very quickly and move in a certain direction very quickly. Decision-making is concentrated. Whereas the decentralized solution has more of a dynamic equilibrium that lets it persist further across time. So the centralized solution is going to be really compliant, really fast, really innovative, but the decentralized solution is really only useful when you need censorship resistance. You need to know that it will persist across the maximum duration of time, and that no individual group or individual for that matter can shut it down or manipulate it. So Bitcoin is at the extreme end of that decentralized end of the spectrum, whereas something like Apple would be at the other end.", "image": null}

A vertebrate versus invertebrates. Different life  plants versus animals. Theyre different creatures. And they have different life spans! You want to live for 2,000 years? Or do you want to live for 80 years? One of them moves faster than the other, but one of them is more vulnerable than the other. I think from a human point of view, the real question for humans is: Do you want to put your trust in Man, trust in the organization, trust in a company, trust in a government? And/or: Do you want to put your trust in a crypto network? And were gonna solve our problems with a segmentation, mixture of these trusts. Were probably not gonna put the functionality into Bitcoinin a total decentralized proof of work network  that will do what Amazon does or Uber does or Pandora or YouTube does. Probably not! But do we really need to? We probably dont need to. So when we think about the crypto industry segmentation, I think you really want to divide and conquer. A crypto network is a life form. And I think thats different. I mean theres a genetic encoding in a crypto network, and its very different than solving the problem with a human being or solving the problem even with a digital network. When you design the protocol, Bitcoin, and you let it go, it becomes a life form and it multiplies and all these nodes spread and all these miners spread. And you cant easily pull the genie back in the bottle and re-engineer the genetics of it when youve released it into the wild. In fact, you would almost say that once plankton is spread out to dominate all the ecosystem  if God had a better idea  he created that and made those minnows! Or he created bacteria  he created a new species. You have a better idea? Create something different, and if that something different is in the same energy ecosystem as the plankton its not gonna make it! [48:01] If you take a bird, the bird can coexist with a deer, but its hard to create two apex predator birds and put them in the same space at the same timeone of them eats the other one! One apex predator creature. And thats the same thing with crypto, I think. You gotta think of it as an evolution of a new life force in cyberspace, and the genetic code is of paramount importance! So if you really hope to be successful  and this is my opinion  when you release the privacy coin, you need to say, This is for this thing, and this is what it is, and were going to get it just right and were gonna let it breathe and let it live and were not gonna mess with it or monkey with it. And were not gonna decide that we wanted the monkey to have wings and also have gills and swim. And if Im watching TV and I see these cool antler things and I want to put the antlers on it! You cant be a technology-tinkering enthusiast with a crypto. You have to have more of the mindset of, Its the crazy guy in the lab coat in the laboratory creating a new kind of life, virus, creature. Its like you get one shot, and its at a lab  and youre done! You cant get it back! And so you should be aware of just how important it is. Its a protocol. Life is a strand of DNA and that DNA is going to go and its going to do whatever its going to do. Youre creating life. And so how devastating is it for God to say, I created human beings. I made a mistake. Im gonna recall them and then tinker and then do a human being 2.0. Its a problem, right? [50:04] In the Bible, the biblical analogy is the flood where everybody just gets killed. Or some crazy stuff in the Garden of Eden. But with things like Ethereum, right? Youve got Ethereum 1.0 and now you try to do Ethereum 2.0  youd almost be better off just to do something different as opposed to like retrofit something, because its going back and trying to force-fit the DNA. You could do it with a digital network. Its okay if youre running on a single server and you can throw a switch and everybody switches with it. But the whole point of a decentralized life form is that theyre all different and they all get to make their own decisions! And if you can order them to do something, it doesnt feel that decentralized anymore, does it?", "image": null}

It is the purpose of the crypto network to be an asset, and Bitcoin clearly is. And then Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshis Vision and the rest are trying to be. It seems pretty clear that Bitcoin is 9394% of all the assets and the other ones are probably going to zero! And the only way you dont go to zero is: You have to be differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates you. Its a species, right? I cant be almost like a bunny rabbit, I need to be a wolf! I need to be different than a bunny rabbit! And its an important caveat: Differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates. In other words: Differentiated in a way such that Nature gives you an advantage in natural selection. So taking Bitcoin, forking it, and making it do transactions 10 times faster isnt good enough because youre a million times slower than the other way to do transactions. So thats just not a genetic mutation that works. Its an example of a faulty genetic mutation that kills the carrier  its an extinction-level mutation. Genetic mutations happen all the time in Nature. Most of them are mistakes. But some of them might work! If I can stand up on two feet and if my eyes start to work 10 times better than your eyes and I can fashion missiles then maybe thats gonna work for me. And maybe I will procreate. So its not impossible to have a genetic mutation on Bitcoin that would be naturally advantageous. Its not impossible. Its just, the ones you look at right now, like, what do you have? I mean, transaction speed? Thats really no good. Privacy? Its a regulatory threat and so therefore its probably a nice thing but its a bullseye in its forehead which means that when the regulators go to shut down crypto exchanges the first thing theyll do is pass a law against that, right? And so, give me an example of a mutation on Bitcoin that would make it a distinct asset as a store of value that would deserve to have its own life?", "image": null}

Its not impossible to conceptualize that maybe there would be one, but right now it looks like Bitcoin is 94% of the crypto-asset market. You cant include Ethereum because although its proof of work now its going to proof of stake, and they dont even have an intellectual commitment to be proof of [work 55:04]. And proof of stake isits not clear to me that proof of stake is intellectually defensible over the long term. Its not proven. It seems like it may be defective as an idea, right? Its like an example  were back to this issue: Its like I want to hobble the antelopes. Its like somebody complained were using too much energy! Its almost like the environmentalists took over and theyve decided that theyre just mad that someones using too much energy so they want to pass a law to stop it. But its a law against Mother Nature, and its [brooding 55:44] to hobble the antelope.

So theyre destined to [hugely 56:04] to go to zero. So then we go to cryptocurrencies. Thats a simple one  stablecoins. People go ballistic if you say theyre cryptocurrencies because everybody wants Bitcoin to be a cryptocurrency! But if the definition of currency is money that you can legally spend in a country without incurring taxes, Bitcoin is not a currency, but Tether is! Becauseits kind of simple  read the IRS tax code. Youll find, most places on Earth, theyre gonna tax it as an asset. And theres nothing wrong with that! In fact, thats better. Its actually a mistake: Why would you want to create a short-term currency thats a billion times more expensive to implement computationally than the other way? Its like, the only reason youd want to do something a billion times more expensive is for immortality  immortal sovereignty! Thats a good reason. But youve got that. If you had that on 99% of your assets 99.9% of the time, then youre good. Then you could afford to have a little bit of risk in order to have a billion times faster performance on a digital network. So thats currencies. The only reason for a cryptocurrency is for regulatory arbitrage or maybe innovation due to decentralization. If you can make the argument that were gonna innovate faster because were governed by the laws of Singapore and people in Malta can use a Singaporean cryptocurrency and its not technically illegal, its just a hundred times better because were able to tap into that regulatory arbitrage opportunity, you could call it a [free? 57:55] market, then I think, Okay!

In theory when you cross the crosswalk, if the red light failed, couldnt you get slammed into with a truck and killed? Okay, so are you gonna take the position that were gonna have to build flyovers on every crosswalk in the world? Eh, pretty expensive! You know? So what will happen there? I dont know, but it seems to me that Binance is doing just fine as a centralized exchange. And it seems that Square works fine as a digital client application. And if Apple Computer announced that you could send Bitcoin or cash via Apple Pay or iMessage tomorrow, I think a lot of people would be pretty happy to do that! No one would be complaining about it! And it really comes down to this issue of: Economy  its a million times cheaper, Performance  its a million times faster, Functionality  its a million times more functional, and Compliance  theyre probably more compliant in the country youre in! So if you can do it on a digital network, you probably will! When you think about crypto, you really have to ask this question: What is so important that I want immortal sovereignty? What is so important? And certainly my life force. If you said to me, Michael, Im gonna take all of your energy and Im going to protect it and Im going to fulfill your wishes from now to 1,000 years from now  I think thats worth it! Thats a religion! Thats a crypto! You know, I have a park. Id like for the park to be trimmed and the trees to be kept nice and Id like for the park to be beautiful for the next 1,000 years and itll cost $1 Million a year. And so if I put $50 Million into endowment and it generates 2% yield, then I could reasonably say to Robert, Robert, why dont you take my $50 Million endowment and put it into Bitcoin. And then it becomes the question of: How am I gonna see my wishes through for 1,000 years? Well the current way you would do it is you would create an institution like the Rockefeller Institution or the Hughes Institute. [1:04:08] And you trust human beings. What were really talking about is: Were talking about the crypto-asset network of Bitcoin taking the base layer and holding all the monetary energy for 1,000 years. Or 100 years, if you think 1,000 years is crazy  well go 100 years. And then were talking about a digital network. Maybe its gardners.com or Amazon will probably do it because theyll probably do everything by the time we get through the decade. There will be nothing that theyre not doing! Let me make it easier: Lets just say I want to send flowers to everyone in my family on their birthday for the next 100 years with a little note from me telling them how much I love them  thats a simpler thing. I endow an account with Bitcoin, I create an Amazon account, I wire it up with flowers, I create some kind of mechanism so that when children are born they get added to the family unit, and the thing drips out a little bit of monetary energy in Bitcoin, converts to fiat, buys the flowers for $187,000 a dozen roses in the year 2047, and it ships them for the person, and I die happy, and for the next 100 or 1,000 years, flowers get delivered to people in the Saylor family line because that was my last will and testament! And how would I do it if I was John D. Rockefeller 100 years ago? I would have a crapload of assets, probably a lot of gold and stock  and he owned every oil company and theyre still around  and then you would put some of that into a foundation. A non-profit foundation, because you need tax-free, tax-advantaged. Thats why you need to go non-profit. By the way, all of your capital gains become tax free, tax-advantaged, and all your income becomes tax-advantaged, right? So thats a good idea. And then you have a board of governance and you have 5 advisors and they appoint a money manager and they appoint a business manager and when one of them retires they have a selection committee process that puts someone else. Were probably on the 7th generation of advisors to the Rockefeller Institute. By the way, John D. Rockefeller created the University of Chicago. Its still running. Rockefeller created a lot of stuff thats still running! Rockefeller University. So I can do it the old-fashioned way, but to do it well youre probably talking about $100 Million of assets and a $5 Million a year operating budget. You get down to $12 Million its not really  $5 Million a year is the minimum. Your best bet is you have to become a university, a religion, a church, or a non-profit, a Hughes Institute. So thats the way that you get immortal sovereignty, or like some long-range sovereignty. Another standard way people do it is like, Rockefeller bought up all the land on the Hudson River and he gives it to the state of New York, turn it into a state park or national park like Grand Teton National Park, and you get the federal government, the state government to agree to fund it in perpetuity per the Smithsonian Institution. The problem with all those things is that sometimes you just cant even trust the governments, right? But your best bet is you lay it off on a state or a federal government, and thats okay until the government fails or it reneges on something or other. The bottom line is that its not really within the grasp of a small or mid-size business or the individual. What is YouTube? YouTube allows you to become your own TV station! So what are we talking about here? The clich, Be your own bank, if we look at it a different way its like, Im a normal person, I endow my own monetary energy into Bitcoin, I plug it into to some digital network, I give the keys to someone I trust  family member, heir  maybe I do multisig, right? Instead of having 5 people on a board  if you have 5 people on a board of an endowment with $100 Million or $1 Billion in the endowment, theyre kept honest by filing annual tax forms with the IRS. And in theory they could be personally liable if they defraud the foundation or abuse their fiduciary trust. But you know its kind of like a 20th Century idea! A better idea would be: I put the money into Bitcoin and I have 3 or 5 digital keys. And it takes 3 out of the 5 to vote on anything. And every 3 months they have to register that theyre online and of healthy mind and spirit, and if someone stops registering then that remaining 4 automatically appoint a 5th, and whenever anybody retires they automatically transfer their key, and then what Ive done is Ive dematerialized an endowment, board of directors, corporation, institution. And its just become maybe a simple application in cyberspace plugged into a base layer of monetary energy. And its doing something! Whatever the something is. And so thats a combination of (1) people and (2) digital networks and (3) crypto networks in order to allow people to achieve their hopes and desires over long periods of time.", "image": null}

Okay so you appoint 3 trustees of the Breedlove Institute, you endow it with some amount of Bitcoin. You live a fine life, you depart, and their rules are: Every 10 years they have to find someone to replace them. You put your own term limits in there! By the way, you could put all sorts of rules in. You could say that everyone that actually reads my stuff and passes the test can vote on who the 5 trustees are gonna be. Or, you cant even be a trustee unless youve watched and read everything and understood everything and passed my quiz that I left for you. What if Ludwig von Mises left all of his stuff in cyberspace and wed need to read all his stuff and pass it and pass an oral exam by him in order to become a fellow. And if we become a fellow were invited into the academy of Austrian Economists, and that goes on to all eternity. And then the academy adds to the body of knowledge and they can upgrade the protocols and they can upgrade the tests and they can pass the flame down from generation to generation and the entire thing becomes antifragile and its the religion of Austrian Economics! Im thinking the guild system. If you want something to be an immortal sovereign crypto network, then you think like the guilds. Its gotta be something that people are so passionate about theyll pass it down from parent to child, father to son, mother to daughter, master to student. There are things like that: schools of martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, religions, etc. And the medieval guilds were like that! Maybe there would be a  for example, I like environmental causes. What if I had a park and I said, Well people have to go in and they have to work in the park and support the park, but the park is this private/public entity where you can be a member and you get to use it but only if you can contribute to it and protect it. And then I endow it and it becomes a self-sovereign entity for 1,000 years. Its like a park-owners association, right?", "image": null}

Or, I want to endow a professorship of Austrian Economics  but then someone takes over the university and so they divert the money to buy a new hot dog truck. SoIm dead  how do I make sure that someone doesnt, that they really fulfill my last dying wish? How do I make sure? Well I can do it if I have a Rockefeller Institute and they hold the purse strings and they dole it out annually and then they watch. But then I have to actually have a bunch of people that I trust that 100 years from now will remember what my wishes were! And maybe nobody cares about that. Its a challenge for people. I went to Naples this year. And if you go to Naples, you go into the port, you have all these superyachts in the port, and very very wealthy people on the superyachts. But if you walk out of the port theres puddles on the floor and theres this park in the middle of Naples right next to the port and it runs about 10 blocks. And 50 years ago it was beautiful and the jewel of Naples and it was like Central Park and everyone could come there and enjoy the day. Now if you walk through it, all the buildings are spray-painted, theyre all closed, theres pooling stinking water, no grass grows, its just mud. It looks like something 40 years after the apocalypse! Its in the middle of like the third largest city in Italy. Theres money everywhere, and yet somehow neither the municipal government nor the state nor the federal government of Italy, nor any wealthy person, can manage to come up with $100,000 Euros a year to water the grass and mow the lawn. In the middle of a city of a million people  the public jewel the city, the single most important piece of real estate in the entire cityis suffering from a tragedy of the commons. Now I ask myself: If I was that wealthy person and I wanted to bring that park to life, if you wanted to do it top-notch you need $1 Million Euros a year. You want to do spectacular? $10 Million Euros a year. If you want to just mow the lawn and water it and keep it from being a stinking, mud-infesting war zone? $100,000 Euros a year. How do I actually endow that park without having the money hijacked by whoever hijacked the money? Because obviously none of the economic energy is making it to that park in the middle of Naples. It might be a more worthy cause just giving a third of my money to the government as tax on my death, or two-thirds when I die for them to  whatever theyre doing, like, What could you say about a civilization that cant keep its central park in its most important city in the province from being a stinking, post-apocalyptic zone?", "image": null}

So people have wishes. They have a hard time realizing their wishes. Theres a lot of ways to do it, and the theoretical magic way to do it is: I create a program on a crypto network in cyberspace, it runs on a blockchain network  nobody can stop it, ever, its unstoppable code  its literally a magic spell! A less intense way is: I power it with crypto network and I use a combination of people and digital networks to do it. I think ultimately people can achieve what they want in a variety of ways. If I want to be fed, I can feed myself by hunting a deer, hunting some chickens, growing some corn  these are all different ways to achieve what you want. The real key is: I need to have mastered the technology of hunting, cultivating animals, wildlife, and farming. And if I have all three of those technologies on my fingertips that I can mix and match, then I can actually do something interesting. I think thats the potential here. We talked about: Money is power. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. So if you apply advanced technology to money, then you can give someone magic power. The source of magic power is providing an instruction into the digital and crypto network space and powering it with crypto network space such that you cast a spell in the future, or cast a curse into the future when youre long gone. Thats real magic, right? Like, casting a curse 30 years after I die  thats impressive magic! Less interesting but more practical is: I just want to cast a spell while Im alive. And the magic spell I would cast, were I a magician, is I would go to that park in Naples and Id wave my hand and it would become a beautiful paradise with gorgeous trees and nice grass and water flowing and cleanliness and safety and free ice cream cones for the kids and flowers and happy music and concerts on the green. And it would be like that forever, because thats my magic! By the way, in fantasy, the great magicians, the demi-gods, the powerful wizards, they have magic power  they can do that! And the more powerful they are, the longer the spell lasts. So if I have $1 Million, I can do it for a year. If I have $100 Million, I can do it forever. If I have $1 Billion, I can allocate 10% of my power to do it there forever. Magic power, right? Money is power. You got enough money, you can snap your fingers, materialize a jet, itll fly you to Tokyo on 10 hours notice. Itll cost you about $250,000, if thats how you want to expend your energy. If you dont have enough energy it doesnt matter. If you dont have $250,000  right? The other part in those magic stories is the mere mortal that wants that same trip, their life force is sucked out of them and theyre aged 82 years and they die! If I take a middle-class person making $72,000 a year and they need to fly from New York to Tokyo for $250,000, thats all the savings theyre ever gonna have! I just sucked their life force out of them to cast that spell. And so how much power do you have? And how much magic can you bring to bear? Look, John D. Rockefeller had magic. He just did it the old fashioned way. And his son did, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. They went to all the beautiful places on the Earth, they bought them all up, and then they ended up turning them into national parks. The US Virgin Islands is a Rockefeller Park. St. John, they bought. Acadia, they bought a lot of Mount Desert Island, made it a national park. Grand Tetons, they bought all that land, made it a national park. Most of the land up and down the Hudson River  between they and J.P. Morgan  they bought it and made it a state park. They were casting spells.", "image": null}

The senator from Rhode Island. So I think that in a nutshell is my views on crypto. I think ultimately were moving into an exciting world where people are gonna be able to achieve great things with a variety of digital networks and crypto networks. What we can see right now for sure is: There is at least one successful crypto network  Bitcoin  there are many successful dominant digital networks  YouTube, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc., plenty of them and the future is gonna be defined by these networks, and you just gotta decide whats the best tool for the problem? You can solve problems with people. I can pick up the phone, I can call you and I can say, Robert, buy me $100 Million worth of Bitcoin! And I solve the problem with a person. Or I can solve the problem with a digital network. I can go online on Binance and I can start like typing and trading, and I can buy $100 Million worth of Bitcoin. Or I could solve the problem with Uniswap  with a decentralized total crypto network. What will happen? The market will determinewhat we know is that over time, what was done by people will start to be done with digital networks, and what was done by digital networks may in fact float into crypto networks to the extent that sovereign immortality is worth the trouble. And if youre gonna make a crypto network  if theyre just doing it for regulatory arbitrage its probably got a 10-year life span and its shaky  because whos gonna lay down in front of a tank for something like the difference between Binance and Uniswap? Would you sacrifice your life to try to trade on Uniswap instead of Binance? Because I wouldnt! Let me tell you what theyll lay down in front of a tank for: Theyll lay down in front of a tank for Freedom, for their Religious Values, for the Future of their Family, for the Future of their Ideology. If they have a passionate belief, they will lay down in front of a tank in order to defend it. The principles of Science and Justice and Humanity and Truth. Not everybody! But you dont need everybody! You need the keepers of the flame. You need the maximalists. The 1% who are willing to fight and die for the principles. We hold these truths to be self-evident. We didnt come up with it here today in this call. It was a basic truth that founded a lot of things including the United States of America. And if you go back to the Roman Republic, there were a lot of Romans when the Roman Republic was healthy, and they were willing to fight and die for Roman principles. To a certain extent, a lot of good Romans assassinated Julius Caesar because they thought they were fighting for Roman principles. And a lot of wars were fought over it. So if you really want a crypto to be successful over 100 years, the technology is only a part of it, right? Its the ideology paired with the technology. And youre gonna have to have an ideology that is so pure and so straightforward that people will fight to the death to defend the ideology. And thats why Im probably not gonna sacrifice my life for the 13th iteration on smart contracts! Its not that important! On the other hand, if you tell me that were about to suck all of the economic energy out of the civilization and plunge ourselves into the Dark Ages, then I think Ill fight for it. Thats worth fighting for.", "image": null}

That was Episode 8, and man! Just another big, deep dive into Bitcoin and its implications! Globally, really. So we started the episode out talking about how divinity of engineering. As Saylor mentioned, the beaver  which is the mascot for MIT  the reason the beaver is the mascot of this engineering-focused school, MIT, is because the beaver is really special! He actually goes into nature and harvests materials and re-sculpts the flow of rivers, frankly, by damming it and using his wits and ability to build a habitable structure for himself and his family when he goes to reproduce. So the beaver ends up being this symbol for this divine quality  that really life has  which is engineering. This divine quality of engineering has found its highest expression in Man. At least as far as we know, we are the animal most capable of harnessing this quality that the ancients would call the Logos, which is the ability to confront the chaos of nature, dissect it with the categorical capabilities of our mind and our words, communicate about its properties and qualities to learn about nature, and basically convert this unexplored territory into explored territory, and convert chaos into good and habitable order. And this is a really deep and ancient idea, but its something fundamental to life and to humans. And civilization itself we can think of as just a bubble of this habitable order amid the unlivable entropy of the universe. And you can see this even in like the Southeast United States, there were areas in say Mississippi that were just not habitable whatsoever prior to the invention of the air conditioner! So thats maybe one extreme example but there were literally places  geographic locations on Earth  that we simply could not live until we became sufficiently advanced technologically. And Saylor has a great quote on this. He says, Humans are divine when they engineer a better habitat for themselves and those they love through their intellect. So again this to me points back to work, which Bitcoinas weve discussed  its money rooted in proof of work as gold was. Work itself is a noble pursuit, right? It is the means by which we convert chaos into good and useful order, and I would argue that it elevates our timelessness. Its actually allowing us to accomplish greater results with less efforts in terms of making productivity gains. Its also lowering our time preference, making us more long-term oriented. And in this process we develop more morality, more selflessness even, and we also develop greater survivability as a species. So when the entropy of nature inevitably creeps in, we have the ability to respond to it. If theres a natural disaster or something out of sort, we can harness resources from other pockets of civilization and channel them into the affected areas such that they can recuperate. So I thought that was just a really interesting topic, and it points towards the instrumentality of Bitcoin in helping us better focus on this divine quality. Bitcoin really is money purpose-built for entrepreneurial experimentation which involves engineering and problem-solving. Whereas you could look at something like fiat currency: much more based on bureaucratic theft. Were talking about individuals and organizations that add no value to the productive economy and just siphon value off of those that do [out in 1:35:30] the world and engineer. So in that sense, by re-enabling and re-energizing work itself, we could view Bitcoin as a form of divine money, in a way. And then we got into Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. And in 2017 during the Bitcoin Cash fork wars, there was a bit of a delusion in related to this word cash in the whitepaper where Satoshi called Bitcoin originally peer-to-peer cash. And the thought was  at least by the Roger Vers of the world who represented Bitcoin Cashthat Bitcoin needed to be used in day-to-day transactions. What this is ignorant of actually is the original meaning of the word cash, which comes from the French word caisse, which meant money box. And this was used as a term in the 19th Century to indicate final settlement. So it was a bearer-asset money. Physical gold, physical silver was said to be cash. And only in the modern age have we sort of repurposed this word to mean the government debt certificates that we trade with today and call money. And knowing what a genius Satoshi was, I am confident he was clear on this meaning of cash, and did not mean Bitcoin needed to be used as a day-to-day medium of exchange to proliferate. And by the way, even if he did, it doesnt matter, because the market selects the purpose and utility of a tool. So Bitcoin is being selected  has been selected  by the market as a store of value. And thats the direction we think itll keep going. So the magic of Bitcoin if you will  as weve discussed in earlier episodes  is this ability to transfer monetary energy in a loss-minimized way. So you can send energy across time and space with minimal loss, essentially. And thats whats important, not the ability or speed or low transaction fee to move it at a high frequency  it just doesnt make any sense. So to Saylors point on that, the Bitcoin network is optimized for suviveability  thats what decentralization is, is that its a very slow and inefficient database, but with that slowness and inefficiency comes maximal redundancy. And with that redundancy comes resistance to large attacks, specifically nation-state level attacks, which would be the most powerful organizations in the world today. So if you needed a medium for high frequency transaction, so youre always going to get more economy and efficiency by moving to a centralized system like PayPal, Venmo, Apple Pay, Visa, whatever. Because the database only needs to be updated once. Versus Bitcoin has to be replicated everywhere and nowhere across all nodes and miners. So thats the trade-off and well get into more of that shortly. But in a nutshell I like the description Saylor uses that Bitcoin is a low frequency medium of exchange, meaning you only need to move it occasionally, maybe never if you custody it correctly. But its a high frequency store of value. So every time youre HODLing, youre using it. So the people who argue that Bitcoin has no utility, they dont understand this economic principle whatsoever. And further to that, even if you absolutely wanted to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, most tax codes in the world today are hostile to that. Theyll actually trigger capital gains realization at each transaction. [1:39:31] So it really suppresses its use as a medium of exchange. And another way to think about this  it gets a little more complicated  but actually when youre holding something as a store of value, trades are not just with other people. Trades are also with ourselves. Like infinite slices of our future selves. So every time you choose to hold cash or hold Bitcoin or hold gold  cash in its original sense  and not trade it, you are basically trading with your future self. So you are giving away the opportunity that the cash could have otherwise been traded for  whatever its cash value in the market is, it could go out and buy you X assets  youre forgoing those assets and choosing to hold the optionality of cash. Whereas those assets may have real yield! They may be productive assets, rent-generating real estate or whatever it may be, whereas hard money doesnt actually create yield. So youre actuallythe most trades you do in life are not actually with present others but they are with your future self. All these infinite slices of your future self. Every action or inaction even is a set of trades with those future slices of yourself. So we could look at the actual store of value function truly being much more important as a medium of exchange than a present medium of exchange with present others. So thats just an interesting way to conceive of money, that its something that youre holding onto to have maximum optionality into the future, and that holding is a trade with you even though its not a trade with others. And this also dovetailed into why Saylor chooses not to compensate people in Bitcoin and why he thinks its a bad idea to do so, because again if youre using it primarily as a store of value you may not sell it ever or for say at least 100 years. By choosing to compensate people in Bitcoin youre accelerating that tax bill 100 years into the future, so thats a really bad idea. Youre also increasing the accounting complexity of the business which would be the payer and the payee. They both need to mark Bitcoin to market at each point of transaction. Youd also be forcing  say if youre compensating your employee with Bitcoin  youre forcing them to sell it later to actually cover the tax bills generated as a result, so that doesnt make a lot of sense. In a nutshell, as Saylor said, the ethos of Bitcoin is self-responsibility. So you should pay and settle in whatever the generally accepted medium of exchange is, the one the tax code is not hostile against, which tends to be currency. And then if you have savings  you have excess currency or excess assets  you would, as Saylor does, sweep them into your savings or your treasury for long-term storage. Thats the optimal and intelligent and low-complexity strategy. We get into a bit about how optionality itself is freedom. The more options you have the more free you are. And this has direct impact on the stability of society. Saylor quoted Robert Heiland who said, An armed society is a polite society. So to tie that back to Bitcoin and capital its like, when people have this option of capital flight  they have this perpetual option to move their money across domain, across time, across custodian  and settle finality nearly instantly, that governments and institutions and service providers, theyre gonna tend to be more respectful because the customer holding the capital has such a high degree of optionality. So you could think about this too: When you go to the amusement park, the food and drink cost in an amusement park tend to be really high. A soda that you may pay $3 for at your local convenience store might be $810 in that amusement park. And its because the amusement park has whats called a captive audience premium. You have no other choice. You have no other options to buy food or drink once you are within the bounds of that amusement park, and they can effectively charge you monopoly-style prices. And if you look at Bitcoin capital through that lens its kind of removing that captive audience premium that legacy institutions or nation states tended to have over users. And we could say that if users have the ability to move the money whenever they want, they dont actually need to, its just the fact that that option exists keeps everyone honest, keeps everyone listening to one anothers preferences, because no one wants the capital to move. So the point of this is that a symmetry of options, a symmetry of optionality between buyer and seller and stability of the rules and the protocols through which they interact, this is the bedrock of peace. This is what preserves peace. But when you get asymmetries, when one group has a lot of optionality over another, thats when you get predatory treatment. And I would say central banking falls much more into that model, where they get this perpetual call option on society basically, that they can allocate cash into businesses, the shareholders values being increased, the dividends being paid, and if theres ever a shock to the economy and the institutions that have deployed that capital into risky positions get wiped out, well the central bank just siphons more value from the productive economy through printing money and allocates again. So its a Heads I Win, Tails You Lose situation for central banks over productive economies. So Bitcoin is just eliminating this, this captive audience premium or asymmetry of optionality. Another way to think about this too is  to get back into Bitcoin is Money  we can actually consider the monetary premium itself on an asset as its optionality value. So the more tradable an asset is, the more a component of its market value is its expected future exchange. So for instance if ammo has a very specific use  it can be put into a gun and fired and a gun can be used to kill people or animals or whatever  but if in an environment of ammunition scarcity, people may also be willing to trade other goods and services for that ammunition, so that ammunition will start to trade at a premium not just for its utility value  not that its utility value has increased necessarily  but that its exchange value or its optionality value has increased. The extreme example of this would be gold. Gold has a  I think were at an almost $12 Trillion market cap for gold  the industrial demand for that is less than $2 Trillion, I want to say its closer to $1 Trillion. The rest of that demand or the rest of that market cap for gold is reservation demand for gold as money. It best fulfilled the properties of money which made it maximally exchangeable across space and time. In that lens too we could say that Bitcoin is like the worlds first pure money. Its pure monetary premium. Theres not really an industrial use beneath it. Some have argued that actually the transaction network was kind of the original utility that bootstrapped its monetary premium into existence. Maybe you could make that argument. But the point is that its a tool of pure optionality, because its pure monetary premium. Whereas you could look at things that are less tradable, where a much larger part of their market value would be their use, their industrial use value versus their trading value. So money exists on this gradient is the point. Something thats very not-tradable, high non-fungible, very specific  purple telescopes or something weird like that  itd be valued just on its use, mostly just on its use. Not on its future expected exchange value. But something like Bitcoin and money itself  at the other end of the spectrum  is valued on its expected future exchange value. I think it was Naval said that Money is the bubble that never pops. Because this delta between market and industrial use value has been called a bubble by some people. But what it actually is underlying that is the value of the monetary properties giving rise to that exchangability. So that got us into Bitcoin as a unit of account. Saylor had a great quote on this. He expects that, Bitcoin will be a universal language of economic truth. I fully agree! It is the predictability of the supply of money that gives rise to its utility and pricing of goods and services with it. Thats what gold was, it had the most predictable supply of any monetary metal and thats why all of the liquidity and market capitalization coalesced to gold. And thats too for that reason we used to think actually in ounces of gold. Even dollars themselves represented ounces of gold originally. The time and energy of market actors that produce every good and service in the world, this tool  money, or gold  most closely mapped onto the absolute scarcity of time and energy. So gold was the supply curve that was closest to the absolute immutable perfectly scarce supply curve of time and energy. And this gave it the ability to basically generate prices that were generally the most stable  not saying that they enforced stability  but they tended to be most stable because gold had the lowest and most predictable inflation which also meant prices were more useful in calculation. They werent fluctuating wildly over time. And they were communicable. So we could actually start to just think in ounces of gold for goods and services instead of needing to think in all these countless exchange ratios  how many chairs a car is worth or whatever it may have been. So I agree that Bitcoin is gonna go that way. But as far as where it is today  I love this point  Saylor was saying theres a lot of in-fighting in the crypto community about is Bitcoin gonna be the thing or Ethereum or this or that, but its all essentially pointless. The crypto-asset ecosystem at the time we recorded was around a $300 Billion pond sitting next to a $300 Trillion ocean of assets which a lot of them are just intended to hold value over time. Store of value assets  gold, bonds, real estate  all fall into this ocean. And thats where our energy should be focused is actually carving a little spill-away from the ocean into the pond here, not competing amongst ourselves because frankly as weve covered in previous episodes, Bitcoin is just highly resistant to disruption as money. Its not like other crypto-assets wont succeed in something orthogonal to money, something thats not in the market for money. Theres technology that may have other use cases, theres a lot of theory out there. But today its just not proven! So I agree completely that our focus as educators or ambassadors for Bitcoin needs to be geared towards those still holding and interacting with these other alternative stores of value so they can understand why Bitcoin is possibly the sole store of value asset for the 21st Century, the only way you could successfully transfer value 100 years into the future with the least loss. So I agree with that completely. We then jumped into crypto versus digital networks. Again crypto network we can think of as a decentralized consensus model. And this is using Saylors nomenclature: The digital network would be centralized consensus. So just sort of one entity or decision-making body deciding. And there are different use cases for the two and there are different trade-offs between them, clearly. So crypto network would be useful for establishing what Saylor calls immortal sovereignty or antifragility, which means that they are able to persist over time. Decentralized crypto networks have a high degree of survivability and they impart properties like trust-minimization, security, and duration. So you dont need to trust the centralized decision-making body. Instead you trust the aggregate self-interest of all market actors in a centralized network. And this is clearly gold or this is Bitcoin. Again gold  its not built on cryptography per se, but the inability of producers to create gold in a lab basically meant that the whole world was decentralized around gold as money. There was no political actor that could control it until central banks accumulated a large stake in the supply and started manipulating it in the gold derivatives market which we talked about before. On the other hand of the spectrum from a crypto network is a digital network. Which as opposed to survivability is useful for squeezing efficiency out of a system, eliminating redundancy. Where a decentralized network is gonna be fully redundantyoure talking about all these nodes and miners all over the world all running a copy of Bitcoin and updating all the time, so its a huge expenditure of energy to establish your redundancy  a digital network is gonna just have one record base that can be updated very quickly, very low latency, very low redundancy. So the properties that it imparts are Economy, Performance, Functionality, and Compliance. And to draw back to  where you could say gold is decentralized money  you could say fiat is more like a centralized money. So because gold was expensive to move across space, we could introduce this centralized database on top of it called fiat currency that let us do ledger entries really quickly in gold. So we picked all of this transactability across space but we introduced this attack vector for intermediaries that actually compromised golds store of value function over time. The only market-proven crypto network in the world today is non-state digital store of value Bitcoin  everything else is theoretical. This is not to say that actually a digital network cant evolve into a crypto network! It kind of reminded me of our earlier discussion of the Steel Age where newly charted industrial spaces tend to have monopolists won out in the beginning, and then those monopolists set standards, and then over time that market becomes commodified and tends back toward a more freely competitive domain based on this standard. So its as if a digital network could establish certain protocol standards for a decentralized network and then turn over the keys so to speak to the market. And then if there was sufficient demand for whatever utility its providing, it could become decentralized over time if you handled it correctly. We havent really seen that yet. Weve seen some attempts at it but I dont think weve seen it done really cleanly yet. But this evolution, a successful evolution from a digital to a crypto network, would require sufficient differentiation. One that would end up being useful as a competitive advantage in this market-driven natural selection process. Again I think Bitcoin has already run and won the race for money, so it would have to be a different market. And its difficult! Itd be really difficult to accomplish this differentiation given Bitcoins capacity to absorb a competitors feature set. In a biological sense we call this horizontal gene transfer. Where  Brandon Quittem has written and talked about this  Mycelium has this ability when it encounters a threat in the environment, if it neutralizes the threat and consumes it, a competing Mycelium or an insect or whatever, it can actually digest its genetic code and incorporate that information into its own genetic code! So we typically think of animals having vertical gene transfer from parent to offspring, but theres something more competitive in nature  this horizontal gene transfer where you can just slurp up genetic material from competitors. And Bitcoin exhibits that in the digital domain! So the point is that the differentiation necessary for a digital network to evolve into a crypto network would have to overcome this horizontal gene transfer of Bitcoin as well, which would otherwise just absorb it and render the attempted evolution unnecessary. So finally we got into this concept of immortal sovereignty which I thought was just incredibly interesting. [1:59:33] You can think about this as channeling ones preferences beyond ones own life, and this is not a new idea actually. Saylor gave this general example of: If he wanted to buy flowers for everyone in his family for the next 100 years on their birthday, how would he accomplish that? He drew on examples from John D. Rockefeller and he said, Rockefeller would have established  using the tech of his time  to accomplish this immortal sovereignty by either establishing a non-profit foundation, an endowment, a university, or possibly even a national state park. But this necessitated really big numbers and was limited to just a few ultra-rich people that could do it. And again these are  when Rockefeller was alive I guess almost 100 years ago now, youre talking about $100 Million in assets with $5 Million a year operating budget in 1920 Dollars. So big, big numbers were necessary to achieve this immortal sovereignty that Bitcoin delivers to us in a much more cost-effective way today! Additionally, no matter what you set up  foundation, endowment, university  you would still encounter this counterparty risk because youd have to trust the institution, youd have to trust the government protecting the institution. But Bitcoin gives us an interesting thing which is a monetary layer that enables us to dematerialize these institutions but still achieve similar  this immortal sovereignty if you will. And it does because you can actually assign the trustees  in say a multisig setup  keys to the funds to accomplish the aims of the digital foundation. But because their property rights wouldnt be exposed to counterparty risk in the form of an institution or a government, they would actually gain a great deal of dynamism to roll with or get through geopolitical changes such that they could preserve the original mission of that institution. So you could think of it as immortal sovereignty at just a much lower cost! Which I think just speaks to the grander vision of Bitcoin, right? Its like: Why do we have these stories like the nation state and universities organizing us, and what is possible when we instead maximize the sovereignty of the individual? Like how relevant do those institutions remain? The other example he gave is if you wanted to host your website reading material for 1,000 years into the future, you could code all kinds of interesting rules around that! Maybe requiring people to pass a test and become a certified student of your knowledge, and then maybe they gain a voting right to choose the next trustee of the institution, and it becomes this dynamic digital autonomous democratic organization that just rolls forward in time. Its really wild when you imagine the possibilities. It points towards all the new institutional possibilities enabled by Bitcoin. Which in my opinion it calls into question the structure and the purpose of the firm today. So Bitcoin gives us this monetary layer capable of dematerializing these institutions weve needed in the past for sovereignty, to establish what Saylor called immortal sovereignty. And it does it in a way that empowers the trustees of these organizations to be self-sovereign, so that they can actually resist geopolitical sea changes and adapt to changes in political climates of the time. Whereas historically you wouldve needed to trust that institution itself, and should it be invaded in wartime or broken down due to a civil dispute within the country, then you wouldve lost the sovereignty that you wouldve vested trust in the state park or whatever the will you were trying to project beyond your life  its fate wouldve been vested with the survivability of the sovereignty of that institution. So Bitcoinby being a monetary base layer that maximizes the sovereignty of individuals and being optimized for survivability actually gives us a whole new way of establishing this immortal sovereignty across time! Another way to think about that is: Bitcoin is collapsing the cost of money, its collapsing transaction cost, its collapsing the costs of satisfying the functions of the central bank, and it also just collapses this cost of immortal sovereignty. Which again, the Rockefellers needed $100 Million in assets and a $5 Million annual operating budget to achieve to establish the Rockefeller Foundation. Now you can do that in theory at least with just a much smaller Bitcoin stash, some software, and some really long-term strategic thinking! So I like the analogy too that Saylor used: If you wanted to host your website reading materials for the course of 1,000 years, you could actually chop up the keys to that institution  the Bitcoin endowment for that institution  give it to 5 trustees, encode a set of rules such that people have to read your materials and pass a test to maybe gain a voting right so that they get to decide the [successor] to each trustee. And in that way the thing kind of becomes this decentralized autonomous organization over time that just preserves your will and testament which was to have this body of knowledge go into the future for the benefit of humanity. So I thought that was really cool and points to just the new possibilities that Bitcoin brings into the world! It not only causes us to question the purpose of the firm itself and other organizational models we use, but its also creating something thats truly timeless. And this is where Saylor called this, Creating monuments in cyberspace  I thought that was a really cool way to look at it, is that by gaining immortal sovereignty through Bitcoin-enabled institutions, we can actually create things that well-outlive us yet still are shaped and influenced by our living will and testment beyond our own life. Finally we got into a topic we touched on earlier which was that money is power. And we combined it with another topic that we touched on previously which was that sufficiently advanced technology is magic. So by combining these two concepts wed say that a sufficiently advanced monetary technology is magical power, effectively! And it lets its users cast spells or cast curses. On the spell side we went into this park in Naples that as Saylor described was surrounded by wealth but for whatever reason was not receiving an allocation of that wealth to preserve the park and keep it pristine. So again to establish that immortal sovereignty historically they had to go out and buy up this land and basically turn it into national parks because they were then vesting their will and testament with the longest-lived sovereign power of the time  which was the nation state  to maximize the chances of preserving their intention across time. The point there was that the 501c3 non-profit foundation laws  they were actually written by Rockefellers attourneys! So this shows the relationship between money and government. The common misconception is that the government is the originator of money, but what is in fact true is that money is the originator of government! That wealth itself tends to shape the laws around it that determine its management, preservation, and distribution over time. On the other side where we were talking about casting a curse  we didnt talk a lot about this but just thinking out loud, if you had an organization like Anonymous, which is this anonymous set of computer hackers distributed all over the world, you could in theory fund them in perpetuity with a Bitcoin-based smart contract enabled endowment that would effectively fund their hacking attempts or attempts to say dissolve the power structures of government or to remedy any government mistreatment of civilians  things like that. So it could be used in both a defensive way  say to defend the park in Naples  but it could also be used offensively to attack hostile organizations like national government. So thats just an incredible way to think about how many ways Bitcoin not only shapes and influences our willpower and intention by lowering our time preference and elevating our morality, but also gives us this medium through which to project it over much longer time and space horizons! So it really is one of those tools that is just radically shaping who we are. We touched on the religious aspects of Bitcoin, but even if you just strip that out and said its just an ideology, it is perhaps one of the most pure and principled ideologies theres ever been! If you respect Fairness, Equality, Natural Law, Thermodynamics, Mathematics, Freedom  thats what Bitcoin positively embodies essentially! And such a pure and pristine ideology is something people find worth fighting and even dying for. So it does have these qualities of a religion or of its own independent nation state if you will. Its just challenging all of our language even to describe what it is. Although we focus on its monetary properties exploring it as money by asking this question, What is Money?, I think we come to see Bitcoin as even much more than that. Or perhaps even saying money is much more than that! Money is foundational. Its like the base operating system to all these other higher order operating systems we have like the nation states and religious institutions, etc. As I said once before, people come to Bitcoin for the profits, I think almost everyones drawn in by Number Go Up, but I think the people that really come and stay and find roots in Bitcoin and purpose and meaning and devoting their lives to this space, they stay for the principles! Bitcoin  come for the profits, stay for the principles. So that was it, that was Episode 8 guys. I hope you enjoyed that one. This has just been a dynamite series so far.

They build a lot of foundation that we draw upon continually as we progress further into this series. So today were gonna discuss Bitcoin as a monetary missile, which if you remember from Episode 1, missiles are one of the quintessential Stone Age technologies so we draw analogies to that. We also talk about Bitcoin as the creature that never sleeps. Again to the great Kraken itself and why this makes it a superior form of money. Well also look at the effects of humans intervening into complex systems and what that does to complex systems and the consequences that it generates. And finally well look at some of the reasons why Bitcoin may actually be the sole sound store of value for the 21st Century, well compare it to alternatives and draw the reasons why it is superior across a number of dimensions. Then well get into the Talebian concept of via negativa and how it relates to Bitcoin and technology more generally. Finally we get into a really interesting aspect of Bitcoin not often discussed. And that is the  we look into the fanaticism of Bitcoin maximalists as an asset, as a value creator for this asset class itself. And that leads us naturally into discussion of Bitcoin as a religion. Were gonna go deep again today. Im really excited for this one. So lets dive in!", "image": null}

The metaphor  Kraken  its a pretty good metaphor because its always going and its never stopping. And remember back to our previous discussion, I was saying in Jurassic Park the guy picks a fight with the little dinosaur and then he realizes that theres a hundred of those little dinosaurs and they dont sleep. And when you pick a fight with a swarm and the swarm doesnt sleep and you sleep, you realize youre gonna lose! Youre doomed! Theres that point youre gonna realize youre doomed because you cant keep up with a software creature with a million heads that is continuously working everywhere all the time. And heres the thing you know: the thing thats working thats dominating the market in Bitcoin all the time  its the strongest version of the creature in that domain, not the weakest! The weak parts of the herd get culled out, theyre being deprived of their capital, theyre being squeezed out. You see it with the Mt. Gox disaster  anything that doesnt quite work. And so this asset class is a living asset class. And its strength comes from the fact that its being developed  its not constrained by the lowest common denominator, its strengthened by the highest common denominator! If theres somebody in the world, if theres an exchange in the world that can actually do this better, faster, stronger and it comes onto the Bitcoin network, they will set the price. Even if youre just HODLing, if youre just sitting there holding an asset  lets say Im HODLing $100 Million of Bitcoin and Im wishing it would go up in value. And then lets say theres a million kazillion laws in the United States that prevent people from trading index futures on Bitcoin. But somebody in Malta is able to do it, or somebody in Singapore is able to launch that exchange. So Singapore launches an exchange that matches billions of dollars of forward index buyers or option buyers to billions of dollars of call buyers, and that attracts tens of billions of dollars of capital in the market because it solves the yield curve problem. Lets say hypothetically somebody on a centralized or decentralized or Lightning Network exchange solves the yield curve problem. If I could give you 8% risk-free yield on 10-year money, presumably you can take $100 Billion and you can take that money and you can short fiat. Short the dollar, go long the Bitcoin, squeeze the 8% yield on $100 Billion, make yourself $8 Billion a year. If you can figure out how to do that in Singapore, you set up in Singapore, you do it in Singapore  what happens to the price of Bitcoin? Goes up! What happens to the HODLer sitting in Schenectady, New York  that never did anything, that didnt touch it, that doesnt know about it, that doesnt understand it  with their little 1 Bitcoin?", "image": null}

You throw off the balance! This goes all the way back to your original point that theres no fair fight in the world. And that when human intervention tries to make that fight more fair, the intervention into a complex system throws off all these unintended consequences. That is one of the things thats gotten us into the situation that were in today with low and negative interest rates. Weve constantly tried to introduce an economic analgesic to paper over the business cycle or paper over losses. And weve distorted the natural price discovery function of the market, and so now were in these totally asinine times with stock market at an all-time high and 40 Million people unemployed. And this is one of Talebs main theses is: Human beings have to strive to not intervene with Mother Nature. Mother Nature has been executing a certain strategy for a long time  we have to assume that its being done for a reason, no matter what Science tells us!", "image": null}

And if its the time-value of energy, interest rate is the value of time. And maybe if we come back to thermodynamics  the rule of thermodynamics is: time cannot go backwards. Entropy is at [work] time must move forward. Trying to drive interest rates to zero or negative is a war on time. Youre trying to make time go backwards! Youre trying to make water flow uphill. Youre trying to reverse gravity. Youre trying to reverse the laws of thermodynamics. Its me saying to you, Robert, will you give me everything that you own  give it to me  you go without, Im going to keep it, and when you die Im going to give a third of it back to your heirs! And so the only way you would do that is if you thought the future of your life had negative value! If you knew you were gonna be serial axe-murderer killer and you knew it in advance and you thought, You know, I should be deprived of the future of my life because Im really a liability to humanity. Maybe! But if you actually thought that the future had any value, you couldnt make that trade. No rational person would say, Im gonna give you everything I have in return for half of it back when Im dead. Its so moronic its just insane! And so when Im trying to drive the interest rate to zero or negative, Im actually trying to reverse time and make it run backwards. Im first trying to stop it, and then trying to make it run backwards. Im trying to reverse entropy. Im trying to put the genie back in the bottle.

It aligns itself with the thermodynamic arrow of time. It seems almost serendipitous that Bitcoin is released at this time when the system is starting to come apart in this decade.

So if someone is sensitive to a given issue  and Satoshi was sensitive to financial integrity, and obviously had some decent sensitivity and awareness of Austrian economics and the perils of inflation and the moral hazard of bank bailouts  so that was a sensitive individual that tapped into a bunch of other sensitive nodes  individuals  who shared that. And its almost like: I pricked you with a needle and I introduced this little pathogen and then you swelled up with some inflammation. And the inflammation grew and festered and some antibodies build and the organism builds and the organism got bigger, and it got bigger, and it got bigger. And then it got fed.

Were back to this issue of: Zoom was inevitable. YouTube was inevitable. Virtual business models were inevitable. Bitcoin was inevitable. But it sure did get accelerated by certain things that happened! Bitcoin had 10 years of I would say a 7% forcing function with the dollar, and it got goosed a bit harder with Argentina and other developing world countries and, you know, the anxieties of Syria and the anxieties of Iraq and the anxiety in Africa and the anxiety in South America and the like, so those stressors  that goosed it. And the currency wars pushed it a bit harder. And then I think the pandemic crisis lit it on fire! I could say Robert, like, theres no way Im talking to you if theres no pandemic! But I dont think for a second that Bitcoin wouldnt be successful without me, and I dont think anybodys gonna stop it, but I do think there is an avalanche of energy  individuals and corporations  that got inspired and driven into this ecosystem because of the pandemic. Again, back to war: Wars cause paradigm shifts. And this year theres a currency war, and thats a war on money as a store of value, right? And that war on money as a store of value creates massive dislocations in the bond market and the equity market, and there are consequences to everything. Ultimately, Bitcoin is an antifragile but scalable platform serving as a store of value.

Bitcoin is an incredible store of value. I think thats its primary use case, or its killer value proposition now and probably for the next decade  maybe forever! The entire world is looking for a store of value right now, and you have to look across $250 Trillion of assets. If we think that asset inflation is running north of 10%  and I think it is, I think its pretty clear it is  and if you have capital, you have to choose between bonds, $80 Trillion in sovereign debt or corporate debt or municipal debt, or mortgage-backed securities, or you gotta choose equities, tech equity, conventional equity, or you gotta go to precious metals, or you go to real property, real estate property. And when you look at all of those things, the problem is half of all real estate is impaired because of the political response to COVID, and its not likely thats gonna change in the next 10 years. Weve probably got 10 years of uncertainty about real estate assets, especially commercial real estate assets. The other challenge with real estate is the taxes on it. Its illiquid, immobile, and highly taxed. Generally real estate is taxed annually everywhere, its just a question of whether its 20 basis points or 200 basis points. So that makes real estate a challenging store of value. And that takes you to bonds: Bonds have worked as a store of value when the interest rates keep going lower. You can see that everybody thats been on the bond train and benefiting from it, theyre screaming as loud as they can: They want negative interest rates! Because theyre like  The secret to success is lower the interest rates 50 basis points a year or 100 basis points a year and its a no-lose proposition  for them. But at this point its getting kind of ridiculous silly because when interest rates go negative everybody takes their money out of the bank, it creates bank runs, all the bank systems break. Its kind of a morally bankrupt  I mean a lot of people, they dont really understand that theyre being abused at 2% instead of 5%. But pretty much everybody can figure out that when youre being billed 1% of the money you have at a bank, youre being abused!", "image": null}

It takes us to equity. Weve got an equity bubble thats a very crowded trade, but the real issue with equity as a store of value is that the revenue gets taxed as sales tax, the cash flows get taxed as income tax, the expenses  the cost structure gets taxed as employee and payroll tax. Then the trade gets taxed  theres a tariff. Then you have the existential threat or regulatory risk of onerous regulations. Pick up the paper and see maybe Australias gonna bill Google every time they link to a newspaper article, and then if Google doesnt link the newspaper articles theyre gonna get fined for not linking the newspaper articles! And as these things become more powerful, they become regulated utilities and politicians start to think that they can and should be regulated  and maybe with good cause! If theres only one provider of information anywhere in the country then it definitely becomes a political issue. So thats the challenge with equities: they might work for 2, 3, 4 years, but theyre valued as a multiple of cash flows. So if all of the liquidity of the civilization gets squeezed out of debt  when interest gets to zero  the government and the Fed owns all the debt. Okay, they bought me out  now I gotta put it in something else so I jump on equities so now equities double. But now the P/Es double or triple, and the revenue multiples triple. Whats the value of an equity? The value of equity should in theory be tangible assets on the balance sheet plus the sum of the discounted cash flows. And so people are using equities as store of value today. In fact you could make the argument that equities are the most popular store of value for the majority with their Robinhood trading  theyre all buying Apple, Amazon, Facebook, NASDAQ, SPDRs  everybody! Even though nobody thinks revenues are going up this year, nobody thinks earnings are going up this year, but equity values have doubled this year. Well that means that theyre getting riskier! So if you contrast Bitcoin to equity, the problem is: if the price of an equity goes up by a factor of 10, youve got more risk because its delaminating from its underlying cash flows and its fundamentals. Because it is a centralized, regulated entity, and the only way that the cash flows are going to grow into that value is they keep raising the price. And if theyre a monopoly and the raise the price, the regulators will react. If they dont raise the price, they cant grow into the multiple! And so you kind of have a chicken and the egg thing, right? And if theres any competition and their cash flows deteriorate, eventually youre trading at 200:1 or 200 P/E, and then any degree of disappointment causes massive volatility. And how are they different than Bitcoin? Well, Bitcoins value proposition is the liquidity, it is the store of value  that is it! If youre going to function as money, you want to be a single-celled organism  like the algae of the ecosystem. The base layer of the ecosystem thats plankton or bacteria or single cells. You dont want to be a vertebrate! And these companies are vertebrates with a brain and a backbone, and that means  for example, WeChat or TikTok has a headquarters  and if its in the wrong country, it gets its head chopped off. And Apple and Facebook, theyre subject to a certain court, a certain countrys jurisdiction. So that means theyre foreigners somewhere else! Theyre vertebrate. If youre a vertebrate, I can kill you with a needle. A human being I can figure out how to kill: theres a heart, I take a needle, I poke there  youre gone. Youre very fragile. Hard to do that with a swarm of hornets. Hard to do that with all the plankton in the ocean. Its very difficult to do it with an amorphous decentralized invertebrate of some sort. So if you want a store of value, you dont want a company thats valued based upon the ability to engineer hyper-complicated products that have to keep getting upgraded. You want something which is simple, that can just keep things simple. This is again where some of the crypto-enthusiasts, they keep wanting to tinker with a better blockchain, a better crypto. You know, they never saw an upgrade they didnt like so they just wanna keep revving it every year. Like its the iPhone version 37. Theres a fundamental difference, which is: if theres a bug in the iPhone version 37, everybody in the worlds heart doesnt stop!", "image": null}

I think this analogy youre using with the simplicity of plankton being the base layer for the ecosystem is apt. I want to say plankton makes up the majority of the biomass on the planet by a pretty substantial margin because its so simple and its so efficient at converting solar energy into biological energy. And then it is the base layer for this multiplicity of layered ecosystem that we have in the world. And another thing I think is interesting is that you make a great point that equities are becoming more risky as they increase in price, because theyre delaminating from their valuation fundamentals as you said. And Bitcoins the opposite. Actually the more valuable Bitcoin is, the more secure its network, the greater the liquidity, the more resistant it is to attack. So its a very interesting counter-trade to equities as a store of value.", "image": null}

So the moral of the story is that disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. And I think thats getting to your point here is that its getting stronger by taking away. Your factual base on which youre building your premise and strategy in the world is strengthened by disconfirmation moreso than it is by confirmation.", "image": null}

Thats a truly great piece of software: You ask the wrong question and it gives you the right answer because it knows which question you shouldve asked and it knows how you shouldve spelled it and said, Were gonna answer this question for you instead because the odds that you really wanted to know this question answered is 99,000,000:1! The odds that you really were asking a unique question that seems foolish and misspelling a popular name while youre asking itthats 1 in a billion! So if you really wanted to ask the wrong question the wrong way you try it twice, but 99.999% of the time they give you the right answer to the wrong question and they do it because they built this very fault-tolerant, common-sense, rational interface. So back to store of value, right? Bitcoin is an ideal store of value because its got the ability to convey your energy not across 10,000 miles but across 10,000 days. 30 years into the future. 100 years into the future. Most people when theyre investing in assets, theyre taking this very short term view of like the next month, the next year, the next two years, and I find that if youre looking at a 3-year time frame, everything gets very very noisy and complicated and theres all these debates. But if you really want to end the debates, go out to 100 years and just take $100 Million and go through the exercise of giving it to someone  your heirs heirs heir in 100 years. And then all of a sudden, all this noise drops away. Can I put it into real estate? No, itll be taxed out of existence in 100 years. Can I put it in gold? No, 98% of it will be gone if 100% of it isnt gone in 100 years because we mine it to death. Can I put it into fiat? No its gonna be inflated to death. Can I invest it in a company? No, name one company thats around today that was around 100 years ago that hasnt been diluted, recapitalized, etc. Can I put it in a stock index? Well, youre trusting a human being to rebalance the index over and over again. What stock index do you trust for the next 100 years? And by the way its got counterparty risk at the nation state level. The nation might not be there, and 90% didnt make it! So what are you left with? And the truth is, when you just do that thought experiment its pretty obvious: You would put it in a crypto network, in a decentralized proof of work network if the adherents  the maximalists  were fanatic zealots about protecting the integrity of the network against meddlers who would screw it up. If the network is supported by those with a religious conviction to the network such that you could imagine 100 years from now there will still be people protecting the network  the phrase is, Keepers of the flame. Every great religion, every great institution has keepers of the flame, and there must be passion. Do you believe in your religion? Do you believe strong enough that youll flee persecution to continue to practice it? The United States was built on the foundation of separation of church and state, and its a pretty important and interesting metaphor: People came here because they could practice their religion! Thats why they came here! And they came here because their religion was above their government. They would not sacrifice whatever it is they believed in. If you look at every institution that lasts more than 100 years  name them: Harvard University, Cambridge, Oxford, the Catholic Church, Islamic sects, the Jewish faith  theres not that many! Theres churches or religious sects and then theres some educational institutions  and I see the educational institutions being shaken at their core this year! I mean literally you couldve said for 500 years  Ivy Leagues, the elite universities  theyre stalwart institutions. They have lost a huge amount of credibility this year! When you send all of your students home and you close the campus and people are studying virtually, peoples affiliation to the bricks and mortar of the institution has been dramatically weakened unless they morph into a virtual institution. The virtual institutions by the way have dramatically strengthened, right? Your affiliation with YouTube and Facebook and Apple TV and Bitcoin and Square Cash has dramatically strengthened. If its virtual. And your affiliation with the bricks and mortar physical institution has been weakened. And those that will survive have dematerialized and virtualized and theyve learned how to project their ethos in cyberspace. So yeah, back to the store of value: You need people  human beings, flesh and blood people  that are going to keep the flame. And the flame of Bitcoin is the node and the mining rig. Were getting into Bitcoin as religion or as faith now, but imagine 1,000 years ago, I want to keep a religion alive  I have an altar in my home. Every wealthy person had a chapel in their home. If you look at religions, go to the Far East, there are altars in Buddhist, Shinto, other faiths. So the idea of an altar or a shrine or a cathedral or a church  these are structures where people go to worship, and the worshiping is the feeding of the flame. And oftentimes during the worshiping theyre tithing and theyre channeling 10% of their money as energy into these religions in order to keep them relevant! If you look at fantasy fiction, in fantasy where they have gods, the strength of the god is a function of the devoutness of the worshipers, of the followers. Such and such was worshiped as the god of the forest, and they are worshiped as the god of the forest and all of their adherents  all their acolytes  are feeding energy to the god of the forest. And when theyre no longer worshiped, their energy goes away! If you lose your faithful, if they wont feed you with the fire of truth, with the energy that you need, your efficacy falls and you die. And so how do you feed a fire, right? If its a physical fire you have to throw wood on the fire. How do you feed a religion? You have to tithe  the Catholic Church, or any church  you have to give it money, and maybe you have to give it your life service. Onward Christian soldiers! I will fight for the cause. I will donate to the cause. Thats how you feed a religious institution. How do you feed a crypto network? You gotta spin up facilities of encrypted energy that adhere to the protocol. Every time a miner comes onboard its feeding the fire. Every time a node comes onboard its gonna certify and validate. Its protecting. Its creating one more chain in the fault-tolerance structure. And thats why a smaller crypto  a crypto thats a technical experiment, thats an application  isnt the good store of value. Because if the people are willing to fork it, if theyre willing to fork it and abandon it in order to [move to 48:44] a new technology, then the flame dies. And so its pretty clear that Bitcoin maximalists, they have a lot of the faith and the conviction of true believers in any religious faith for the past 2,000 years. And why wouldnt they? Because they share the same values. Their values are: Truth, Nature, Natural Laws, Laws of Physics, Laws of Thermodynamics, Math, Austrian Economics, No such thing as a free lunch, Self-Reliance, Honesty, Fairness, Technology Advances. They share those values. Theyre taking their monetary energy and tokenizing it on a Bitcoin network with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is that single shared store of value. If money is energy and energy begets life and a crypto decentralized network gives you sovereignty, thats a path to immortality, and that means that everybody in the Bitcoin community that believes in this for the long term is engaged in the pursuit of immortal life. And pursuit of immortal life sounds like a religious mantra, I think! And I grew up in the Southern Baptist faith so Im very familiar with the ideology of Christianity and pursuit of immortal life is pretty paramount there.", "image": null}

So its not just a metaphor I think to call Bitcoin religious, it quite actually is religious!", "image": null}

So the solution there is: You move from 3 years to 10 years, and then you move from 10 years to 100 years. And at the 100-year time frame its pretty clear whats an asset and whats a store of value! And its just very obvious: (A) Bitcoin is a store of value if its believers have religious conviction in it. It becomes very simple. Now, if you step out to a 1,000-year time frame and you say, Whats this thing gotta be in order to last 1,000 years? It better be the worship of Math and the Laws of Thermodynamics and the Laws of Physics and Einstein and Newton! That might make it! And if we just focus upon that and dont let all this other stuff get mired  I mean, thats reasonable! People have been studying and honoring Math and Algebra for 2,000 years, theyve been honoring Calculus for 400 years. You could say this is truly the adoption of economics as a science. Its that critical inflection point where economics went from being a political preference to being a science, and if you adopt it as a science then you actually get massive advantages technically.

That was Episode 7 with Michael Saylor here on the Saylor Series. And wow what an episode! We have gone really deep into the topic of Bitcoin and I think we had a really strong finish today. So Im just gonna run through a few of the things we talked about. We started out with this concept of Bitcoin as a monetary missile, and this took me back to Episode 1 when we were talking about fire, missiles, and hydraulics being these primary Stone Age technologies that allowed mankind to come into dominance in the world. And I thought the analogy was very interesting that, using Bitcoin we have this ultimate high ground behind a wall of encrypted energy, but we can also accelerate our monetary energy and deploy it anywhere in the world across any domain nearly instantly with virtually no frictions at all. And so not only does it give us this advantage of asymmetric terrain, but we also get maximal force with how we deploy that monetary energy in the generation of capital. So I thought that was a super-apt analogy. And then we talked about how that effectively makes Bitcoin the highest bandwidth price discovery, transparency, and security asset in the world. So we have this pure money that propagates pure price signals so it would allow for pure price discovery  all of that is premised on the open source ethos, which is essentially just absolute transparency  and that gives it the ultimate security. So theres a bit of a paradox there, its that: By being totally open to inspection, Bitcoin actually resists manipulation or emulation even, in that everything about it is out in the open. So its more a quality of its network effects, its liquidity, its first-mover advantage, even actually the disappearance of Satoshi which well get into a little bit later  all of these things sort of wrap this open technology in an apparently disruption-proof casing. So I thought that was a really powerful discussion point. And Saylor calls Bitcoin, The creature that never sleeps. We have this swarm intelligence, if you will, that never stops growing, changing, adapting, trading  it is just a fully autonomous and perpetual monetary network competing against these other monetary networks that are rigidly controlled in certain time windows. And to his point, an individual organism has to sleep, but a swarm creature does not! So the swarm creature necessarily out-competes the individual organism because it doesnt need to sleep. It just keeps adapting, growing, becoming more fit. And as we know from Darwin, its the most fit competitor that wins out in an ecosystem. And I thought this was a great point too and I never thought of it this way, that: In a swarm, the weakest elements are actually weeded out. So its constantly sacrificing its weaker elements to natural selection and thereby strengthening the ensemble. Whereas the individual organism is subject to any singular attack vector. If its defense is penetrated, the whole entity or organism is lost. [1:02:17] So in that way centralized entities are only as strong as their weakest link, or as Saylor says, Are constrained by their lowest common denominator. Whereas a decentralized entity like the swarm is gonna be strengthened by its highest common denominator. So we can think about this as kind of like something that learns at the edges. So if one member of the swarm figures out how to effectively deal with a predator or a threat, then it will tend to reproduce and its genes will be replicated into the rest of the swarm. So the entire decentralized entity or organism is actually learning at the edges and incorporating those lessons into its whole body. Whereas the centralized entity, if it encounters a predator it doesnt know how to deal with or even figures out how to defeat, it doesnt spread that adaptivity to the rest of its body, essentially. Its just a one-to-one relationship versus the one-to-many. So the one-to-many gives it just much more intelligence and adaptivity in the long run. And tying this back to Bitcoin, its as if  to Saylors point  any market participant in the Bitcoin network figures out a way to deliver a solution smarter, faster, stronger, better, thats where the capital will flow! Because again, the capital is unrestricted. It is not siloed to any particular jurisdiction or institution  individuals have maximal sovereignty over their Bitcoin capital so they can move it anywhere in the world. So in his example of: Say someone is setting up a centralized or decentralized institution in Singapore for instance that solves the yield curve problem  so matching lenders and borrowers of Bitcoin in a way that establishes a long term yield curve for Bitcoin  that this would create all of a sudden this risk-free rate on Bitcoin which is the one thing that it lacks, as we discussed in earlier episodes, to make it a truly pristine collateral that would be competitive to say US Treasuries. So Bitcoin currently just doesnt have a yield. But if you could match borrowers and lenders you could actually create that curve. So his point was, Say we create this 8% risk-free rate on Bitcoin on 10-year money which could be usedand you have fiat deprecating at say 2% a year best-case  then all of a sudden this opens up an attack vector on fiat where you could actually go long Bitcoin and short the Dollar and squeeze the difference in yield. This is called a speculative attack. And this would have the effect of strengthening the speculative attacker himself, but it would also strengthen the HODLer in Schenectady or in whatever town that doesnt know anything about this, just by virtue of more price appreciation pressure being applied to Bitcoin. So more energy being drawn into the network actually benefits all network participants! And this is contrary to a centralized entity. And if you flip this back to the Great Wall of China example, its like youve inverted that security model. So whereas the Great Wall of China  its just a perimeter defense, it doesnt adapt, and if you can penetrate at any point of it the whole defensible area is lost, thats actually what happened when the Mongols penetrated the gatewhereas Bitcoin is effectively this swarm intelligence. So any network participant that can figure something out is benefiting the entire network, and then youve also further capitalized or further energized those network participants to go out and solve other problems on behalf of other network participants. So theres this virtuous cycle built right into it that just does not exist with any other form of money. [1:06:33] Then we take a bit of a pivot and we got into how human intervention negatively and adversely impacts complex systems. And Saylor gave the example of the lions complaining that the antelopes are too fast so the hunter hobbles the antelope. The lions kill all of the antelope, get lazy because they arent being pushed to their limits, so then after all the antelope are eliminated, the lions starve to death and then the hunter blames it on the weather! This is a core concept in Talebs books where he says that human intervention moves us from what he calls Mediocristan to Extremistan. Meaning essentially that the non-linearity of effects goes through the roof once we try to intervene in natural systems, because there are all these dynamic equilibria that were unaware of. And when we offset, when we try and press one lever to cause one result, theres a cascade of unintended consequences surrounding that. One common example here is called the Cobra problem. And you can look this up on, say, Wikipedia, but the gist of it is that  I forget what country  but they had a problem with an overpopulation of cobras, so they passed a law that offered a ransom for every dead cobra brought to the government  theyd give you $10  whatever it was. And this had the unintended consequence of incentivizing people to actually start breeding cobras and killing them and then to take them into the government and get this reward! So it actually further exacerbated the overpopulation problem and financially compromised the local government. So thats just one example where good intentions go awry, and history is just full of these! So tying that back into money: I guess you could say the central bank or interest rate manipulation  intentionality aside  we could possibly argue that it was done with the attempt to make things better. You can argue both sides of that. Lets just say for instance that it was done with good and wholesome intentions to benefit the economy or stimulate demand or keep prices stable and unemployment low and predictable and all these things. That still  when youre talking about suppressing interest rates to induce money creation and borrowing  youre going to war with the temporal and energetic principles of thermodynamics, because again the price of moneythe interest rate  is the price of time! Im gonna give you money now that youre gonna give me back later. Theres a price associated with that which youre paying meits called the interest rate. If a centralized body is artificially suppressing that, youre actually trying to  and what Saylor said  was to reverse the flow of time. Youre discounting the price of time! And this has just so many disastrous unintended consequences around it! Which we went into. Youre pushing back against thermodynamics, which is the inviolable rule set of the universe. And I would argue that, actually, trying to suppress the price of time causes us to discount the value of our own time and the time of others. You could say time or energy, actually. And I think that is kind of the culprit at the heart of this moral hazard related to fiat currencies, is that were discounting time and energy, which is the intrinsic value of human beings, effectively. And thats the one case by the way where I use the term intrinsic value, because I do think humans are the only intrinsically valued  you could probably expand that to life more generally  but theres no objects that have intrinsic value, value is subjective, but life itself as living beings, that seems to be an absolute is that we should have value for life! Anyways, bit of a philosophical aside. And in that way this organism aspect  actually discounting the value of life  we see all the moral hazard that central banking has created, all the warfare its funded, its as if Bitcoin is an autoimmune response, somehow, from society to central banking. As Saylor said, clearly the message in the Genesis Block solidifies that. And he goes a little bit deeper actually to say that Satoshi was clearly an individual sensitive to these negative socioeconomic consequences of central banking, and his own sensitivity was a response to the sensitivity of others: People who had been marginalized or victimized by the system throughout the ages. You could call that a form of inflammation, basically, in the socioeconomic super-organism. And then Satoshi was just the cell of the organism that figured it out! He figured out the correct response, launched it into the world in the right way at the right time. So I thought that was just really interesting. And Brandon Quittem  I talked to him about the Fourth Turning. He made the point  and I havent actually read this book yet  but he made the point that in these long cycles, theres First, Second, Third, Fourth Turnings, there tends to come a kind of pivotal moment or innovation or something that comes just at the right time to reverse course. And it feels and seems like Bitcoin is definitely becoming that in the modern age! The world is just going in one direction on central banking and we needed some autoimmune response and it appears Bitcoin is that! Then we got into Bitcoin as a store of value. I think he made very strong arguments  especially when you zoom out to a 100+ year time frame  that Bitcoin is basically the sole 21st Century store of value. It just is incomparable to anything else. And this 2020 war on currency and escalating government overreach, this has just pushed an awareness of Bitcoin on people and sort of accelerated that autoimmune response in a way. And to just compare it real quick, because we went through alternative stores of value, you have bonds, but theyre not bumping up against the zero-bound, and to Saylors point, its harder to discern when youre being taken advantage of when the natural interest rate is 5% and youre getting 2%, but its much easier for market participants to understand that theyre getting screwed when theres a negative yield. Theres something very special about crossing that zero barrier and thats where bonds are at today. And they are getting quickly decimated as a viable store of value because theres no yield. Equities, theyre way overvalued across all fundamentals and valuation metrics  historic all-time highs, P/E ratios, multiples on EBITDA or enterprise value, etc. And that iswhat I would argue as a Bitcoiner  is a function of: weve compromised the store of value function of fiat currency, so that function is now  the markets figuring out it needs to assign that function to any other asset! And equities are somewhat reliably scarce at least. But this has a perverse effect in thatas Saylor says  the price of equities are delaminating from their fundamentals. So theyre overvalued in the marketplace. And theyre actually becoming more and more risky. Theres this perverse effect of: the more we use an equity as a store of value, the less effective it is as a store of value in the long run, which is really strange. And Bitcoin is the opposite of that! Bitcoin is actually becoming more secure as a store of value as its price increases, and therefore more attractive. And this is an economic concept called a Veblen good, which you could look up, but basically there are certain assets that the demand tends to increase as the price increases, which is contrary to most other assets. But I think Bitcoin fits that category. Commodities are another alternative  we destroyed those in earlier episodes as Saylor checked those out. And finally real estate, which has been a really popular one for the past 50 years especially in the US  real estate cannot be hidden and its being taxed every year. Its the easiest thing in the world to tax because you cant hide it, and that is the dominion on which the government projects its power. So I think theres really high valuations there, plus theres no concealability so that sort of compromises real estate as a good store of value. He makes the point that, to be a good store of value, you really want to have a technology thats focused on that function. Equities, youre creating all kinds of other value in the economy, granted albeit riskily  theyre taking on risk and trying new ventures and figuring things out and innovating. Property would be probably be a little more stable but it still has other uses  theres actually a utility use there. So the point being: You want the pure store of value. Thats what gold effectively was  it was the purest store of value we had historically. [1:17:03] And now thats what Bitcoin is today. And we could say its kind of like being a single-celled organism. As Saylor said, You dont want to be a vertebrate with all these complex features, because the additional features open you up to more risk and attack surface. What you want is something very unidimensional, single-cell, just holds value in a trust-minimized way across time and space. And thats what Bitcoin is! That is the big breakthrough! And that led us into via negativa, which is another Talebian concept that I really like. And in a way this ties back to a quote that Saylor Tweeted once. He said, A designer knows he has achieved perfection when there is nothing left to take away. And as we discussed previously, money has 5 properties: divisibility, durability, recognizability, portability, scarcity. So what did Satoshi do in the creation of Bitcoin? The reason its so genius, and the reason Satoshis an artist, and the reason Bitcoin is effectively a perfected money is because Satoshi took away all of the indivisibility, all of the decomposability, all of the unrecognizability, all of the immovability, and all of the unpredictability from money! Right? He maximally removed all of these negative aspects of money to deliver us the quasi-perfection that is Bitcoin. And that speaks again to this minimization of attack surface. Youve reduced all of the features of money to strip it down to its bare bones. Just its bare monetary properties. And youve taken away all the negative aspects from those properties, so youve effectively perfected those properties. And this speaks again to Bitcoins resistance to disruption! Weve achieved attack surface minimization via monetary property optimization. So this is via negativa! The more you take away, what you have left becomes more valuable, essentially. And another way to say that is: We commonly hear that, Oh, this new crypto-asset can do this or that that Bitcoin cant do! But the lesser feature set of Bitcoin is a feature itself, not a bug! Because its whole value prop is survivability. It cannot be stopped. It is just perfected store of value that adheres to 21 Million and no one can shut down the network. No political or military action can shut down the network. That is the core value prop of Bitcoin. That is what it optimizes for. [1:20:05] And as Saylor puts this  again in one of his Tweets  he says, Bitcoin has no country, has no company, has no competitor. So thats what makes it so special, is that its something that actually exists beyond us, which turns out to be really important! And I would add to that too that Bitcoin has no identified creator. We know its Satoshi but no one knows who Satoshi is. We dont have his person to point toward. And the absence of that personality  the creator I would say actually gives Bitcoin mythological bedrock, which really underpins its decentralization. If we knew who Satoshi was and he was in the news every day, he was out getting drunk at the bar or something and everyone knew he had a million coins, it would just open him up to a lot of attacks and call a lot of things into question that his disappearance basically nullified. So this godhead of Bitcoin we call Satoshi I think really reinforces the value proposition of survivability and decentralization. And that gets us into what I thought was the most interesting part of the discussion today! And that was when Saylor pointed to the fanaticism of Bitcoin maximalists as an asset, as a contributing factor to the value of the Bitcoin network. And I love the analogy where the defenders of 21 Million effectively  the network participants themselves  we are the keepers of the flame. We are the mythological keepers of the flame. The point being there: to preserve an institution adequately over time, you need adherents or fanatics if you will that are so convicted in their belief that theyre willing to flee persecution to preserve the institution. And he drew the analogy to people coming to the US. People came to the US largely to practice religious freedom. People wanted a refuge that they could freely put their spiritual preferences above politics, and the US provided that. Then to bring it forward a bit, were seeing the faith shaken in existing institutions worldwide, whether its your government, your bankall these legacy institutions faith has been severely shaken, especially in the wake of COVID. Saylor made a great point: even at the universities where no ones going to campus anymore and theyre taking their classes online, youre reducing the affiliation with a brick and mortar university, and youre strengthening the affiliation with the digital university. So the institutions and companies and brands that adapt to the digital age more quickly will actually benefit more at the expense of legacy institutions. So thats a mega-political trend thats under way. And the flame for Bitcoin, if you will, is kept between the nodes, the miners, and the HODLers, which are basically preserving this dynamic equilibrium centered on 21 Million. And I love this analogy of worshiping at the altar, where people in the past all worshiped at the altar, they would actually feed the flame even by tithing say 10% of their income. So theyre funding this religious institution  theyre also preaching these values to their contemporaries or their kids, so theyre passing these values forward in time using both money and language, which I thought was very interesting. And ritual  I would add to that! So in the Bitcoin world weve gotten miners energizing the fire. Theyre adding additional energy to the network that is its security budget, effectively. You have nodes protecting the fire, which are basically selecting the rule set that the miners are enforcing. And then we have the HODLers themselves which are the fire! Theyre the living flame thats centered around 21 Million, so its like this group of people, this social layer, thats all oriented to preserving 21 Million which benefits everyone and intertwines everyones fate. And each one of those is just another element in this composite fault-tolerant structure that we call Bitcoin. So its this radically new way to think about it as more of a religious-like institution. And maybe you could even say that nodes, miners, and HODLers are kind of like the Holy Trinity of Bitcoin. Maybe 21 Million is the God or something that theyre oriented around. Might be a stretch, but I thought Id mention that nonetheless. So Bitcoin as religion  the question comes naturally: What are its values? And Saylor declares: Truth, Natural Law, Thermodynamics, Self-Reliance, Honesty, Fairness, Technology, Self-Sovereignty  all of these things are embedded in the value system of true Bitcoiners, and they carry that into the world in their word, in their deed, in their investments. And I just cant think of a more robust, powerful, effective, well-organized group of people in the world than the Bitcoiners Ive interacted with! Ive said it before: Theres nothing in the world that makes me more bullish on Bitcoin than Bitcoiners. And again, if we go back to the purpose of Man or at least what distinguishes him and what makes him superior to the other animals, its our ability to channel energy across space and time. And I love Saylors point: Energy begets life. So Bitcoin is being this tool for immortalizing the channeling of energy. We can channel it across space and time in any direction we want with essentially no loss. That 21 Million  or Bitcoin itself  its actually in a way kind of the pursuit of immortal life. Were pursuing a medium that maximally preserves energy across space and time. So its like, Pfft, well of course its a religious institutionwere pursuing immortal life! Not immortal life in the sense that you live forever, but a network or institution that lives forever for the betterment of all, and one in which you can project your own wills and values beyond your own life. The example there was the Saylor Foundation, which is: his value  Saylors own personal value system  is free education for all. He thinks that is something thats really important for the human race, and now with Bitcoin he has a way to finance and project those values beyond his own life. He can now do something to fund and strengthen this institution beyond his own life in a way that was not possible before Bitcoin, and you could say that this is a way of him projecting values and willpower and intentions and preferences into his own afterlife, if you will. It doesnt mean Heaven, but just beyond his own life. And then we touched on another religious aspect of this: its that 21 Million is truly transcendent. It is something no one can do anything about. And I think that speaks to its religious qualities in a way as well. He had this great quote, it said: If you worship Science, the Laws of Physics, Thermodynamics, and Mathematical Clarity, then Bitcoin is your religion! I thought that was beautifully said. It points back to us. The strength of Bitcoin as a store of value, as money, is rooted in the faithfulness of its adherents, of its believers, if you will. So it is up to all of us to preserve the principles embodied in those fields of study. And thats what Bitcoin is. We concluded with: Perhaps economics through all of history was just more of a political preference or much more just a social science. Even in Austrian Economics, theres a very low use of objective measurements because there are no constants in human action, effectively. But it seems like with Bitcoin we do have this collision of computer science and everything underpinning that with the softer social science of economics. So maybe this is the emergence of something really different and unique, like a more objective economic science. These things like Value, Supply & Demand  supply is the objective side, demand is the subjective side  these things are still gonna hold the same qualities, but the introduction of absolute scarcity and a money that cannot be monopolized and resists corruption certainly changes the game, right? I dont know that it will cause us to rewrite the history books per se, but we will move more towards this engineering-like mindset in the field of economics. So yeah! That was it, man! A monster episode. I hope you guys enjoyed that. Episodes 1, 2, 3 built a lot of foundation. I think 4, 5, 6 really started to build some crescendo here, and 7 was a big peak for me personally, especially the later stages of this discussion. I definitely think were routing around the bottom of the Bitcoin rabbit hole! I hope you guys enjoyed this and Ill see you back here soon for the next one!", "image": null}

Welcome back to Episode 6 of the Saylor Series here on the What is Money? Show! So today were gonna be talking about how Bitcoin is harder, smarter, faster, and stronger than any form of money in existence! Specifically well be drawing a lot of analogies to gold, which Bitcoinas weve discussedis disrupting too! And were gonna look at this through a number of angles. And a lot of this is building on things we touched on early on in the series like specifically getting into Stone Age technologies and actually how the use of tools and the harnessing of energy is what lets man be harder, faster, stronger, smarter than any other animal on the planet. So in fact these characteristics define the utility of both innovation and evolution! So the tool that best exhibits them tends to outcompete in the marketplace. So were drawing back to some lessons we made earlier. This is Episode 6 and if you havent checked out Episodes 15 yet I suggest that you do, because it all culminates into what were getting into now. Were gonna look at this through a number of angles. One is custody  how Bitcoin custody is very unique! Were also gonna get into the specter of quantum computing  there are a lot of people out there that like to think quantum computing is some kind of big threat to Bitcoin so well dismantle that one. Were also gonna get into the hardware and software updates of a technology like Bitcoin versus gold and fiat. Were also gonna look at the programmable aspects of Bitcoin and how that makes it unique! Were also gonna look at the defensibility of Bitcoin and how its one of the most defensible assets  if not the most defensible assets  in the history of mankind! And then were also gonna look at how  as monetary energy, Saylor likes to call it  Bitcoin lets us place capital more quickly and more intelligently than any other money before in terms of generating yield. So well get into some discussion on that as well. And then finally well get into Bitcoin as being the first truly digital native money  it is pure information! Its massless, it can be moved at the speed of light! And this enables a plethora of high frequency and micro transactions that were simply not possible with any other monetary technology historically! Finally well look at how all these elements are combined to give Bitcoin users and HODLers more optionality than any other money in history. And at the end of the day thats what money is  its the instrument for freedom. So with that, Im exciting to dive into this one! Were digging deeper into Bitcoin theory. And yeah  with that, lets get into it!", "image": null}

So Bitcoin is digital gold. And if we use that metaphor some people look at it in a very constrained sense and some people look at it more broadly, but when I say Bitcoin is digital gold, its harder, smarter, stronger, and faster than traditional gold! Theres a lot of depth behind it, and I dont know that its fully appreciated. Lets just start with harder: We talked a bit about how Bitcoin is harder because of its 21 Million cap, and its stock to flow is exponentially going to infinity. And thats the easy part of harder because youre exactly comparing it to gold! And if gold has a stock to flow of 50 and Bitcoin has a stock to flow of infinity then its harder! But, theres another element of harder that we dont talk about much, and its really Nicholas Talebs Antifragile harder! Bitcoin is an antifragile element. Ive used the metaphor cyber hornets but I think people think its a cute metaphor but Im not really thinking its a cute metaphor! What Im meaning is, its literally a swarm of cyber hornets that keep getting more powerful that you cant kill that are going to get harder and stronger and faster and theyre going to eat you if you try to stop them  and thats really hard! People dont think about it like that! But Ill give you an example, or another metaphor from history: The Great Wall of China. So the Great Wall of China was a defense, and its a material defense  its like a bunch of stones stacked up and its very expensive to create it, and it was meant to keep the Mongols out! And its a fragile defense, because its literally a static stone structure and it didnt keep the Mongols out. Eventually they found a weak point in one of the gates, cracked through, and then they slaughtered all the Chinese, defeated the empire  took over! Now how is that similar to what Alexander the Greats father said  Philip II of Macedon  hes attributed this quote: No citadel is impenetrable as long as it has a road wide enough for me to fit a donkey up it with a pot of gold on its back!", "image": null}

The third example we have in modern history is the Maginot Line, where the French built this impenetrable defense against the Germans and the Germans simply went around it through Belgium  by cheating! They hacked it! They just ducked it! And if you think about the lessons of military history, one of the lessons is: The best defense is a good offense. And another way to look at it is that if you want a good defense, you need an active defense  a moving defense! Youre a boxer in a ring and someone wants to hit you  your best defense is that you move quicker than them and you hit faster and harder than them while theyre getting ready to hit you  and so they cant!", "image": null}

Continuous adaptation, absorption of your enemys capabilities and reaction and you play them back at them! And so when we think about gold  Ive affectionately deemed gold the dumb rock  its a rock! Its not intelligent! Its not a life force! A coral reef is a life form! All forms of life  theyre living! Theyre adaptive! If you kill the weak element, the ones you didnt kill get stronger! With regard to Bitcoin, its composed of a number of elements: theres software  the software is running on hardware. The hardware is running in facilities that are plugged into the firmament of some domain. There are people that are running that software, that are operating those facilities, that are building that hardware. And those people are also acting in the political domain and the economic domain, right? There are people in the Bitcoin ecosystem that are improving the Square wallet, theyre improving the Binance exchange. So theyre improving the back end server exchanges, theyre improving the front end client software, theyre improving the hardware wallets, theyre improving the Bitcoin Core software, theyre improving the ASICs that the miners are running, there are people negotiating with governments everywhere on Earth to get better electricity, there are people that are negotiating with politicians to get better regulatory treatment, there are people that are marketing Bitcoin and there are educators  yourself, on YouTube! There are people on Twitter, there are communicators, there are analysts that are creating analytical functions that are being used to drive and channel the network. Theyre all moving! Theyre all evolving! They are strong exchanges getting stronger! There are weak exchanges getting weaker, right? We see that all around us! There are countries where Bitcoin mining is flourishing, there are countries where Bitcoin mining is under attack. Gold is a dumb rock  it is sitting on the floor. Gold is not going to move itself! Gold is not going to feel pain! Its not gonna feel pity, its not gonna feel inspiration  its just going to lie there and wait. And Bitcoin is a different thing! So the antifragility of Bitcoin comes from the fact that everybody in the ecosystem feels the same pain in the same way. If Bitcoins price goes down, every Bitcoin HODLer feels it! If Bitcoin is hacked and goes to zero, every Bitcoiner loses their lifes energy! We are a hive creature all integrated with one anotherand when there is that pain it spreads very quickly through the entire ecosystem! The information flows rapidly! So if we consider threats to Bitcoin  a lot of people, they always whine  I hear this whine, Well what about the quantum computer? What about the quantum computer? And I wanna say, Yeah! And what if an asteroid hits the Earth and kills us all? Or, what about a pocket thermonuclear pencil that blows up the entire universe and what if your enemy gets it before you did? I mean theres a lot of silly notions of that  What if somebody had the impossibly powerful weapon and theyre evil and they decide to use it on you? You could look at it that way, but I think a more constructive way to look at it is: If someone comes up with a computer that runs twice as fast as the current computers! The most profitable use of the computer is Bitcoin mining! If someone comes up with something which mines, that generates SHA-256 crypto hashes faster than the current generation of Bitcoin mining equipment, the most lucrative thing you can do with it is plug it into the network and start to contribute more hash rate! And so, who do you think is gonna notice first when that thing happens? If someone comes up with a better  Well what happens when it gets so powerful that it can break SHA-256? Well, dudes, were just gonna go to SHA-512! Or were gonna go to the next thing  1024! And anybody that ever studied computer science knows: We start with 16, go to 32, go to 64, go to 128, 256, 512, 1024, and so on and so forth  and the numbers get pretty fricking big! And then when they get done with that they flip to the next protocol, the next protocol! [16:16] Who do you think is gonna figure that out? The people that have $500 Billion of risk to figure it out? Or someone thats got no money at all but thinks they might just want to solve the problem just so they can crack the world? And its like, Yeah, maybe! But its just as likely that some dudes gonna come up with a revolver that shoots like photon bullets and theyre going to crash the United States government because theyre the first dude with a photon bullet revolver. Its an interesting idea  Im a lot more persuaded if the Pentagon with their hundreds of billions of dollars is gonna come up with a photon bullet gun or the laser rifle or the whatever. So the entire network is channeling innovation. You come up with better hardware? Its gonna go into the miners. You come up with better client software? Its gonna go into the wallets. You come up with a better software, or a way to write software? Dont you think people in the Bitcoin Core community are gonna use that way to write better software? And if its too dangerous, the community is gonna slow it down  otherwise, if theres a political threat, everybody thats adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset has a vested interest in dealing with the political threat. And if they cant deal with it  if you are a creature with two arms and I wrap a tourniquet around one of your arms and I choke off the blood flow, the arm dies  use the other arm! When youre an octopus, youve got eight. When youre a hydra, youve got a million. So the entire creatures just going to move to a place where there is oxygen where it can live. And if it can fight, it will fight. And if it cant fight, it will morph itself into a different domain, and unless you figure out a way to kill it everywhere at the same time  utterly, down to the last node  youre probably not gonna kill it. And it seems to me that nobodys really got a vested interest in doing that and if they did its just not clear. Pick one government  one government attacks it, it becomes more useful to every other government. And they all cant agree on anything, ever. And even if they could agree on anything, ever, they still cant do it, right?", "image": null}

I love the quote from Philip II of Macedon about the road being wide enough for a donkey with a pot of gold.

And I think that is one of the key aspects of Bitcoin is that, even if you have this breakthrough  quantum computer, whatever it is  youre still incentivized to contribute that innovation to the network. That is the most lucrative, most energy-efficient strategy possible, even in that breakthrough environment. And to your point about cryptography  its always been a cat and mouse game. Its always been kind of the defense, someone trying to crack it, and then the defense adapts. To your point its a dynamic defense, and thats why its ongoing. Thats why its so relevant. And when you look at it through that lens, the most brilliant aspect of Bitcoin is that incentive schema, frankly  youre always incentivized to contribute to its longevity. Which seems to make it antifragile, to your point.", "image": null}

So gatekeeper is a very powerful metaphor: The reason that the Great Wall of China fell was because there were gates and there were gatekeepers. And the prosperity of 100 Million people could be destroyed by corrupting the one on the gate. As soon as the one gatekeeper opens the gate, the 100,000 person army comes through. And herein you see the problem with hiding behind a wall, or hiding behind a wall with a gate in it. A much better idea would be: I have my own 100,000 person army and when that army comes I stand against them. And thats what the Romans knew. The Romans never sat and cowered behind a gate, they knew  and anybody in a war knows  you have to go and leave the citadel and you have to actively fight the army that would kill you, because if they manage to surround you and isolate you, no amount of defense is going to hold [them] back. They will find a way through, and thats the story of history. Gatekeepers are your weakness! Theres no gatekeepers in Bitcoin, and theres no gatekeepers in a decentralized proof of work network thats energy-intensive. Thats one of the problems I think of like proof of stake networks or the  every time someone tries to come up with a more efficient way to do it, well if youre going to secure a $1 Trillion network with $1 Billion of stuff staked, the problem with that is all I need is another $1 Billion to bribe that person. Or half a billion! Half a billion bribes half that network and then I topple the entire trillion and I get it all, right? So when you have anything where Im playing games where Im trying to use a small amount of energy  and money is energy, right?  a small amount of money, a small amount of energy. If youre trying to use a small amount of energy to secure a large amount of energy, you created a gatekeeper! And so you need to flip the pyramid, and thats why theres no shortcuts here: Theres no such thing as a free lunch. And it doesnt terribly bother me that Bitcoin channels a lot of energy. By the way  through encryption facilities! A miner is an encryption facility, its generating SHA-256 hashes and youre gonna have to get through that hash wall, and the only way youre gonna get through it is youre gonna have to buy yourself 51% of all of that equipment on Earth, and then youre gonna have to harness 51% of all the energy, and then youre gonna have to attack and it still may not work!", "image": null}

When the things worth $10 Trillion and the transaction fees are 1%, theres gonna be $100 Billion worth a year worth of transaction fees, so its $51 Billion a year. If you cap that at 20x, its $1 Trillion just to go along with the program! So someones gonna have to have $100 Trillion and be really mad in order to want to spend $1 Trillion to destroy other people  it just doesnt make any sense. Plus, youre not gonna get to attack the thing without a counterattack, right? Because at the point that you have 100 Million people that all have all of their lifes energy  all of their hopes, their aspirations and all of their economic security and physical security invested in the network  theyre probably not gonna roll over and let you do it. Its pretty hard for one evil genius by themself to plot a trillion-dollar war on a cyber network. How are you gonna gather the software and the hardware and the monetary energy and the political support by yourself? And if youre not by yourself, Im reminded of the phrase, Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. [24:56] So when I think about Bitcoin I think, Its harder, but its harder because its an evolving herd creature, an evolving swarm creature. And its evolving as fast as it can, and it feels pain. As Nicholas Taleb says in Antifragile, Pain is a good thing! You can tell the difference between people that get it and people that dont get it. Theres a group of people in life that run from pain, and theyre attempting to anesthesize themselves and always isolate themselves from pain. And theres a group of people that run toward pain, or at least they embrace pain. Pains a good thing! The more pain you feel, the faster your reflexes. Put your hand on a hot stove, it moves quickly  you have reflexes. So that system is learning and pain is one of our number one information signals  maybe the most important information signal, in order to provide a living organism with vitality.", "image": null}

Yeah Taleb says that, Stressors and pain are indistinguishable from information at the organic level. That its the only way that an organic system learns is by exposure to something that is resistive or conflictive to it. And even at a genetic level, when a virus invades a host organism and destroys its cells, theres always a few cells that survive. And those cells that survive actually take some of the DNA from the virus that wiped out 99% of their cellular comrades and incorporates that DNA into its own such that it is resistant now to that virus. So its happening at an informational level even deep in biology. This isnt just something that happens kind of at the physical layer here. It happens really  its quintessential to life, is I guess the point Im getting at.", "image": null}

And I think that if its not a living thing, it cant be hard, it cant be hardest! People think gold is the hardest thing because its a rock, but it really isnt the hardest thing. The hardest thing is like the Mongolian horde if youre in its way. When the horde with 100,000 comes at you and theyre terrorizing, blood-curdling with their missiles  and if you read the history of Genghis Khan, they would ride across the plain, theyd find a city, the city is surrounded by a moat, they would go upriver and divert the river, they would divert the river, choke the city, starve them of water for three days, and theyd ride underneath the gates in the riverbed. Its just horrifying, blood-curdling, living horde creature. And you want to attack it? Its moving. You could go to it, retreat, they stop, they turn around, they throw you off balance, they murder you. Thats what happens when youre dealing with living creatures. Go into a hornets nest, attack the hornets with your revolver  see what happens. The most horrifying thing, right?

Therefore they will come at you with everything theyve got. Its almost just an unstoppable force. And it seems to me thats what youre facing when you face Bitcoin.

Those are gatekeepers and political financial systems and gatekeepers on the wall of China on a wall are literally gatekeepers. And the result is: one person has the power to destroy the lives of a million by opening the gate. Because Bitcoin doesnt have a gate theres no gatekeeper, therefore theres no asymmetric payoff. Its not economically feasible to break through. Now another big advantage in the antifragility of Bitcoin is this idea that I can run my own node, I can take my own keys off the network, I can choose to trust them with a custodian, or I can choose to take ownership of them myself, and I can choose for example to put a million dollars with a custodian thats going to run a bank or maybe lend it out or give me yield on it or protect it. But then at the point that I lose confidence in them, I can shift all those assets to another trustee, or I can take physical possession of them myself, and because you have lots of different entities  individuals and corporations  choosing to do different things at all times, even though someone might entrust their keys to a bank, the security of the entire system is being protected by the someone that doesnt! So the diversity with which people choose to engage and support the network actually makes it more antifragile. And the potentialfor example: if I know that you are gonna take possession of your keys, and then if you set up an organization thats custodians that will hold my keys and charge me 10 basis points, then if another organization charges me 50 basis points, I would just say to them, Im gonna shift to the 10 basis points. The competition drives their rate down or I move to 10 basis points. If I hear that your exchange or your custodian is not secure or it might not be secure, or if I heard that theres a new multisig protocol that more secure and I ask you and you dont support, I move my keys or I move my assets to the next wallet, the next technique. That means that you cannot afford to ignore me because you dont have a monopoly, right? Theres no regulator saying I have to leave my keys with the Breedlove Trust in order to get a tax deduction, or in order to qualify for a 501c3, 413, 509, etc. IRA, this or that. As you start to have pure competition, you get this ferocious evolution in all aspects of the ecosystem. And we saw it with miners for example: they started with CPUs, and they flipped to GPUs, and then they went to ASICs. And like every 3 years theres another generation. The thing that really destroys the quantum computing argument is, if anything, Bitcoin has proven that people that believe in the Bitcoin network are going to pursue the highest performance special-purpose client and server hardware before everybody else in the world! If you look at the state of the art with Bitcoin wallets, theyre more secure than any other mobile client device. And if you look at the state of the art with Bitcoin ASIC miners, theyre higher performance than AWS or any device youll find on a public cloud. And thats because Bitcoiners have skin in the game. Back to one of Nicholas Talebs books, its like everybody that writes the software, runs the software, uses the software  everybody has skin in the game. If you go to business its gonna be obliterated if you fall behind. As a miner you cant make any money. As a wallet you cant sell anything. As a crypto bank exchange  look how fast the money moves out of one exchange to another this week. Everybody has skin in the game, nobody can ignore the pain, agency bias is very hard to come by, and you can expect every year forever, its gonna get harder! Now back to this issue of Apple and Amazon: Apples the most valuable company on Earth because they can ship a software update to a billion people for a nickel. Thats pretty powerful! Well with Bitcoin, you can rewrite the software that runs the nodes to make it smarter, right? You can rewrite the software or the firmware that works on the mining devices. And so the hardware cycle  whats the upgrade cycle on hardware2 years maybe? 1, 2, 3 years? In that range. Whats the upgrade cycle on software? Well it depends on whether its the node or the client software  1, 2, 3, years. In the greater scheme of things, it doesnt have to be super fast, you just have to compare it to the number of hardware and software upgrade cycles on gold.", "image": null}

In 5 Billion years! Golds pretty much 5 Billion years  God made it, and left it that way. And theres a lesson to be learned from that, but the point is: its not upgrading, its not going to move. And if it doesnt move, invariably when human beings come in conflict with mountains, we move the mountains! We move the rivers, we chop up the granite. Go look at a citadel, its literally moved the mountain. You might have to move it 2 tons at a time. Look at the pyramids. 5,000 years ago someone figured out how to move a mountain of rock. And thats 5,0004,000 years ago! Are you gonna bet against 100,000 humans with their channeling gravity, channeling water, channeling whatever? Or are you gonna bet on the mountain? And the answer is: youre gonna bet on the human beings! When you roll forward and you look at human beings versus animals, its the same thing: us versus elephants, us versus lions, us versus nature  anything living. Generally we figure out how to beat it because we channel energy better! So now were talking about, What are we competing with here? Well, if were competing with gold it just seems like no contest whatsoever! Lets talk about smarter, stronger, and faster. Because harder is relevant to money, but smarter, stronger, and faster is the source of all tech value in the past 20 years  maybe in the past 2,000 years. Lets talk about smarter. Well if Bitcoin is programmable money  its a pure energy token and I can move it around  that means that I can write software on the clients and I can software on the server that will actually move the money. And that means you can hold keys to 100 Bitcoin and then you can write software that will prove that youre credit-worthy, that you own the keys to 100 Bitcoin. Then you can actually use it to register and certify a transaction or information or a title channeled into that. I can write a piece of software that will  what do I want? What if a million people wanted to borrow money pledging Bitcoin? And what if another million people wanted to loan out money and generate interest? And what if I write a program where everybody on one side says, Ill pay 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8% interest, and everybody on the other side says, Ill make a loan assuming a collateral coverage of 4:1 in Bitcoin and I can mark it to market every hour. Okay? Youre offering me terms, youre offering the loan, Im offering to borrow, we create a piece of software, it runs every day, every minute, every second. Robert, what if you had 10 Bitcoin and I scanned everybody  100 Million people  what if I scanned them today and I found someone willing to pay you 8% interest with a loan to value of 10% and you could mark it to market every minute? Good deal? Maybe! Maybe a good deal! Maybe you wouldnt be willing to loan it, but if you did  what if I went through all 100 Million of em and I found someone that needed the money real bad and would pay you 27% interest? Smart. Smart? What if I actually ran the algorithm every hour? What if I ran the algorithm every second? What if someone wants to borrow the money for a year and theyll pay you 10%? And what if they want to borrow for 30 years and theyll pay you 15%? What if they want to borrow for 1 year and theyll pay you 5%? What if they want to pay you overnight and theyll pay you x%? You could generate the yield curve with a piece of software, and then that software will connect all of the lenders with all of the borrowers on a server. It could be a centralized server. The logic doesnt have to be decentralized. In fact a centralized server runs a billion times faster than a proof of work network, so its likely that the logic will be smart, and thats an idea. Another idea is: put the intelligence on your iPhone and be able to talk to your iPhone and when I talk to my iPhone I can tell it to chop my money into 37 pieces and send it off  Send my money to my daughter and let her spend it on ice cream but not on Uber rides because I dont want her running off with her boyfriend somewhere. So I can condition the money using all manner of software, and I can turn on servers that will move my money around while Im sleeping, and I can turn on clients that will handle my money. And of course, if I walked into your bedroom and I picked up a gold bar and I walked out with it, the bars not gonna complain  its a dumb rock! On the other hand, if I took your Bitcoin and I wrapped your multi-factor authentication around it and your retina scan and your voice scan, I could geofence it and I could say, Nobody can move a mobile device with this Bitcoin key outside 100 meters of where Robert lives. You could do all sorts of magical crazy things with software that you cant do in mechanics  machines. So gold is in essence mechanical, and Bitcoin is virtual. And of course, its tokenized, and that means it can get as smart as the computer can get smart, and eventually the computers can talk to other computers and that opens up all sorts of applications like credit ratings, authenticity, insurance. Maybe I want to buy insurance for you but I want you to pledge the full value of my house and I want to know that you have the proof of the reserves to pay off the insurance, right? So you can create very interesting pieces of software with less risk or more transparency and more speed. We know it doesnt work with gold. It doesnt work with tokenized gold, because youve got the counterparty risk and you dont know whether the tokens actually are backed by real gold. It doesnt really work with other tokenized assets because stocks, bondsthey move too slow  and theres no API between the bonds and the tokens and if there was an API you end up with regulatory compliance issues and youre not delivering the physical instrument, ever. So thats just not likely to happen.", "image": null}

Its not adapting, its not changing. I wonder if  so today, to kind of change the lanes a little bit, the US Treasury is considered the risk-free rate in the world, being that it bears low to no interest, but it [presumably] has no risk of default, or the lowest risk of default. As you see us moving into more of a Bitcoin-denominated world, there have been talks of a risk-free rate for Bitcoin developing on the Lightning Network, such that you would fund these Lightning channels in time-locked contracts that the market would determine  anywhere from a minute to 30 years  and it would bear some interest rate. Do you think thats the direction the risk-free rate goes? Is that how we develop a Bitcoin yield curve? Or how do you see that evolving?", "image": null}

I think on a chain like Lightning above the base chain  by the way you could do it with a centralized or a decentralized solution, right? So Lightning is one solution, but you could do it on any exchange too if they chose to do it. Theres a lot of ways to solve the problem. The key idea is to create a free market yield curve. Rational people of their own volition would never willingly loan you for 30 years for 1.4% interest. There is no person that would think thats a good idea to do it. In a free market you would expect that you would see  30-year rates would definitely be north of 10-year rates and north of 1-year rates  you would see things like 3, 4% short term, 5, 6% 10-year, 8% long term risk-free rates. And thats what they used to be! When Volcker finished his work and he kind of like reset everything, for a while  the conventional wisdom back in the 80s was the long term risk-free rate was about 78% and then the risk premium was 4% and so the cost of capital was about 12% on making an investment. And thats how they came at it. And the interest rates typically mirrored that  you could get a savings account for 45%  anywhere from 48% on the yield curve. Its only state intervention that will deflect it below that. We could talk about that when we get to interest, but thats my thinking on that. With regard to Bitcoin as an asset, we talked about why its harder and why its smarter  because you can program it  but its also stronger. And the stronger is an important thing. Strong is about channeling energy with force and acceleration. I walk into the ringwere gonna fight. If I punch slowly, I could be strong. But if Im slow I dont win! The fighters that win have explosive force. You could be stronger than me but I can strike you before you strike me I can knock you out. And so its all about how explosively you can channel that energy. And thats what an arrow is, or a sling, or a bullet. Its not the guy thats the biggest, strongest, fastest, that wins  its the guy that puts a bullet in your head first that wins. And so we know that in military combat. If we think about stronger in the context of money, its all about channeling monetary energy with force and acceleration. So that means on a Saturday afternoon from a standing start, if you have $10 Million, can you figure out where to put the $10 Million to generate the most yield? Like, I need software! If I had $10 Million in gold, I cant do anything with it on a Saturday afternoon. On the other hand, if I have $10 Million of Bitcoin and I wrap it with a server, and if the server scans through 1,000 institutional counterparties and then I finance the bid, then I could chop my $10 Million of Bitcoin into 10 pieces. I could send $1 Million to Tokyo, $1 Million to Beijing, Berlin, London. I could leave some of it outstanding for a 1-week loan, some for a 1-month loan, some for a 1-year loan. If their circumstances change  if youre pledging some other kind of collateral and Im marking it to market and it changes, I could snatch back my assets. And so the ability to channel the energy and move it where I need to move it intelligently, fast  what if I make you a loan of $1 Million at 12% interest on Saturday, and then you come back to me 4 minutes later and you want another million and youll pay me 12% more? And what if I like your credit? In the virtual world, in the Bitcoin world, I can just send another million! What if you come back and say, Okay Ill take $10 Million and give you 14%  I just need it for 3 days? 3 hours? Thats [fast], right? You cant do that with gold, ever! And if I had a bond or Apple stock or something like that on a Saturday, its not moving! But realisticallyIm giving you an extreme example because its kind of magical that your computer server is making you money by scanning the networks on a Saturday afternoonwell I dont have to be that extreme. For example, if you have $100 Million of Apple stock sitting with the wire house, a big bank  pick up the phone and tell them you found someone thats willing to give you 3% interest on the Apple stock  they would laugh at you! Ha ha ha, ha ha ha!Well we dont give interest on that! Well could you just like loan it out to this other party thats willing to give me  ha ha ha, no. Whens the last time you got interest on your stock assets from the bank or the trustee thats holding the stock? Never! They dont do it! Okay so lets go through the thought experiment: You have $100 Million in cash, you put it in a savings account back in 1988 that gives you 5% interest. You have $100 Million and you put it into Apple stock and they give you a dividend. Okay good. Now the bank loans your Apple stock to someone thats gonna short the Apple stock, they short it, they sell it for $100 Million, they take their cash, they put it into something yielding 5% interest, they keep the 5%  what you get? Nothing! Your Apple stock got hypothecated, you didnt get paid, and yet if you had $100 Million in a market basket of stocks, why shouldnt you get a yield on it? The reason you dont get a yield on it is because conventional financial industry doesnt have an incentive to do it nor a need to do it, they just [have the power? 52:03] and you dont! And what causes people to do that is competition. Sometimes by the way [the reason you dont see] competition across regulatory domain is because if I can get all the regulators in my country to agree that we wont do this then its collusion and regulatory capture. And so when you have a cross-domain asset, its less likely youd have regulatory capture. Ultimately, the strength of Bitcoin comes from the fact that an individual can self-custody and so if the individual can custody and they can do it in any of 200 different regulatory jurisdictions, they can find a jurisdiction where they will have the strongest money where they can generate the most yield and they can move to that jurisdiction. Whereas youre not gonna be able to convince that mega [inaudible 52:58] bank to move to that jurisdiction and give you the most favorable terms, because they have no interest in that. So thats what stronger is all about. And then faster comes back to the idea that weve dematerialized the gold, and because weve dematerialized the gold theres no mass. And if E=MC and the M goes to zero, then we get the C with very little E! Well at least get the C. We can actually get to the speed of light because we have no mass, and when we think about $100 Million of gold, back to my 3,000 lb metaphor, thats $250,000 every time you go around the Earth  so what if I want to send it around the Earth every week? Every day? Every hour?", "image": null}

And so faster means that I can send it at the speed of light, and if I can send it at the speed of light, then theres all sorts of high-frequency transactions and microtransactions that make sense now that never made sense before. How about a world where one rich person makes loans to 10,000 middle class people every week? Thats inconceivable with gold. Thats not possible with stocks or bonds. Because sometimes its regulatory compliance issues, or it might be systems issues, right? But it is possible to imagine with Bitcoin  someone will just create the eBay of social finance. What about one rich person that wants to lend money to 10 institutions? What about 10 institutions that want to work with each other? Ultimately, the things that make something slow, it might be physical mass like the weight of gold that makes it slow, it might be impedance, and the impedance might be a systems impedance. Like its Friday afternoon and I cannot move money between 4pm on Friday and 9:30am on Monday. Thats a systems impedance  its not a law, its just a custom. And if its on Thanksgiving or Christmas well then that doesnt count either. And then theres compliance: there is a law. There might be a regulation in a city, a state, or a country, that keeps the energy from moving. There might be a system that keeps the energy from moving. Or there just might be laws of conservation of mass that keeps the energy from moving. And so by moving out of that domain into the cyber domain, you get speed, which is somewhere in the order of 1,000 to 1 Billion times faster! You put all those together: something thats just continually getting  and by the way, its getting smarter every year, right? Weve all seen on Google the computers beat humans on chess playing. The computers are all beating us all on everything. The algorithms just keep getting smarter. Wouldnt you like an algorithm that figured out how to make you money while youre sleeping? Because I would! Programmed trading, right? The manifestation is programmed trading right now! And the issue is: consumers dont have the power of programmed trading algorithms to protect their financial interest when their financial, their monetary energy is denominated in traditional assets because they cant plug their assets into that new system.", "image": null}

So that was Episode 6 of Michael Saylor here in the Saylor Series. And wow. What can I say? Were just addressing Bitcoin from every side and putting it in the context of technological development on the whole  as an essentialas all technologies develop, essentially were really putting Bitcoin in that context. Again if you havent seen the earlier episodes please go check them out because a lot of this hearkens back to that and I mean I hope youre enjoying it, I just think its getting so good. So as Saylor goes into, Bitcoin is a better tool because its harder, smarter, stronger, and faster than gold. And gold historically is the best monetary technology the world has ever had. And we go into this a number of ways. The one very obvious instance thats most often discussed in Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is the hardest money that has ever been. Meaning that it has the highest stock to flow ratio, or said differently the lowest inflation rate  that ones obvious. Weve touched on that one a lot. But another way to look at it is that Bitcoin is also the hardest money thats ever existed because its the most adaptive to entropy. Its the most antifragile money weve ever had, if not the only antifragile money weve ever had. And Saylor gives a great example when he talks about a fragile versus an antifragile defense with the Great Wall of China. So the Great Wall of China was a static defense, it had a single point of failure, and despite all the effort that went into building and securing that perimeter, the Mongols were able compromise one of the gates, and thats all it took! The rest of the wall didnt matter so long as you could compromise a single point. And I think this is very interesting because its pointing to the fact that gatekeepers and gates are weaknesses. They are single points of failure in a standard, static defense like that. And I really liked the quote  I forgot who said it, Philip II of Macedonia perhaps  but he said that, No citadel is impenetrable if I can fit a donkey with a pot of gold up a road leading to it. Meaning that the defense itself doesnt necessarily matter if there is a gate or a gatekeeper because you can bribe the gatekeeper! And this is another way that Bitcoins outcompeting the legacy system because the legacy system is built on gatekeepers! Thats what central banks are, thats what governments are  theyre all just gatekeepers for these flows of economic vitality or monetary energy. And theyre all siphoning it in a tax or a transaction fee with every movement. But Bitcoin as we know doesnt have any gatekeepers, and in fact Bitcoiners are actively engaging with gatekeepers in the legacy system every day to negotiate better deals with regulators, energy producers, users, businesses in the space, etc. So I think this is a really important point, that gatekeepers are a weakness, and Bitcoin suffers no gatekeepers! That is a breakthrough that it is the first fully disintermediated money. We can just transact peer-to-peer. So that may sound kind of like a nerdy abstraction but its really fundamentally important in terms of defending the monetary energy. The other point too going to the antifragility aspect is that the best defense is an adaptive defense, one that responds to the nature of the threat and the character of the aggressor in ways that adapt and respond to changes of circumstances. And I think this is very interesting with Bitcoin because the more the market cap grows, the more monetary energy is stored on its network, the more incentivized all network participants are to defend it, to defend the 21 Million hard cap for instance, or to defend fungibility or privacy at higher layers and to figure things out on behalf of Bitcoin. Everyones fate in Bitcoin is intertwined and everyones pointed in the same direction. And I think this is heavily discounted in the price in my opinion! Bitcoiners are by nature very adversarial thinkers, but what we dont often consider in the network design iswe look at worst-case scenarios all the time  but we fail to account for how highly motivated Bitcoiners actually are to defend the network and to defend the ecosystem. And I would argue even in the market price of Bitcoin this is highly discounted. Bitcoin on balance is relatively highly discounted because its just so misunderstood. But I would say even those that understand Bitcoin fail to account for this properly. Again, all of these highly motivated network participants all engaging with other market participants in the broader market, making better deals, and feeding capital into Bitcoin  in that way everyone ends up on Bitcoins payroll in a way  once you become a HODLer you have these huge incentives to defend the network, to evangelize, to educate, to build businesses in this space. So its just a radical vortex of incentives that bootstraps and protects itself. And thats why so many people call Bitcoin a living thing. And to Saylors point, to be truly hard and antifragile, the system needs to be alive. It needs to be adaptive, it needs to respond spontaneously to changes in the environment. And for an antifragile organism, by definition, when you kill any part of the antifragile organism  even if you kill 99% of it  and you dont destroy all of it, then whatever pain inflicted on that animal, its going to generate a response to that and its going to come back stronger. So thats what antifragility is, its the ability to become hardened through hostility. We see this in most organisms but Brandon Quittem has written about this a lot comparing Mycelium to Bitcoin in that its this decentralized network archetype. Its learning at the edges by having conflicts with different adversarial characters and yet incorporating those learnings into the whole of the organism. And Bitcoin is very similar. So in the sphere of money Bitcoin is the first and only antifragile money weve ever had. And if you havent read Talebs book by that title, Antifragile, one of the best books Ive ever read. Ive read it twice. Its really hard to stop something thats antifragile. Antifragile things or organisms or organizations or tools, they dominate the world. They live in a universe pervaded by entropy. Uncertainty is always unfolding in real time. The things that can adapt best to that uncertainty and learn from it the most quickly become dominant. Thats just a principle of the universe. So thats a lot to chew on and a lot to get your head around, but when you come to see Bitcoin in that light I think it makes a compelling case for it. And again its Bitcoin  this antifragile beast  going up against gold, something that doesnt feel pain, inspiration, motivation. Its an inorganic commodity. And also going up against fiat currency, which is probably the most fragile institution in history. The one certainty that we know about fiat currency is that it collapses time and time again. Then we got into another aspect of Bitcoins hardness, and that is  it has this diversity of custodianship and custody schemas that weve never before seen in any other asset. And again this is because Bitcoin is just pure information. The switching costs for custodianship are very low, and that threat of self-custody  to Saylors point  it always forces custodians to behave honestly. And to deliver custodial services that are very high quality at a very low price. So its very frictionless to move your capital from one custodian to another  its what keeps everyone honest and competitive. It imposes this free-market paradigm. The way Ive described that before too is the five properties of money. Bitcoin is optimized for perfected portability because its pure information. So its just information, it can move at the speed of light. And because its just information that can move at the speed of light and its massless, you can code it into so many different hard to find custody schemes. Theres people that have put their private keys into a song or written it into a public article that only they know how to decode. So its just radically new and interesting in terms of how you can safeguard this asset. And then we got into a bit of this specter of quantum computer, its one of the most popular ways to discredit Bitcoin. Everyone says, Oh when quantum computing breaks through, Bitcoins over with! First of all its totally ignorant of the fact that if quantum computing did actually occur it would break all of the commercial Internet as we know it: everything thats protected under cryptography would be rendered useless essentially. So there are massive incentives even outside of Bitcoin to develop quantum resistant encryption in response to a quantum computing breakthrough. But the other point Saylor makes is that Bitcoiners live at the vanguard of this space and they have, again, north of $300 Billion of market cap to protect, and they are interacting with these client server hardware implementations on a daily basis, especially on the mining network. So theyre gonna be the first to see or smell or detect this type of breakthrough coming through and theyll be the first to adapt! So we left off talking about Bitcoins hardware and software update cycles and how they compare to other forms of money. With Bitcoin the hardware refresh cycle for mining hardware specifically tends to be around 13 years. Its sometimes a little more extended the closer were getting to the 4-year halving cycle. But as more producers enter the space  producing ASICs  that cycle is subject to change. But the point is that the hardware protecting the Bitcoin network is always being refreshed. Whether its 1 or 4 years. And then the software cycles for Bitcoin vary as well depending on whether its node or mining software. That tends to take place within the scope of a year. Regardless, when you compare this to gold, gold is a dumb shiny rock. It undergoes zero hardware or software updates in its 5,000-year use as money. Bitcoin is just so much faster in that respect. Again its constantly adapting to new circumstances at a rate to which gold could never hope to do because gold does not have hardware or software  it does not adapt at all. And that hearkens back to the example Saylor gave: Which one are you gonna choose to bet on? Are you gonna choose the mountain? The static mountain? Or are you gonna bet on the humans that encounter that mountain? Humans that can adapt, develop new tools and ways and innovations of moving the mountain and destroying the mountain. Were back to this static defense versus an active offense. If the defense is unable to adapt to the dynamic nature of the aggressor then its always going to lose! When humans encounter that mountain with this swarm intelligence of ingenuity, were figuring out how to drill holes into the rock, plant dynamite in there, blow it up, clear it out, build a road through it. So were pointing to where its better to place your chips. Whether its on the static defense of something like gold or the dynamic defense of something like Bitcoin. Then we got into how money, specifically Bitcoin versus gold and fiat  its much stronger, smarter, and faster. And these aspects, as weve touched on early in this series, theyre actually the source of all innovational and evolutional value. Again, the reason mankind dominates the world is because hes able to coordinate his efforts with others and harness energy and tools in a way that makes him smarter, faster, stronger, than all other creatures in the world. Thats what were doing with innovation! Were not physically becoming faster, stronger, smarter necessarily, although we do become smarter, clearly. But our collective efforts are becoming smarter, stronger, faster, is the point there. This reminds me of that quote Saylor brought up early in the series that as far as he can tell, Mankind is the only animal that plays with fire. So we figured outwere able to self-reflect on the nature of the natural universe and figured out how to harness its gifts and allocate them towards our ends. And that makes us very very unique. This gets into Mises. Mises is one of the fathers of Austrian Economics. He wrote a great book called Human Action. And in Human Action he describes the science of praxeology, which is actually the study of purpose-driven behavior. And its: man always takes action with means towards ends. So everything is a means or an ends to man! But things themselves are not means. This table is just a materialist item in the universe, but it becomes means when I allocate my purpose into resting my computer on this table. So we have this very special gift of projecting our intellect into the universe and then actually channeling energy through it. That makes us just radically different than all the other animals. So to get back to money, in terms of how Bitcoin is smarter: first of all its programmable. You can imaginethe example he gave was being able to write some automated software that actually created a marketplace for Bitcoin lending and borrowing. And this is a super interesting aspect because it actually has the possibility of facilitating a yield curve for Bitcoin. Yield curve simply means typically a market-based time series that shows you the rate of return you can get on capital by lending it out. Anywhere from 130 years in the case of US treasuries. That is the last element Bitcoin lacks to become a truly preferable global store of value. Thats the one thing that US treasuries and other government bonds currently have over Bitcoin is that they have a built-in yield. Ive had some talks with people in Lightning Labs about this. I actually think that could be the route this goes. And if we can develop these time-locked Lightning smart contracts where people are actually putting Bitcoin into a time-locked channel to facilitate Lightning Network liquidity, and then the markets matching that demand for Bitcoin borrow with an interest rate yield  maybe theyre getting a piece of the transaction fees for the routing fees through Lightning Network. That time series set of smart contracts could become the Bitcoin yield curve that actually leads Bitcoin to becoming this long contemplated pristine collateral, which US treasuries serve the purpose of today. In fact this actually points to another way to think about hard money. If youre holding gold on a gold standard or youre holding Bitcoin on a Bitcoin standard, that money tends to appreciate roughly approximate to the aggregate productivity growth of the world, because again its holding its scarcity, so as goods and services become relatively more abundant, that moneyholding demand constant  would fetch more goods and services. So if the global GDP is growing at 3% per year, we would expect that on a hard money standard, the hard money itself would grow at about 3% per year. So this is really interesting because that makes hard money on a hard money standard similar to a non-counterparty investment in an index fund invested in global equities. Its like whatever business is doing whatever in the world to create more goods and services, this hard money that Im holding with no counterparty risk  its a bearer asset so Im holding it, Im custodying it, Im not subject to default risk with anyone else  it actually acts as a passive index investment in all of those global equities creating more goods and services! Thats just another way to think about it that I thought was really interesting. Another way that Bitcoins smarter is that its more defensible. With gold you could put it into a vault, you could secure it with armed guard, put it in a fortress  whatever. But Bitcoins unique in that it can be wrapped in technology layers of security. So you can wrap it in 2FA, Face ID, biometrics, geofencing  all of these unique software-enabled security schemes are only possible with something like Bitcoin. With gold its just not possible because gold will always suffer from the oracle problem. Youll always need to ultimately trust the custodian of the gold at the end of that chain of security features. Whereas Bitcoin can actually be directly integrated with the software security features. So then looking at Bitcoin as stronger money: to clarify we dont mean strong like Bitcoin can benchpress a lot of weight, what we mean is channeling energy with force and acceleration. So forcefully channeling energy. Thats what a gun is, right? A gun is one of the strongest offensive technologies because it can repel a bullet with more force and acceleration than a sling or a bow, so a gun is preferred. But in the realm of money its all about channeling monetary energy with force and acceleration into the right place and the right time to generate yield, as we were talking about earlier with the lending market. And this is yet another way Bitcoin is superior to inferior stores of value like gold or equities, because with equities your custodian is gonna hold it, they may be lending your stock to short-sellers and generating yield for themselves. But as an industry standard they do not share that yield with you at all! They also do other weird things like rehypothecation and naked short selling and all types of fraud that are just industry norm today. But with Bitcoin, since it has such a high degree of mobility and visibility, you actually could demand that your custodian lend it to short sellers or do different things  put it into different buckets of risk to create yield for yourself as you see fit. And thats just something that you dont have the option to do with gold or with equities. Because Bitcoin is so mobile, its this cross domain asset you can settle with finality anywhere near instantly. Its highly resistant to custodial collusion and regulatory capture, where the reason you dont get yield on your equities right now  whereas the bank does  is theyve colluded and made that an industry practice! So Bitcoin, by being this near-instant means of final settlement, its collapsing the event of trade with the event of settlement, and it is between those events in traditional finance where all corruption and systemic risk accumulate. Because you can execute a trade but you dont have to settle with say T+3 or T+5 depending on the asset. And between those times a lot of games are played on Wall Street and in the broader financial landscape! Bitcoin closes that window. Trade and settlement are now effectively the same thing  you can demand final settlement 24/7 from anywhere in the world to anywhere in the world. So it just again speaks to Bitcoins incorruptible character. Finally getting into how Bitcoins faster: as Saylor described it, weve essentially dematerialized gold, so weve taken the monetary properties of gold but weve transitioned them into a tool thats fully dematerialized, purely informational. And when you look at that through the Einsteinian equation lens of E=MC, weve taken M to zero  its massless  so what were left with is this massless money that can be moved at the speed of light! And thats just radically new and interesting. And as we talked about earlier its also related to the security aspects. Because its pure information you can do a lot of really unique things with it that just arent possible with any other asset. So this dematerialization of money, it enables a plethora of high frequency and microtransactions that were simply not possible in the past. And the other thing is that again all of these gatekeepers in traditional finance are the ones taking the vig on market participants, but in Bitcoin we have this economic network thats bigger than even money  its a global economic network that has almost no gatekeeping essentially, if youre just transacting peer-to-peer, and therefore has much lower transaction and taxation costs which means there are just less frictions to free trade overall. So this thing is just moving capital much more quickly and with much less friction and impedance. So all this means for market participants  for Bitcoin HODLers  is they have more optionality, theyre gonna benefit from more aggregate wealth creation, and the wealth that they do create through this enhanced free trade, they can actually store it in a medium and preserve that wealth in essentially a theft-proof form, or a highly resistant to confiscation form. So all of these things just make Bitcoin much faster and much more securable and when you compare that to something like fiat you just cant move that off business hours, on holidays, and between countries unless youre suffering high fees. Theres KYC/AML delays, theres just all of these frictions to doing business. Whereas Bitcoin you can just send it to anyone, from anywhere in the world, to anywhere in the world at any time of day, and that is just a radical enhancement to the speed or velocity aspects of money! That in a nutshell  Bitcoin being smarter, stronger, faster, and harder than any other money in history  is why Bitcoin is freedom money! It is a form of value communication, a language of value if you will, that cannot be muted or manipulated. A guy I talked with today actually called it a super-language object, which I think is interesting! Weve collapsed a lot of things into speech in the digital age, if you think say the 3D printing of firearms, we would say thats a 2nd Amendment right, the right to bear arms in the US. But weve now collapsed that into the 1st Amendment because code is speech. And Bitcoin interestingly enough has collapsed money into speech, so something really big is going on here! And Bitcoin is at the center of it. And I hope this episode helps show you some of that. Im excited for the next one. This is Episode 6, weve got 3 left and well see you next time!", "image": null}

Welcome to Episode 5 of The Saylor Series here on the What is Money? Show! Super excited for this one! This is episode 2 of us getting into Bitcoin theory, and things are just starting to really heat up and get interesting at this point! So its a big episode  I dont want to waste a lot of your time here, Im just gonna run through a few of the topics that well be hearing today. If you havent checked out Episodes 14 yet I suggest you do, because a lot of the foundation that weve been building upon up until this point really starts to throw off some good energy here! So today were going to be talking about money as power, also, talking about one of my favorite ways to describe money is as an insurance policy on the uncertainty or the entropy of the future. And then well also be looking at debt and how its actually a form of anti-energy. And then Saylor delivers a really interesting take on fiat currency in that its a way of politically toxifying money, and he drops some really interesting analogies there that I think youre gonna like. And then were gonna deliver a thought experiment that I think is a really simple way of clarifying the value proposition of Bitcoin and its superiority as a store of value in comparison to all other assets. Maybe something you can use in your own arguments with precoiners. And then were gonna be talking about some lessons of history and how essentially the most organized group of people tend to win out. Were gonna be looking at store of value versus medium of exchange in terms of monetary functionality. Were gonna look at the utility of money and how that tends to drive its market value. Were also gonna look at the productivity of market participants in a monetary network and how that drives market value. And then finally were gonna look at Bitcoin as  you know, what Ive argued in the past and what we get into a bit here  is that Bitcoin is an American technology! Now I do not mean America the nation state, like it was invented in America, I mean the idea of America: the principles of free market capitalism. Bitcoin positively embodies them. Saylor and I get into a unique discussion on that topic. And then well look at and compare and contrast the nature of fiat currency inflation and Bitcoin appreciation and see how theyre polar-opposite forces. And then we conclude by diving into some philosophy! Were talking a bit about truth and how Bitcoin relates to truth and civilizations relationship with truth. So, big episode today, excited for you guys to see this! Lets jump in!", "image": null}
{"title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-5-channeling-monetary-energy-across-time-and-space-92f68a8327ea?source=user_profile---------19-------------------------------", "body": "Michael Saylor [06:10]: Were talking about Bitcoin as the first digital monetary network! Im positing this thought experiment: I have a $100 Million block of energy. I can generate $100 Million worth of energy through chemical processes, kinetic, gravitational, electrical, atomic power. Lets just assume that I did some amount of work in order to generate that energy. I converted that energy into money. Money is the highest form of energy! Now Ive got $100 Million block of money! You can do a lot with $100 Million! It equates to about 3,000 lbs worth of gold, it converts to $100 Million of currency, and we could do the calculation in Bitcoin  a little bit less than 10,000 Bitcoin at this point in time. Now, I want to do two things with it: I want to channel it through time, and I want to channel it through space. The beauty of Bitcoin channeling through time is that there really is no loss over time, theres no inflation. Youve only got the 21 Million Bitcoin, so as a ratio to 21 Million its infinitely hard! And so thats a big check, and if we contrast it to gold and fiat: youre gonna lose 99.5% of your energy in fiat. Youre gonna lose 98% of your energy in gold. Youre gonna keep all your energy in Bitcoin! So clearly, channeling energy through time is important and its critical. Channeling it through space really refers not just to moving it around the world, but it means moving it across domains at well from counterparty to counterparty. We can see the inefficiencies in fiat counterparty to counterparty is: youre locked into 9-to-5 banking hours, you cant do big transactions on a Saturday, there are certain jurisdictions where you cant do transactions at all, youre always working through a counterparty which is its own risk. And of course if we go to gold, fiat is faster, but its still got complexities. Gold is slower  its gonna take a month to physically deliver gold, and so: super slow, super expensive. Neither fiat nor gold make nearly so much sense for channeling energy through time and space! I think that the best metaphor when I think about this is its like I want to cross from London to New York City and I need to cross the Atlantic  and thats the journey. And if Im gonna do it with fiat currency its like a big rubber raft with a leak in it, and Im gonna be continually blowing up that raft every day to keep it from sinking on me! And Im going to get battered this way and that way, and its a bit of a venture! On the other hand with gold, its like getting in a wooden ship. And its gonna rot over the course of many many years, but maybe for the first 2, 3, 4, 5, years  compared to the rubber raft  I feel pretty good! But its a heavy ship! Wood is heavier than rubber, so its kind of harder to get going and its harder to maneuver it but its a bit more solid. But ultimately its organic and its going to decay! And then if I put it into a crypto container  a Bitcoin  its like a steel vessel. I have a steel hull  a steel hull container ship really, is the best metaphor  1,000 feet long, 60 feet wide, moves 30 knots! The thing thats special about steel is: steel is indestructible as long as you maintain it! The maintenance means: you have to keep it from corroding! It can be attacked by a corrosion, and the way you maintain it is you paint it. You sand it down every 510 years, you repaint it. If you maintain it, it will last longer than you will last! In fact it will last essentially forever  hundreds of years! If you punch a hole in a steel hull and then you weld it, the weld is stronger than the original steel. So it is the indestructible, extremely strong, repairable element. And it doesnt take a rocket scientist to figure out that if youre going to actually engage in commerce all around the world, you want a bunch of steel container ships! You do not want wooden ships, and you certainly dont want inflatables! And thats the distinction and thats why Bitcoin is really such an extraordinary invention! We talked about getting out of the gravity well  the other metaphor is: I have $100 Million worth of energy. If I can get it into a vacuum and vacuum seal itits like when we want to keep food forever we vacuum seal the foodwe want to keep bacteria from attacking it. We want to keep natural parasites and pathogens from attacking our food energy! And so the way that you protect your food energy and stabilize it forever is you vacuum seal it! And the way you protect your monetary energy from parasites and from decay and from rotting is you vacuum seal it! And that is the genius of Bitcoin! When I say that the destiny is to be encrypted, its like vacuum sealing your food. Youre taking monetary energy in fiat that can decay, debase, diffuse, and youre encrypting it in an encrypted container such that no one else can touch it, no one else can screw with it. And when you think about all these miners, these miners are power plants, theyre plugged into analog energy, but theyre modulating the analog, physical, pure energy through the SHA-256 protocol to make it a wall of encrypted energy, if not a cloud of encrypted energy and the rails of encrypted energy! If you want to pass through that, if you want to attack that, you have to go through that wall of SHA-256 encrypted energy! And all of our monetary energy is protected and floating in the cloud behind that wall! And its a fairly unique wall. And thats the majesty of Bitcoin.", "image": null}

And I guess that takes us to our next interesting question, which is: So how big can the Bitcoin network get? And how is it going to absorb more power? Im measuring: money is power by the way, the cliche, Money is Power, its not a cliche!  its a deep reality! Money is the highest form of power, the superset of all power. Kinetic energy?I can take bows and arrows and guns, club you to death and take your money  take your value! With a war, I can convert kinetic energy into power. Atomic energy into power. Chemical energy I can burn and create power. Gravitational energy  dam a river and create power. And ultimately that power becomes money! But I cant do the opposite maybe I can do the opposite  I can take a money and I can convert it back into the other things. But money is the amalgam of all powers that mankind has managed to collect! And so the question really is: How much money, how much power can fall into Bitcoin? And theres a lot of debate in the community. For example the most famous model is the S2F model. And a lot of Bitcoiners talk about stock to flow and its like, Well, as Bitcoin gets harder, its price is going up! Well I mean the power in the network is directly proportional to the price because its equal to 21 Million times the price! Thats the power in the network! You could almost think of it as a voltage or something too  the higher the voltage, the more energy passes through the electrical network. So I see the price as the voltage, and I think that its stock to flow is an interesting transcendental model  a particular model  as were moving through a short period, early history of Bitcoin, where the rate of block rewards is falling dramatically! But I think that as you look toward the future of the chain as it asymptotically goes to 21 Million and as the block rewards go to zero and the entire network flips over to transaction fees, then you start to think, Well just because its hard, thats not gonna explain why its valuable! [16:50] Its hard to synthesize Polonium or Uranium! By the way, its really hard to create steel! Really hard! Like steel power plants, if the steel overflows, it hits the concrete, it blows up  kills everybody! Its hard to deal with nitroglycerin. Theres a lot of hard things in the world. And theres some things that are nearly impossible  I will probably never walk on the sun! Impossible! But, the impossibility of something doesnt make it valuable. What makes it valuable is some other dynamics! And I have a simple model, and I Tweeted this model the other day: I think the success of Bitcoin and the network power ultimately is a function of the adoption, the utility, the productivity, and the inflation. Those four. And theyre big brand concepts that are vectors, theyre not like one number  theyre ideas! But the adoption idea is: a monetary network is gonna be as big as the amount of asset holders that adopt it as their primary treasury reserve asset. So for example: if a million people with $100 each decide to HODL their $100 and they put $100 Million into Bitcoin, the Bitcoin networks worth $100 Million! If a company $100 Million decides to HODL their $100 Million in Bitcoin, the lowbrow or the historic colloquial term is HODL  Hold On for Dear Life or just HODL or save, whatever  and the highbrow term would be, Adopt as a treasury reserve asset!", "image": null}

And if I was just a Bitcoin maximalist, I loved it and I got it  Im HODLing! And thats why I love the HODLers! Thats why theyre my people  I love them! Theyre HODLing! And they figured it out before I figured it out! And I give them credit: they figured it out and thats genius! But Im not too proud to learn. Some other  you gotta believe, if I looked a million years ago and some dude comes up with fire, Im like, Im not the guy thats gonna say, Im not doing that  that wasnt my idea! Could I borrow some of that fire, Sir? And thank you! Thank you, for bringing life to me! So, adoption: the number of individuals and the number of entities that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset  not measured in numbers, measured in monetary energy in whatever US dollar equivalents, but theyre converting their fiat (Euros, Yen, Pesos, Dollars)  the total US dollar amount of fiat that is converted into Bitcoin for the purposes of holding as a treasury reserve asset! You see that the traders, the speculators  theyre short term interesting, but over the long term they dont really have any value to the network, right? Someone thats going to buy $1 Million of Bitcoin today and sell it tomorrow? Theyre not going to drive network energy, because theyre going to rob the network of energy as fast as they fed the network. They are mercenaries! The Roman Empire was built on citizen soldiers willing to fight and die to protect what they believed in! At the point that youre hiring mercenaries to fight and not die as long as you pay them  your empires over! So, the HODLers  people that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset  theyre citizens of Bitcoin! Theyre citizens of the network! And if you decide its 20% of your treasury reserves  like, its a matter of faith! How committed are you? If you really committed like, say, Microstrategy  I had $500 Million worth of money I didnt need! I had two choices: I can buy the stock back or buy Bitcoin with it. Well I bought as much stock back as the shareholders wanted to sell to us, because that was the appropriate, respectful thing to do  to put a tender offer! And then whatevers left, we convert! The treasury is our reserve asset, which is our reserve energy! It is our life force! Treasury is life force! Its not unlike fat. Fat is natures organic battery. You carry 30 lbs of fat, that means youll probably be able to live an extra 6090 days without food when the going gets tough! And so its an organic battery. A treasury is an organic battery. Or its a monetary battery for a family, an individual, a company, or a country! You have no treasury? Youre gonna die very quickly when the crisis hits! Youre gonna be insolvent!", "image": null}

Whatever youre holding it in is basically an insurance policy on the uncertainty of the future! Because this cash balance or this treasury reserve gives you pure optionality in the marketplace, youre best able to contend with unforeseen developments! Another thing, just to jump back to the power and money relationship, I think its very interesting to look at power through the physics definition. Physics defines power as work over time! Thats what gold was: it was reflective of our collective work over time, and it was a claim on that work over time in the form of capital! And the other thingyou were drawing the analogy to the vacuum sealing to protect it from parasites  I think we could all agree that work is kind of the opposite of theft, right? You dont create any value by theft, you just steal the value of others work. And thats essentially what inflation is! So, money being power, theres a big incentive to store it in a medium that is as much protected from theft as possible! And I think thats getting to the core value proposition of what Bitcoin represents!", "image": null}

Its an encrypted energy crucible in which we store the precious energy of life! And were insulating it via an encrypted vacuum layer from all the things that would bleed off or steal that heat or steal the energy, be it a political exchange or just physical  there are a lot of ways to lose the energy of life! And Bitcoin solves that problem! Now how do we get energy into this system? There are a lot of metaphors for heat exchange, and if you look at closed systems, a closed system in thermodynamics is: mass cannot leave or enter  only heat! So lets assume that 21 Million Bitcoin is the massit cannot leave or enter! Heat can come! If Im buying Bitcoin at a price higher than the rolling 3-year average, or the rolling 200-week average  Im heating it up! And if Im selling it at a price lower than the rolling average for whatever time frame you care about  lets say that 4 years is your time reference frame  if Im selling it at a price lower than the 200-week moving average, Im cooling it down! So people see Bitcoin trading day-to-day, and theyre like, Oh its lower than yesterday! Thats not what I see! I see it as: If its trading at $10,000 and the 200-week rolling average was $7,000, I see it heating up! I see its capacitor gathering energy! And thats a very important way to think of it. Now we come back to this issue of adoption: you can adopt Bitcoin with varying degrees of commitment. Its like joining a religion, right? So I adopt Bitcoin as my treasury reserve asset, and then do I commit 50% of my reserves to it? Or 1%? Or 99%? Or 100%? What is the true adoption rate? How much do you really believe it? Is it a hedge? Is it a 1% hedge  la Paul Tudor Jones? Or is it a 100% commitment  la Michael Saylor? Right? I said, No hedge! No speculation! 100% commitment! Just like your body is 100% committed to storing excess energy in fat! 100% commitment! Theres no other thing! I like your analogy of an insurance policy, except that I would say: an all-powerful insurance policy with no caveats! Because the problem with most insurance policies is: I have an insurance policy on my restaurant, but it doesnt cover pandemics! And so Im bankrupt! Have you noticed how many insurance policies are not paying off in the pandemic? Because theres a carve-out: Well we only insure against a  only if this happens and that happens, and if you didnt do this and if nobody said that and if the government didnt do this, then in that case I will give you some money!", "image": null}

If I have $100 Million of energy and I buy a $1 Million insurance policy that pays off $100 Millionif it pays off! Well thats cheap! And I get to take the $99 Million and buy something else with it, but Ive assumed risk  Ive taken on counterparty risk in order to get the insurance policy.

So theres rules theyre all abiding by  or protocols  but whoever gets to make exceptions to those rules or protocols really has the power to act as they see fit in the world because they get to bend the rules! And thats what is so deeply profound about Bitcoin is that it is a set of rules that we cannot break! It is an exception-proof money supply! And its unlike anything weve ever had! And by eliminating that attack vector such that any group could be sovereign over the money, it effectively makes everyone individually maximally sovereign! And thats one of the great breakthroughs of Bitcoin!", "image": null}

If you look at the corruption and the decimation, the destruction, in our society, and the devastation in our economy, there are two things that everyone fears: individual bankruptcy and corporate insolvency. Becoming insolvent as an individual or as an entity. How many times have you heard the story, That was a really good company, but they took on too much debt and they couldnt make their interest and they were broken up and they closed the factories and they moved away and now were eat manufactured slop from a machine because our favorite vendor got destroyed. There are a lot of companies that get destroyed. How does it happen? Well they have treasuries in fiat, the fiats inflating, so the CFO thinks, Well I cannot afford to invest this! Its not politically acceptable to invest in stocks or equity that keeps up with inflation. If I invest in bonds, I cant keep up with inflation, and so I start buying my stock back, and I borrow money to buy my stock back. So if I have $100 Million in treasury and I borrow $100 Million and then I buy back $150 Million worth of stock, I get the stock up, but now my treasury is -$50 Million in net treasury instead of +$100 Million, right? So I went from having a positive positionits like you have enough fat to live for 30 days without food, to a negative position  you have no fat, youre in debt, and theres a banker that clicks on a Feed You button every day, and if the banker decides to pull the plug on your credit line, youre instantly eviscerated! And so a company in debt with no liquid assets has no energy! Its in energy debt! So what that means is, Maybe you generate $100 Million in cash flow a year and youve got $500 Million or $1 Billion in debt and you need $90 Million as EBITDA to cover the covenants. That means you have a $10 Million cushion! That means you have a $2 Million a quarter cushion! That means that in any given quarter, if you were short $3 Million on a $500 Million number, that $3 Million kicks you into default on your debt and renders you potentially  it renders your capital worthless! It can drive your equity to zero! And it can render you insolvent, you lose your sovereignty and the creditor can take control of your company  you lose everything! Its the same as: I go onto an exchange and Im trading at 50:1 or 100:1 leverage. The idea that Im going to pledge 1 Bitcoin and get control of 100 Bitcoin, and if it goes down by 100 bucks Im going to be utterly wiped out is a pretty silly idea! I would not recommend it to anybody other than an addicted gambler! If your goal is, Im okay losing all of thisand thats just like going to Vegas or going to Bitcoinville  if thats what you want to do, then call it a gambling habit! But theres nothing rational about it! The leverage could be thought of as every entity  be it a government or a corporation  is draining their life energy, pouring it out, when you flip from having a positive treasury to a negative treasury. I have drained my entity of my life force, and Im living at the pleasure of my creditors or my counterparties, wherever and whoever they may be! Ive lost my sovereignty!", "image": null}

Because the real debt load is actually eroding via inflation over time, so theres an incentive to take on debt. But this is a very short-sighted strategy, because now you are hyper-exposed to the inherent volatility of the future! So once theres any form of shockCOVID or any other form of economic shock  you can go to zero immediately! You get wiped out! Versus holding cash  makes you antifragile! You can absorb these shocks!

And the cash will actually be worth more over time! And thats what Jeff Booth points out. But every technologist knows this! If there was no inflation, the cash would buy more over time, and my entire simple monetary strategy would be: save cash and over time Ill improve. But in a currency war, the political system declares war on the currency and makes the cash toxic! And if its 2% toxic, thats like injecting a mild drug into your veins. When it becomes 10% toxic, its like a poison in your veins. When it becomes 20% toxic, this is like basically saying Im gonna put a healthy on chemotherapy, and I pump toxic chemicals through a healthy persons bloodstream, because current  current is like blood current  its carrying the energy of life, the oxygen. Oxygen is energy. Your blood carries energy to keep you alive  currency is carrying energy! If a sovereign nation is injecting massive inflation into its own currency, its injecting a toxicity into its own circulatory system, and its somewhere between either  one metaphor is chemotherapy  another metaphor would be Type 2 Diabetes. Im injecting so much sugar into your system that your insulin response is failing and youre becoming insulin-resistant, and your body becomes diabetic and I give you metabolic disease because I am just pumping the liquidity too hard into the currency, which is the blood of life!", "image": null}

Toxic shock! The toxic shock of the system. But, lets move back to our happy subject! How does the Bitcoin energy network grow? Well, adoption! So a million people adopt it as their 90% treasury reserve asset and they have $1 Million each, and now youve got $1 Million times a thousand is a billion, a million times a million is a trillion, right? So a million millions gets you to a trillion in the network, they put the money in the network and the network is the syndication of all of the treasury energy of the people that choose to adopt it as their primary treasury reserve. So when a million people put a million dollars in its a trillion dollar network. When a thousand companies put a billion dollars in, its another trillion dollar network, so now youre up to $2 Trillion! When a hundred companies put a billion in or $100 Billion in  you go the next level! So as individuals, families, private companies, public companies, government agencies, small governments, municipalities, states, small countries, mid-size countries, big countries, all the non-profit organizations  as they adopt this as their treasury reserve asset, they dont need to adopt it as their currency, medium of exchange! They dont need to adopt it as their unit of measure! As it becomes their store of value, their treasury reserve asset, as they adopt it, the network syndicates all their energy, and the decision of Apple to buy $100 Billion worth of it would accrue to the benefit of a million HODLers that bought $100,000 each or $1 Million each or $50,000 or whatever they bought! The beauty of it is that everybody is pro rata, pari passu benefiting. And its in everybodys interest to bring everybody else in, right? And its a network effect, that as someone comes in, someone else comes in, the price moves up, the people that were in it get a benefit, and now we get to this next dynamic  with me pausing to say: without adoption, without people believing that this should be their treasury reserve asset, without that, you have nothing! So its not enough to say its just hard! People have to love Bitcoin more than they love gold, silver, Apple stock, Amazon, Facebook  whatever! By the way, we didnt touch on it much, but if we consider Bitcoin as an energy network versus Facebook or Apple as an energy network, the issue there is: I gotta look out 100 years and say, Will I be able to put $100 Million in Apple stock, hold it for 100 years  and whats my exposure? And of course your exposure is: income tax on the company, sales tax on their product, tariff exchanges, regulatory interaction, income tax on their employees, all sorts of other taxes you can come up with, plus many other regulatory actions including and likely being the ultimate regulation of these things as public utilities, because if they werent regulated as public utilities, the richest guy in every city would be the guy that owns the electrical power plant! And that guy would be richer than Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or anything! The only reason that these guys are rich is because theyre in a new novel unregulated area that was not deemed to be important! And the problem is, as soon as it is deemed to be important enough that you cant live without it, then it becomes a God-given right to have access to your YouTube or to your iPhone or to your whatever, and now the entire value proposition differs! I mean we live in a society right now where people think equity is the perfect store of value! What they dont realize is: its possible for the equity to go to zero! For example, a nationalized power station has zero equity! It still works! When stuff gets nationalized, be it education, power, electricity, technology  the equity goes to zero! You can have something with an equity zero and the debt has value. You can have something where the equity has no value, the debt has no value, but the underlying vendors are getting paid. It can shift back and forth  its a political thing! So with regard to Bitcoin and the value of the network, it comes down to people making the commitment to adopt it as their treasury reserve asset at all levels. Its just as good for us if Norway adopts it for their treasury reserve as it is some big charity as it is the Rockefeller Foundation or the Hughes Institute or Harvard or Stanford or MIT or for a private company or a public company or an agency of the government. Maybe the county or a city that you live in or the fire department or a union or a pension fund! And then theres all the investors, right? Hedge funds, pensions funds, insurance companies! There are a lot of entities that have monetary energy. They either need it to operate or they stored it up in trust for their shareholders or for future generations, etc. So as that energy flows, the network strengthens! Now thats the first order dynamic. Its simple network effect. Were syndicating our power. No different than  lets say that there are a hundred of us in a football field, and you organize 50 people to be on your tug-of-war team, and I can only get 5 on mine, and the rest are all singletons  your team wins! If theres a lesson of history, the lesson of history is: the most organized team always wins! Usually the Romans kicked everybodys ass for nearly a thousand years! Because they were the most organized! When they put their petty differences aside for 700 years, they beat everybody else. And then when they started fighting with each other theres the decay and eventually when they were disorganized, that disorganization causes a deterioration in power. So its the most organized that wins. It doesnt matter if youre in 8th grade football or whether youre in high school or in college. Whatever it is! Organization is always critical!", "image": null}

And also debunking what I would call the alternative narrative that money needs to be adopted as a medium of exchange to proliferate as a network. You do have to HODL or adopt it as a treasury reserve assetin an economic sense  to create reservation demand for that asset. Youre taking that asset off the market. Youre reducing its supply, thereby increasing its price. And thats what creates the bootstrapping effect, this monetization process. And that again hearkens back to this evolutionary path where you have it as a store of value first. After its created enough value, it can be used as a medium of exchange, because those early HODLers had more of an incentive to use it as a medium of exchange. And then finally when its been widely accepted enough, its being used as a unit of account. To your point about organization, HODLers are all perfectly aligned to 21 Million! Its just the energy efficient strategy is to just HODL! Its very simple, hard to disrupt, hard to disorganize because theres not a lot of activity on the part of the HODLer, so it seems like an indomitable strategy in the market for money!", "image": null}

The people that are trading in it dont really understand it, because if they understood it they would just buy it and HODL it! And sometimes people think theyre accomplishing something, but theyre accomplishing not that much! If a hundred entities buy $1 Billion each, then the value of the networks gonna go up by more than $100 Billion, and if they just buy it and park it in a cyber-vault and dont touch it for 100 years, it doesnt matter! Its going up! The fact that they poured their energy into the container is actually what caused the energy network to grow! The moving in and out is actually wasting and dissipating energy! Youre just dissipating energy to come and go, and ultimately the success of the thing  I hear these people, they talk about store of value, medium of exchange. Well, Bitcoin is the high frequency store of value and a low frequency medium of exchange! Thats what it needs to be and technically thats what it is! And if you understand that, once you get it, you realize you shouldnt fight that! So for example: I buy $1 Billion of Bitcoin. Every second, it keeps anybody from stealing my Bitcoin! Every second, its storing the value! No government, no parasite, no thief, no hacker is taking my billion dollars every second for the next million years! Its working! In the same way that I put that energy into a vacuum package and every second its staying vacuum sealed, and the whole point was to live forever! And so if I gave you a little crypto-field that made you live forever and never age, you would say, High frequency longevity device  it works pretty well! And you wouldnt have a problem  theres nothing wrong with living forever! Its immortal energy! So thats high frequency. The problem is, people dont recognize that every second of the day theyre being attacked. You are being attacked! Every second of the day theres bacteria and theres viruses trying to kill you! If I said, Im gonna spin up a field that stops them from killing you, its gonna work a million years, and youre not gonna notice it  you would think thats a pretty good trick! But that is in fact what happens when you actually store value! Now, low frequency medium of exchange: in order for Bitcoin to have its antifragile properties and utility, we have to be able to move it on occasion. Maybe once a year I move it from one cyber crypto bank to another one, or one cyber vault to another one, or once a decade. Or maybe when Im gonna die I need to transfer it to somebody or split it between my daughter and my son. Or maybe not, maybe I just have one key and I give it to my one child. They give it to their one child, they give it to their one child  then it never gets transferred! Maybe once a year I have to take 5% of my Bitcoin out of my vault, convert it to fiat, and then break that into 100,000 little parts and put it on Apple Pay and use it to pay for Ubers and Dominos Pizza and credit card bills. Okay! Once a year I take a chunk out of my piggy bank, my crypto bank, and I put it into fiat, and I do whatever Im gonna do with it  maybe! And maybeif the world works the way youd think it might workI just put $100 Million into the vault, I never take it out, I just borrow against it! I just borrow $3 Million a year, $1 Million a year  tax free! I dont recognize income, I dont generate a capital gain tax, I dont generate an operating income tax. If I borrow money in cash and if my Bitcoin is going up 20% a year  thats the real yieldand I can borrow money at 5%, then my effective arbitrage is 15%! So it never makes sense to sell it, ever! In fact, if you look at people that use real estate as a store of value, the way it works is, My family buys a block in Manhattan for $10 Million in 1900. It goes up 8% a yearit doubles every 10 years. Its worth $20 Million, then $40 Million, then $80 Million, and then $160 Million, and by the time you get out 80 years, you got a billion dollars worth of real estate in Manhattan. Youre not selling it! You havent done one transaction in a hundred years! All youve done is pledged it as collateral against the loan and youve borrowed $42 Million against it and youre paying 3% interest. And that $42 Million  thats not income! You didnt pay 42% tax on $42 Million  thats not income! Thats not a capital gain! Its not a long term capital gain! Its not a short term capital gain! Its a liability! Youve generated $42 Million of liabilities against a non-taxed asset. The only way its getting taxed is youre just suffering from real estate taxes, right? But, if youre in a jurisdiction where inflation is high, real estate tax is low, interest is low, then your secret to living well forever tax-free is just borrow against your stationary assets! And so thats the news of this week: Donald Trump has $400 Million in debt and paid no taxes for a decade. But hes not unique! You could substitute every real estate magnate, a family that had generational wealth in real estate, they all did it! All of em! How do rich people live well and pay no taxes? Not by selling stuff! Not by transacting stuff! The way that they actually live is they just park an asset on the balance sheet, and they never ever ever ever trade it! They just finance it or borrow against it  and once in a blue moon, once in a decade, somebody wants to pay me triple what its worth  and maybe I do it, but oftentimes, the Warren Buffett school of thought is, The taxes kill you! And so the ideal holding period for an asset is forever! He says its forever like Im committed to it  yeah! But its the taxes that murder you, and so the ideal holding period is forever because then you can pledge it and borrow against it. How do you get rich? You buy an asset, it goes up, you borrow against it to buy another asset, and it goes up, you borrow against it, you buy another asset, and it goes up, and pretty soon youve generated all these assets that are highly appreciated with massive built-in capital gains that youre never ever gonna recognize! Obviously that can change in different types of jurisdictions where politicians decide theyre just gonna tax you on unrealized capital gains, but ", "image": null}

Is it just kind of a threshold that you would never borrow more than say 10% of the value of the collateral  something to that effect? Is that how you protect yourself?", "image": null}
{"title": "The Saylor Series | Episode 5 | Channeling Monetary Energy Across Time and Space", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-saylor-series-episode-5-channeling-monetary-energy-across-time-and-space-92f68a8327ea?source=user_profile---------19-------------------------------", "body": "Michael Saylor: The fragility comes from two primary metrics: collateral coverage and the mark to market frequency of the loan  the duration of the loan. How frequently is the collateral marked to market? So for example, if you borrow money to buy a house and its a 30-year mortgage and if the bank says to you, theyre never gonna mark it down. Right? Theres some loans like a mortgage loan where theyll never get marked down. They might get marked up  you can go to the bank and you can petition them to revalue your loan but nobody ever went to the bank and said, Mark my house to the market after the real estate market crashed! So if you buy a $1 Million house with an $800,000 loan, and you got $800,000 in debt and its never marked to market then theres not that much fragility as long as you can make the $25,000 a year interest payment, assuming 3%, right? So thats not that risky  I mean a little bit risky, you cant make $25,000 and you lose it  but on the margin, if I didnt have the million bucks or I didnt have the $800,000 and somebody was willing to give me the $800,000 house for free, and all I did was pay $25,000 a year  I think thats a pretty good trade off! The worst that happens is they take the house back and I go do it again somewhere else. So thats not very fragile! How does it get fragile? It gets fragile when you buy a $1 Million worth of stock on a $800,000 loan and youve got loan-to-value of 80%. And now, the stock trades down 20%! And the stock trades down 20% and the banker marks the collateral every day. And if youre in a swap with the bank, they will mark it to market every day. Every single day, they calculate the value of collateral, and if youre under you have to wire them the money the next day! And if youre over, they in theory have to wire you the money! And you have to mark it to market every day  thats risky! So if you were gonna buy $100 stock, you probably dont want to borrow more than 50%, but if you borrow 50% you damn well better think that the volatilitys not gonna be 50%! You cant afford to! So probably in that case, if you thought the volatility was that it could lose half its value, youd want to borrow no more than 25%! And if you wanted to hold the stock even if it loses 80% of the value you cant borrow more than 20% loan-to-value, right? So the big risk, the hyper-risk is one of these Bitcoin exchanges that go 100:1 in leverage and I mark to market every hour! What if I mark to market every minute, Robert? I mean that the BitMex liquidation! I basically bought 100 Bitcoin, I pledge 1 Bitcoin, it gets marked to market every minute, and if the price goes down $100 I get wiped out and theres a crash! And it happens in 3 seconds. So thats risky. If you want to take the opposite point of view, I have 100 Bitcoin and Im gonna borrow the equivalent of 1 Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin in value, and as long as it doesnt go more than 90% down, Im good. But if you wanted to save for one, you would say, Im gonna borrow against the collateral but I want you to agree that you wont ever mark it to market  thats what real estate loans are! Or a bank: Im gonna loan you money against your artwork or against your boat or against some other interesting collectible, and every year or every 5 years our appraiser is gonna reappraise it. So the issue is the frequency of the appraisal, combined with the volatility of the asset combined with the political regime youre in combined with the loan-to-value! If youre in a political regime where its unacceptable to let real estate values go down, then you can reasonably expect that its not likely your house is gonna be worth 20% of what you bought it for because the politicians wont let that happen! But they might not protect your Picasso painting! So if I borrowed money against a Picasso painting and the banker said were gonna mark it to market every month, thats not as good as once a decade! So when youre thinking about risk, youre thinking about, How liquid is the collateral? And how frequent is the mark to market? And then how much is the loan-to-value? And thats how you get to a question of risk and what you should do and not do! Im not saying you have to do it, by the way! You could just sell the Bitcoin highly appreciated for cash, pay the tax, and take zero risk! And look, if the interest rate was 18% and you thought that the economy was gonna grow at 34%, then you would sell and you wouldnt take on the debt! So its a function of interest rates as well, and productivity. Lets go back to this issue of our power equation: adoption, utility, productivity, inflation. We talked about adoption, and my point there was youre just syndicating  if the world was static, in a static world where theres $1 Trillion of assets, if you get $100 Billion on the network then thats better than $10 Billion! And $500 Billion is better than $100 Billion! And in a static world its just all about recruiting and getting people to join the network. But the world is not strictly speaking static! The next thing is dynamic, and technology is what makes it dynamic! And thats where utility comes in! So if I can take Bitcoin and I can buy it from Square Cash, its got more utility! If I can send it as $22  if I can send it from Square Cash  if Square will convert my Bitcoin into dollars and send it in a split second, its got more utility! If Apple Computer builds it into Apple Pay, and I can link a small wallet with 1% of my Bitcoin into Apple Pay and I can zap that around on my iPhone, its got more utility! If Kraken creates a crypto bank and they offered me 4% interest and theyll offer it to me with institutional low-risk counterparty and they represent to me that theyve got $100 Billion of insurance and I can give them my crypto wallet and I get 4% interest on it or 6% and I trust them, the utility just went up again, and Bitcoin becomes more valuable! If I get to the point where I can manage my crypto keys using my retina scanner face ID and give speech instructions and I can say, Send Robert $37 of my crypto in cash  and if it always works and I just did it and its more secure than a hardware key and I dont have to remember my 12 [word] seed key or whatever and it never fails  utility went up! Right? If I can say, Robert  maybe Ive got a girlfriend, Lisa I could say, Send Lisa flowers on her birthday every year for the next decade  click! And its jacked into my cryptoutility went up! Theres a lot of ways utility can go up. Buying stuff, selling stuff, etc. Its all a function of technology. If the Lightning Network works. In the ideal world, back to my example, I have X money  $10 Million  I have $100,000 in my checking account. I say, Move $100,000 in checking, leave the rest in the bank yielding 7% interest  tie my checking account into Apple Pay, link that to my Uber account, my sisters Uber account, my Dominos account, and use it to pay off Netflix, Google, this, that, and the other thing, and pledge it as trusted collateral on some dating network to show that Im a real person, and then use it to automatically pay all my fees on my domain registrations every year when they become due. There I just set it! I just did it  thats utility! Thats [what were looking for! 1:06:09]", "image": null}

Well we have a million HODLers and they put $1 Million each into the network and now we have $1 Trillion in the network. Adopting it as your primary treasury reserve assets means sweeping your excess cash flows into Bitcoin, so those million people put $1 Million each, but how much money do they make each year, and how much do they save each year? So lets say they make $100,000 a year, and they save $10,000 a year. So $10,000 times a million  $10 Billion! So in that case $10 Billion in fiat gets converted into Bitcoin every year! Thats the productivity! If they all get a raise  next year itll be $11 Billion. The next year itll be $12 Billion. If they all start their own business, the near year itll be $30 Billion. If the economys growing and theyre inventing cool stuff and one of them becomes the next Michael Dell or Bill Gates or whatever, that persons gonna put in $100 Billion or $50 Billion! If you get lucky and one of your HODLers is Jeff Bezos hes gonna put in $37 Billion! So the productivity of the individuals is going to sweep cash flows into the network. And the same is true with the productivity of the corporations! So Microstrategy, we put $500 Million into a network, we make $50 Million a year. If we generate $50 Million a year after tax, we sweep that into the treasury, right? And do that 10 years in a row, our initial $500 Million is going to become $500 Million more of discounted cash flow! So now were just back to some basic finance theory: Whats the value of the stock? Its equal to the balance sheet cash value plus the discounting of the cash flows. The discounted value of the cash flows over time! So, the treasury that gets put in is the initial slug, and the discounted value of the cash flows of all the people in the network is the next value proposition. Of course, this kind of dovetails nicely with economic theory, because if the overall worldwide economy is flat and not growing, then the cash flows are not gonna grow! If the overall economy tanks and starts to deteriorate, the cash flows will deteriorate! If I destroy the economy, cash flows are going to zero, no value will accrete! And if I invent an atomic overthruster that gives you infinite energy in a sugar cube, presumably productivity is gonna go through the roof and cash flows are gonna go through the roof! So ultimately were getting a bunch of people to join the network and then all of our fates are intertwined with all of our productivities! Weve created a cyber economy! Just like Warren Buffett said, Never bet against the United States. The United States was a 20th century physical economy and every business in it was working to the benefit of every other business in a competitive capitalist Darwinian ecosystem. Well now were actually creating a cyber economy where you can be in a relationship with anybody else to the extent that, Robert, you adopt as a HODLer and I adopt as a corporate treasurer! If Im successful, you benefit! If youre successful, I benefit! Obviously, if we can get Apple Computer to put $100 Billion in and then sweep $50 Billion a year, we all benefit! And when a country does it, they benefit. And of course, if the people that join the network are more responsible, if they actually are productive and they save more than they spend, or they earn more in revenue than they spend in cost, then the network grows. And if they spend more on revenue, flip it the other way  a million HODLers all of a sudden save their money and then they start going crazy and partying and quit their jobs and buy Lambos and blow it all on champagne and gambling, they start drawing down their balances in the Bitcoin network and they sell their Bitcoin for fiat! And if theyre selling it for fiat theyre draining it out of the network! So the network is going to accrete with virtuous economic behavior and debase and dilute with vices!", "image": null}

Because it was indeed a place in the world with the lowest impediments to free trade that actually led to America creating the most wealth and the most capital. And in many ways I think Bitcoin positively embodies a lot of the founding principles of American free market capitalism. You have inviolable property rights in Bitcoin, which in the American ecosystem actually marginally disrespected through Quantitative Easing and fiat currency printing. Theres a rule of law here in the US, so we have non-violent dispute resolution and enforcement of contract law, and clearly the Bitcoin network is the most adept network at reaching global consensus weve ever created! And then kind of from the first view, honest money or hard money would be something else that a real capitalist system puts out. So its almost as if America as an experiment was the closest thing to pure capitalism we had prior to Bitcoin.

The insulation is the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean! 3,000 miles of water  you have to go through the army, the navy, and the air force, and that protected a bunch of capitalists, a bunch of entrepreneurs.

Again, Trotskys point, You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you! Its kind of hard to go about your business when people are rolling over you with tanks this way and that way. And the equivalent of that in a monetary system or an energy system is with someone stealing your energy! Okay? How do I keep my coffee warm? I put it in a thermos! I need to insulate my energy so that no one steals it! If I take your Starbucks coffee and I put it in a cooler of ice and I drop it in the ice your coffees getting cold! And so the wall of encrypted energy is the insulator. The wall of water is the insulator. The insulator is the insulator. The vacuum is the insulator. If you want a crucible of virtuous innovation, you need that vessel that serves as the insulator against all the forces that would attack it from without or [within] from fear with this process. And that is Bitcoin, right? Were creating that! And having said all that, right: adoption, utility, productivity  those three things create that monetary chemical reaction of sorts. And the last piece is inflation. But inflation is almost just the way that we translate the energy  its a translation coefficient of the energy into a frame of reference of the dimensionality or the domain where Im spending it. I mean, Im gonna have to translate my monetary energy into Rubles or Pesos of Dollars or Euros of Yen if I cross into one of those domains, because its their world, not our world! So if the Dollar didnt inflate, then would Bitcoin go up? If the United States had a perfect monetary policy  no inflation  could Bitcoin succeed? Yeah! It could succeed! If people adopt it  because its got technical advantages, right? If they adopt it as a reserve asset, I mean their choice is that versus stock versus bonds versus property  you still have the issue of: How do I commute energy through time and space? So I would still adopt it! Technology will still get better! I mean if there was no inflation you would still like the iPhone. You would still like Zooming to me if there was no inflation! Technology would get better, and wed have productivity! Wed be inventing stuff: fusion, better materials, etc. And when we created stuff like Zooming and we put together Zoom with YouTube, we would talk, and someone would put it up on YouTube and 100,000 people would see it and 3 people would have an idea and something would happen that wouldnt have happened otherwise! You dont need inflation for Bitcoin to be successful anymore than you need it for Google or Apple or Amazon to be successful  it just happens that in an inflationary environment it accelerates  2% inflation will grow it 2% faster, 10% inflation will grow it 10% faster  in theory if a bond is pure energy and if bonds are inflating at 20%, then that means that Bitcoin will have a 20% real yield in that currency where you see that energy inflation! And itll be different relative to the frame of reference of every single domain or every country depending upon how they choose to manage their currency. They could in theory  I could peg the Dollar, like in Singapore or the UAE I peg to the Dollar. I could peg to gold. If I peg to gold, itll be a 34% differential. If I peg to the Dollar it could be a 1015% differential. If I peg to the Peso it could be a 32% differential. So all of the value of Bitcoin relative to the people in the ecosystems in the domain will vary! And of course, thats why if Im in Lebanon or Argentina, this is even more insanely valuable to me than if Im in Switzerland!", "image": null}

I would just maybe add that 2% inflation would increase adoption say by 2%, but as you increase the inflation rate, I think it would actually be non-linear, because if you take the extreme example of hyperinflation, everyone would pile out of their currency into the Dollar or into Bitcoin  something that was more reliable, such that, as you increase from say 2% to 10%, peoples inflation expectations actually increase, which gives them further incentive to move into Bitcoin or something alternative.", "image": null}

You cant create more of it! If I give this much to you, you cant wiggle your fingers and make it twice as much! If you lose it, its gone! And you can play all these games and thermodynamics  its a great field because everybody thinks  theyre all looking for that perpetual motion machine. The laws of thermodynamics, we used to paraphrase them at MIT in a snarky way, wed say, You cant win, you cant break even, and you cant get out of the game! The laws of thermodynamics! Its like, from a laymans point of view: You cant cheat! There is no cheating in thermodynamics! It might look like you got something for nothing  even Maxwells demon. He posed, Maybe I could actually fight or reverse entropy and get order from disorder by dividing a chamber and I have a demon and theres a little door and molecules are bouncing around, and what if my demon opened the door when the molecule bounced from the right to the left and closed it before the [molecule] bounced from the left to the right? I could over time with randomness get all of the bouncy molecules on one side of the chamber and I could reduce entropy. And they couldnt figure that out! They called it Maxwells demon. Well whats wrong with that argument? Doesnt that break the laws of thermodynamics? And the answer came along 100 years later when some IBM computer scientist pointed out that information is building up in the head of the demon, and the information is in and of itself creating entropy, and so no youre not cheating! Once you actually account for all the information, disorder, and energy in the system, it did respect the laws of thermodynamics! You cant cheat time. You cant cheat space. There is ultimately conservation! And Isaac Newton  all of Newtons laws: conservation of mass, conservation of energy F = ma, its the basis of physics, the basis of mechanics, the basis of every machine weve built that works, its the basis of all of our heat exchange, and it hasnt been I mean scientists and engineers dont have a high opinion of economists. And one of the reasons why is that it hasnt been important for economists to understand closed systems, isolated systems, servomechanisms, conservation of mass and energy, E = mc2. E = mc2 matters! What it means is: If theres mass, it becomes exponentially expensive to move it around. E is the energy! You wanna move stuff fast? You need to take the mass to zero! And thats how you move stuff fast! So economists, maybe what they were doing didnt matter before Bitcoin! You could say, maybe Bitcoin is the first time that technology crashed into economics! You have energy, you have technology, you have math crashing into economics and now you couldnt really be a competent economist without appreciating closed systems, energy efficiency, math, conservation of everything!", "image": null}

It perfectly respects and aligns itself with the laws of thermodynamics in the economic sphere! And another thing this made me think of was  this was a framework I got from you on inflation  was that, CPI is low, but everything you want is inflating rapidly. You could probably plot that on a spectrum as, The things that are more energy intensive to create are inflating more rapidly, and the things that are created easily are tweaked and controlled and dumped into that CPI bucket!", "image": null}

That was Episode 5 of the Saylor Series and, man! What a big episode! We hit on some major concepts today! I just thought it was super interesting, as always! Mr. Saylor brings the heat! I think first of all we talked about how fiat currency is basically implemented as a means of augmented the portability of gold, because gold is heavy and physical, its difficult and expensive to transact it across space, although gold is really good at holding its value across time and has a high relative scarcity. But the point there that Saylor brought up was, Although gold-backed paper currencies were great at moving value across space  that was their purpose of introduction  they actually suffer because they have all of these frictions between different regulatory and intermediary environments, such that when you try and move cash from say China to the US, you hit different types of capital controls and whatnot. So it can be very expensive and cumbersome to actually move fiat currency across different jurisdictional domains which actually inhibits its original purpose, which was to increase the portability of money! And I like the analogy he drew with a boat: If you consider that the moving value across space function of money is something like putting goods on a boat and selling it across the sea, hes saying effectively that gold was dingyvery unlikely to move value across space well, whereas fiat currency might be something more like a wooden ship  a little bit better at doing that but still not idea, whereas Bitcoin is actually like a steel ship  its an extremely strong protocol and as long as you maintain the steel by painting it its basically indestructible. The analogy there being: So long as Bitcoin is maintained by the mining network  which generates its revenue through the block revenue and the transaction fees  that essentially makes the monetary network itself self-reinforcing and indestructible in a lot of ways. And then the last analogy is that steel is super repairable! If you weld a steel plate onto the hull of a ship, the weld actually has a higher tensile strength than the original steel itself, which I think again analogizes [to] Bitcoin, is that: It can absorb superior competitive features from the marketplace, so it can actually repair or improve itself in a way that makes it even stronger than its original form. So that was a great analogy! And the other one that I liked that we touched on was the vacuum sealing of food, which if you think about it its just a way of restricting the stored energy  whether its food or money  from contact with entropy of the environment. In the case of vacuum sealing, were removing all of the air  all of the microorganisms that might exist in that air, water, or moisture  from the package itself, such that none of them can attack the energy content stored therein. And the analogy there being: Getting the entropy or uncertainty out of the monetary channel. We can think of the SHA-256 algorithm as an encrypted vacuum sealing of the monetary energy stored in the Bitcoin network. So it gives it this super-high resistance to impurities or uncertainty or nefarious actors  it doesnt even have to be nefarious necessarily depending on your perspective on central banksbut it gets the uncertainty out of your money! So it gives it this energetic vacuum seal, so I thought that was a really cool analogy too. [1:34:38] And we talked about money being power. And that money itself is this superset of all power that humans have been able to create in the world. Again the physics definition for power which I really liked  because it ties back to the importance of proof of work  power is the capacity to do work over time. So to be able to apply force over distance over time  thats what power actually means. It makes sense that we would generate power, or be able to allocate energy into a power storage network through proof of work. Thats what gold mining was, and thats what the mining expenditure related to Bitcoin is! So we think of money as this amalgam of all the powers that human beings have had over time and looking at Bitcoin through that lens, we see that the power of the network  which was another analogy that Saylor used was the voltage in a closed source system  so the supply of Bitcoin doesnt move, but the amount of energy stored in the network is the only thing that can be increased! So its a perfectly closed system that mass can neither exit or leave, but only energy can be added to it! In that way we can think of the power of the Bitcoin energy network as its price, effectively. We dug in a little bit in that and talked about stock to flow model and Bitcoin supply issuance. Its not actually the supply that is driving the value necessarily  as we go into later  its more a function of its utility. Because as Saylor said the impossibility to produce something is not what makes it valuable, its actually the impossibility of producing something that already has relevance to someones goal-directed action! So value is this subjective quality where if a particular object or even a service or a piece of knowledge is relevant to you accomplishing the aims of your goal-directed action  if its an accelerant for you towards you achieving your goals  then we can say that thing has value! Even if something is an accelerant towards you achieving your aims  say like oxygen, we all have the aim of breathing and surviving  it doesnt actually have a lot of value because it has no scarcity! So the scarcity can amplify the value, but the value itself is actually a function of the individual good, service, or knowledges relevance to your goal-directed action. So we actually put it in these buckets of what actually defines the monetary network value of Bitcoin. And he classified it as: adoption, inflation, utility, [and productivity]. And I loved this quote he used. He said that Bitcoin is, An encrypted energy crucible in which we store the energy of life. So we touched on it repeatedly in this show that money is life force. Its this meta-energy that allows us to access essentially any other form of energy thats available in the marketplace. [1:38:08] And in that way we need a system that maps onto the scarcity of the thing that it represents, if that makes sense. So in thermodynamics, energy can neither be created nor destroyed, so it makes sense that the money which best maps onto that will become naturally selected in the marketplace! And then we went into another definition of moneyand this is one Ive used several times. I say that, Money is an insurance policy on the uncertainty of the future. The ineradicable uncertainty of the future! No matter how much technology advances, were never going to get rid of uncertainty! Uncertainty itself by the way is another expression of entropy! We live in a universe pervaded by entropy, and in fact entropy is the only thing that defines the flow of time in the universe. Everything  often these processes are symmetric  but the one thing that imparts a directionality to time is this flow of entropy: things left unmaintained becoming increasingly uncertain or breaking down or more chaotic over time. So money, since it gives us pure optionality in the marketplace  its like, no matter what unforeseen consequence we encounter, money is the best tool for dealing with that uncertainty, because it gives us a claim on the collective savings of the world! So we can access whatever it is we may needassuming its available in the marketplaceto resolve that uncertainty when we encounter it. And Saylor made a good caveat to this analogy because he said that one thing about an insurance policy is that it carries a lot of counterparty risk. So even today were sitting in 2020 with this global pandemic striking, many insurance policies are not being paid out because it had exclusions for a pandemic or other force majeure I guess they call a lot of them. So we could say that Bitcoin is actually even more valuable than just a standard insurance policy in that its a non-counterparty insurance policy! Its a money that does not have any political exposure to pay out. So if youre holding cash in a form that cant be confiscated, inflated, stopped, then no matter what eventuality you encounter or what circumstances you encounter in dealing with the uncertainties of life, you have a pool of pure capital optionality with Bitcoin! And that cannot be said for any other asset! There is no other money that can provide you that degree of assurance! [1:40:53] I mentioned that quote from Carl Schmitt that, Sovereign is he that decides the exception, so this really important because by totally removing counterparty risk from money, Bitcoin has removed all exceptions from money or the monetary policy if you will. And by doing that, youve taken away the ability to make exceptions in the game of Bitcoin, so all of a suddenSovereign is he who can make the exception  if no one can make the exception, then no ones sovereign so theres no sovereign over participants in the network, which means youve maximized the individual sovereignty of all network participants! And this is something thats really radical! You really have to think about this for a long time! Again we could define sovereignty somewhat simply as just, The authority to act as one sees fit. The ability to conduct an action consistent with your purpose of aims. And Bitcoins the only money in history that maximizes our ability to do that! As I argue in one of my latest pieces, Bitcoin is Hope, that Bitcoin is money purpose-built for entrepreneurship. It maximizes not only their sovereignty but also their accountability, and their ability to engage in adventure! To engage in business dealings and taking on risk to try and solve problems for the market and generating value in the process. So I thought that was a really interesting way to look at it. And then we got into debt, and I love the way he described debt as almost an anti-energy, where youve actually, instead of having this capital cushion against uncertainty, that debt actually can amplify the negative consequences of encountering uncertainty! Now it can also be used to enhance the positive consequences! Thats what leverage is, thats what amplifies gains or losses, but it tends to be a poor strategy over time, because the one thing thats unavoidable in an entropic universe is volatility. It makes positive volatility more beneficial, but it can make negative volatility cause you total destruction. It puts you at risk of ruin, which if youve any of Talebs work, its just the number one thing we all must avoid! We got into some specific examples of how fiat currency  because its depreciating over time and large corporations have access to really cheap loans, its actually incentivizing them to take negative treasury positions! To borrow money on the market at low rate and buy back their own stock, because again you would expect that the scarcity of that stock and the performance of the underlying capital tend to outperform the borrowing cost in a market where the cost of borrowing is suppressed by central banks, effectively. [1:44:13] So this puts corporations in a weird position because the incentive structure is such that its causing them to fragilize their own business model into  instead of having a positive buffer against uncertainty in their treasury theyre actually carrying negative treasury balances  which can make them subject to their creditors! The wishes of their creditors, which again  Sovereign is he who makes the exceptions. All of a sudden, by marginalizing your own capital position and putting yourself in the hands of creditors youve now given away your sovereignty in the world to your creditor, and taken it away from yourself and your shareholders. So I thought that was brilliant as well! And then we went into the politics of currency, and this is another way to look at the importance of Bitcoin is that people for years have talked about getting the money out of politics. If we get the money out of politics that would make for a more fair equitable system, but Bitcoins gonna flip that on its head! If youre getting money out of politics, that would require legislating away human nature somehow which in a way thats not possible! What we would do instead with Bitcoin is just get the politics out of the money. All of a sudden we have a money that cant be manipulated or confiscated based on political will. And Saylors analogy here is that politics actually toxify the currency. And we could think of Quantitative Easing or monetary inflation is actually like putting a healthy individual on chemotherapy just to enrich the physician  the physician being the government! The physician is administering this medicine to the patient, but the patient  being the productive economy  doesnt actually need it! Quantitative Easing again is not infusing any new value into the economy, its just reallocating it away from those holding the fiat currency as a store of value to those holding assets that inflate: typically real estate, stock, reliably scarce assets. So the other part of that is that over time this analogy holds because like even sugar or drugs like maybe heroin or chemotherapy  it loses its efficacy over time! So the stimulative effects of fiat currency inflation actually diminish over time as well! And thats what were seeing today in 2020 is that central banks have pushed all the levers to the metal so to speak and theyre getting very little economic response as a result. And through that biological lens we can consider hyperinflation as being a form of socioeconomic organ failure or a toxic shock where all of a sudden these energy centersin the form of our institutions or economic networksthe life blood that flows through them in currency has been so diminished in terms of its informational energetic carrying capacity that the institutions start becoming unraveled! People can no longer interoperate between themselves and between these institutions. The trust that maintains the social cohesion is basically diluted along with the currency! I thought that was a great way to look at it as well. And then this  I just think this is just a wonderful argument  this next point  on how to just diffuse anyones counterpoint to Bitcoin! Assuming they have a relatively sophisticated understanding of a store of value functionand its just a very simple thought experiment: How do you store value effectively for 100 years into the future? How can I store value today in the most lossless way to transmit it 100 years into the future? So we could say, Alright, whats being used today as a store of value? FAANG stocks or other high-performing equities! Theyre being used today  why not those? So the problem with those is that clearly by owning an equity youre taking on industry, regulatory, and counterparty risk. Theres not really many equities you couldve invested in 100 years ago that would still hold their value today! Maybe none actuallyI could be wrong on that! But very very few, so youd have to be the stock picker of the century so to speak for that to work. So youd say, Ah well lets look at something like real estate! Real estate also suffers from all of those issues! It does have reliable scarcity but its an asset thats out in the open, it cant be hidden, in the event of a war or an escalation of property taxes or even just outright confiscation as in the US with Eminent Domain  your property could just be taken away completely! Even if it worked perfectly, say youre paying a low property tax rate of 2% a year, youre still getting cut in half every 35 years! So thats not a very effective way. So historically the most trust-minimized asset or trustless store of value was gold. But as we covered in the last episode, gold has 2% inflation per year. If youre trying to circumvent the counterparty risk related to it you need to move it every quarter or every few years. That can be another 25 basis points to 1% per year. So now even looking at gold as the hardest economic store of value historically, youre talking about getting cut in half every 2235 years, and over a 100-year period youre approaching a 90% loss of value. You could say fiat currencies  the US Dollar! The US Dollar is strong today, but I would argue that theres scarcely a worse choice than that! That is the wealth storage medium that least holds its value over time. I think your best case of holding a fiat currency for 100 years  at least the past 100 years, say in the US Dollar youre above 99% total loss of value  and thats if you pick the right currency and yours doesnt hyperinflate or is invaded by another country and deauthorized or whatever it may be. So youre somewhere between 99%-100% loss of total value in fiat currency. So what does that leave you with? It leaves you with Bitcoin! Theres only one store of value that is totally free of counterparty risk, has a fully diluted or a universally transparent and predictable supply schedule  so we all know the inflation, theres zero unexpected inflation  and it can be stored in any number of ways in these custom, ultra high security custody schemas like multisig and things of that sort! So I think if you just zoom out on the store of value argument, its a clear winner! Theres just not even competition! I mean your second best choice is maybe I guess gold or possibly real estate, and youre still looking at  say in the case of real estate, if everything went perfectly and you only had your 2% property tax per year, youre looking at an 87% total loss in 100 years! Whereas Bitcoin you have essentially 0%! Its not that Bitcoin doesnt have inflation in the system, but the inflation is a fully-diluted cap table if you will. Everybody knows what it is! So youre playing off of 21 Million even though only 18.5 Million Bitcoin have been issued so far to date. So I thought that was brilliant! A great way to look at it. Zoom out! In the store of value area, Bitcoin is  undisputed  the best contender! I mean the one argument against it would be that its new! Its only 12 years old, so how could argue that its gonna last for 100 years  and that just comes down to faith and the existing track record of Bitcoin and the protocol and the math defending it. So its not a surefire bet, but assuming Bitcoin continues to function in the same flawless way it has to date then its not even a contest! Bitcoin is far and away the best store of value! [1:52:55] So that goes into a discussion about history, and Saylor made the point that the greatest lesson of history was that the most organized group of people win. Clearly, right? We are more than the sum of our parts when we can coordinate our efforts! And again, by getting the politics out of money, Bitcoiners are essentially perfectly aligned! We can compete and fight amongst ourselves and argue and all of these things, but the one thing that doesnt change, thats not subject to politics, is 21 Million, no confiscating, only private keys can generate and spend transactions  these fundamental rules of money that are not subject to politics enhances the cohesion of Bitcoiners, effectively. And so thats another perspective on why Bitcoin wins! Its just gonna have a more organized, more disciplined human force behind it! And the way it  I Tweeted this the other day  and this gets back to the Sun Tzu thing, Territory is the most decisive factor in determining the outcome of any battle. And as Bitcoiners, the moral, intellectual, and philosophical high ground that we occupy is virtually unassailable! So in my mind thats why we win! We are operating from a place that is the most protected and gives us the most optionality against all competing systems, and therefore that causes Bitcoin to outcompete all of the other systems over time! Thats just Darwinian. And then going back into the SOV store of value versus medium of exchange argument, Saylor had a brilliant way of describing this, that, Bitcoins a high-frequency store of value and a low-frequency medium of exchange! So that every second youre holding Bitcoin, its performing its function! Anyone thats saying Bitcoin doesnt have utility, they dont understand inflation. They dont understand store of value. Because every second youre holding Bitcoin and its adhering to that fixed and diminishing supply schedule and youre storing it in a custody model thats really difficult to confiscate or to corrupt, its performing its function! Its storing your monetary life energy in an encrypted vacuum sealed container! And one of the things he said there was, In the sphere of money, Bitcoin is immortal energy! Weve never had anything like this! And this too got into how preserving this wealth will impact Bitcoins relationship with fiat currency. So Bitcoin  which is historically yielding about 200% annually  if you can go out into the market and borrow at 5%, you have an incentive to never sell! You have an incentive to just keep accumulating Bitcoin and borrowing up to these intelligent thresholds, of ideally never being marked to market, and having favorable loan covenants. The incentive is to borrow, and acquire Bitcoin! Again he analogized this to how generational wealth is handled, where a lot of families just own, say, a block of New York City, and they just borrow against it little by little over time. So Saylors point is, In the sphere of money, Bitcoin operates as this immortal energy. And the incentives related to Bitcoin are interesting because historically its been yielding say 200% annualized return, so if you can go into the marketplace and borrow lets say 5% or anything below the annualized return, then you actually have an incentive to do so! To actually go out and borrow and acquire more Bitcoin! And more recently  this was recorded before Saylors latest announcement most recently he actually used Microstrategys balance sheet to go out and raise some convertible notes and do this very thing! Where he can borrow at a rate below Bitcoins expected annualized return, and hes using it to acquire additional Bitcoin! And this points toward something really interesting: Pierre Rochard wrote a great piece about this years ago. I think its called Speculative Attacks. And so whats effectively happening is that, since Bitcoin tends to outperform broader investment indices, and since debt and interest rates are being artificially suppressed by central banks, this opens up an attack vector on the fiat currency itself where market activists can go out into the marketplace, borrow fiat, and then actually sell that fiat to acquire Bitcoin! And if you do this at scale, this can actually induce inflationary pressure on the fiat currency undergoing the speculative attack. So this is to say: Saylors recent move with the convertible note play is in some ways a speculative attack on the US Dollar! So again it just points towards how the economic principles underpinning money and the incentive schemes related to both fiat currency and Bitcoin sort of all point towards the ultimate success of Bitcoin in the long term! Then we got into the utility of money. It was another one of these factors that drive Bitcoins success. And the general point here is pretty straightforward. Its: Bitcoin is extensible. Meaning, its protocol is adaptable. You can add other features to it, you can build businesses on top of it, you can connect APIs to it. Theres a great degree of programmability that Bitcoin enables that something like gold just does not! Gold is this dumb rock that essentially just sits in a vault and provides assurances of supply scarcity, but offers none of the feature sets that Bitcoin enables! And looking at it as technology, we can also say of fiat currency, it suffers because it has these technology backdoors in the form of issuers being able to inflate the supply and steal wealth from everyone else. Whereas something like gold or Bitcoin does not! It has these backdoors closed! And this spins up a number of interesting possibilities with Bitcoin which Saylor went into in a little more detail, but basically, by interfacing this base monetary protocol that we call Bitcoin with digital technology, we now gain a huge degree of customizability and unique ways to channel our will or intent across time and fund it in many unique ways. And you can do this with things like smart contracts that actually mitigate or minimize counterparty risk. Whereas if again you wanted to send flowers to your niece on her birthday every year for 100 years after your death, to do that with something like gold youd have to put all your trust in a custodian and some type of payment mechanism to get to the flower delivery guy, and then the flower delivery business itself youd have to bet on one that was gonna stay in business! Whereas with something like Bitcoin you can actually write a lot of these things into the code or into the smart contract that can go into the marketplace and search for say a good payment service to deliver the payment, a good flower delivery service. So it gives you a much higher degree of adaptivity and resiliency and projecting your will and intentions beyond the grave if you will, so super interesting way to look at Bitcoin. And then he touched on another aspect of Bitcoin that really drives its valuation, and he was referring to the productivity of the Bitcoin network participants themselves. So when market actors  whether theyre individual, corporate, or government  have decided to go long Bitcoin, theyre making a similar decision to what Saylor did, where theyre deciding to use Bitcoin as a primary treasury reserve asset, or said differently, just to hold it on balance sheet as a means of storing wealth. And what this does is that this is a two-phased approach because the initial phase is, Hey, Im putting my treasury into Bitcoin. Im selling the cash and buying Bitcoin. But the second-order effect of that is, once youve made that decision, you as a productive and effective entrepreneur are going to continue sweeping profits or excess cash flow into your treasury over time! So not only is the value accreted to the Bitcoin network  its not even that initial slug of capital in the form of the treasury transaction  but also the discounted future expected cash flows from future sweeps into that same treasury! And I think this is an incredibly way of looking at it, because Ive never seen anyone in Bitcoin that studies it closely that becomes bullish  that ever becomes less bullish! So its almost like once youre allocating capital in and youre studying it more closely and you see all of these things weve covered in depth and more things we will cover on how significant of a monetary innovation this really is, and it just causes you to escalate your allocation into your treasury. Maybe 20% of your treasury initially and creeping up to 30, 40, 50%! And this is all just a self-reinforcing feedback loop, because every decision you make to increase your allocation of Bitcoin is putting game theoretic pressure on all other market participants to do the same! Its a game of frontrunning or taking as much territory on the network as possible! So this has a really interesting effect of intertwining the fate of Bitcoiners together in a way that  its like a compounding incentive structure that incentivizes us not only to become more productive to generate even more free cash flow to put into this superior savings technology, but it also incentivizes us as HODLers to want to educate others! We want to describe to the rest of the world  not only for financial purposes but also for moral purposes  how the existing system is rigged! And you are being robbed! And this is not only pragmatically the best system but also philosophically the best system for savings the worlds ever had! And even evangelize! Once youre a Bitcoin HODLer and youve found this way of saving your own wealth  your own life energy  in an uncompromisable medium across time, you want the same for others! The natural human proclivity towards helping one another I think comes to the surface in that you want others to succeed in the same way because why would you want anything else? Actuallyother people succeeding in true free market economic competition  its a positive sum game! Every time someones doing something better, faster, cheaper, that solution theyre providing accretes to all of us! So Bitcoin reallynot only does it intertwine all of the fates of its network or market participants, but its also encouraging all of us to think differently and communicate differently! Versus a fiat currency paradigm which is much more zero-summuch more rent seeking focused. So on this topic of Bitcoin as an American  in the idea sense  technology, Saylor had this great quote that, A crucible of virtuous innovation requires a vacuum insulation layer. Again, to preserve the wealth whether thats the productivity, the energy generated, the profits, the cash flows of any entity requires an insulating layer of some kind! Otherwise the entropy of nature  whether its the greed of man or the uncertainty of nature or the taxes of moving capital from one jurisdiction to another  they just eat up that wealth itself! So again were back to Bitcoin being the ultimate vacuum sealing of capital weve ever had! We got into inflation a bit and the one thing I really wanted to point out here is that contrary to what Bitcoin is  this virtuous feedback loop of incentives and game theory  fiat currency is actually the reverse! So not only is inflation theft  its eroding real wealth through fiat currency supply inflation, but theres also a psychological element to it as well! If inflation is growing, market actors are smart! They start to attempt to frontrun future inflation, so actually inflation expectations tend to outpace actual inflation in a nonlinear fashion! So inflations coming in at 2, 3, 4, 5%. If its growing, people expect it to continue growing and theyll actually start selling their fiat today in anticipation of further fiat currency inflation in the future. And if you sell fiat currency, youre inducing further inflationary pressure on it. Youre actually increasing the velocity of money itself. It becomes this game of hot potatoes  you dont want to hold the dollars. And this can add fuel to that vicious cycle that ultimately culminates in hyperinflation. Again thats just the precise opposite of Bitcoins quantitative hardening technology  its disinflating over time, causing it to appreciate! And finally we got into one of the topics I like to talk about a lot which I think is eternally mystifying  is this concept of truth! Saylor presented it in a way I never heard before in that he said, Conservative energy is truth. Meaning that: Whatever strategy or organism or organization best adheres to the first law of thermodynamics and optimizing its inflows and outflows of energy or money or anything else  thats how you succeed! You wanna maximize your cash inflows, minimize your cash outflows, for instance, to be a successful organization. In that context Bitcoin is the first conservative monetary network in history! We could say gold was one  it was the most conservative monetary network in history  but Bitcoins the first one that maps perfectly onto thermodynamics! As Saylor said sort of jokingly how they talked about thermodynamics at MIT in that, You cant win, you cant break even, and you cant escape the game  Bitcoin maps onto that really well! You cant manipulate 21 Million, you must incur transaction fees  so you cant really break even  and you cant ignore the game! You cant escape the game of Bitcoin! It just imposes its rules on everything! So that was it! I think it was a great episode! He concluded with saying that perhaps Bitcoin is actually the first instance of technology crashing into economics, so possibly itll cause a rewriting of history books, which Ive intuited it would! More so in the sphere of say capitalism versus socialism, but we may actually see economics become more focused on these physical principles of say energy and everything that we discussed today  thermodynamics and things like that. And actually the new book by Saifedean  hes writing a book called Principles of Economics, and it goes into energy! Which is not something that you typically see in economics textbooks, so he might be right at the cutting edge of something really important! That was Episode 5, I hope you can tell things are heating up at this point! We spent a lot of time building this foundation and now I think youre starting to see the fruits of that. Things are only going to get more interesting in future episodes. Thanks for listening, and well see you soon!", "image": null}

Welcome back to Episode 4 of the What is Money? Show! Were coming back today with part 4 of the Saylor Series! And this is the first part of Day 2! So Saylor and I spent 2 days recording, we did about 10.5 hours in total, so Episode 4 represents the first episode in Day 2. And if you havent seen episodes 13 yet I highly recommend you go and check those out! We built a lot of foundational material there that just gets referenced back to going forward, so I think its really important! In Episodes 13 we covered the Stone Ages, the Iron Ages, we went into the Dark Ages, we went forward into the Steel and the Industrial Age. And now, today, were getting into the good stuff! Bitcoin theory, the Digital Age, how money and economics is changing once again based on these new and radical innovations in the world today. So today were gonna learn about how Bitcoin is the first true digital monetary system in world history! Were also gonna get Saylors answer to that all-important question: What is money? And he has a really good answer I think youre gonna dig! And were gonna get into a bit of the economic principles underlying commodities and their use as money, and why commodities make a really bad form of money, actually. Saylor lays out a really good case for the commodity money kind of being a self-defeating endeavor. And then finally, were gonna start looking at Bitcoin as the ultimate means of wealth settlement and preservation. As Saylor refers to it  it is the first closed loop or closed source energy system weve ever had! So I dont want to spoil anything! This episodes really good! For me this when a lot of the light bulbs started to go off and started to have a lot of those little, mini epiphanies during our conversation, which you might see me having as we engage. So I hope you like this! Its a really good episode. See you again soon!", "image": null}

Weve tried others, they just didnt work! This is the first one thats perfected, thats functioning! Its the first one to cross $100 Billion in market cap and now its about $200 Billion in market cap. $200 Billion means $200 Billion of monetary energy, and if I look at all of the great digital networks  Apple, Google, Facebook  when they cross $100 Billion of monetary energy, then thats a legitimizing step! Generally when they get there, 95% or more of the investing community doesnt believe in them! Sometimes 99% doesnt believe in them! But theyre too big to fail  theyre fires that have been unleashed into the society, and theyre burning, and the effect is exothermal. What we have in each of these networks is: we have the collapse, a dematerialization of some product or service or virtue or some ineffable quality be it friendship or mobile devices or information. Its collapsing into a lower energy state. And as it collapses into a lower energy state, huge amounts of energy in the form of profit, cash flow, and value get given off! Apple can ship a better camera to a billion people overnight for a nickel! Facebook can improve the way that you communicate to your loved ones overnight for a nickel! And Google can package the Library of Alexandria in the palm of your hand and ship it to a billion people overnight for a nickel! And when you have these massive dematerializations of value and they get on a network with a network effect, its almost like  well you see a crystallizing structure where youve got an amorphous substance and as it crystallizes we go from steam to water to ice! Collapses, gives off energy. And what Bitcoin is, is its that first digital monetary network, digital monetary system. Its collapsing into a much more efficient form, its giving off energy! And that just brings us back to that entire subject of: how important is energy to the human race!", "image": null}

So its like all that energy is being reallocated to I guess changing the molecular structure for the next state. Then the temperature starts to increase again as it goes into water, and then it flatlines again before going into steam. So I guess what youre getting at is that energy becomes transmuted into the next state before it can start to give off energy in the form of profit, productivity  its giving back economic substance to its users. And I think thats sort of the analogy youre drawing there?", "image": null}

Or when it leaps from fiat to Bitcoin! Theres this phase transition, and we see it throughout all areas of science, but right now this is just the first time in human history that we see this creation of pure digital monetary network! And I want to replace monetary network with energy network, because monetary energy is energy! And money is energy! In fact, money is the highest form of energy! So if we ask the question, What is money? Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel. So if I look back through time, human beings as a species prosper by channeling energy. And when we mastered fire, we channeled chemical energy. And when we mastered missiles we channel kinetic energy. And when we master water and hydraulics, were actually channeling gravitational energy. The idea of an aqueduct is, well, Im using gravity to move water 70 miles! Or Im running a water wheel, or Im floating a 2-ton block in the water and the gravitys pushing down on the water and the water is pushing up! And when I dam a stream and I generate hydro energy, well thats gravity being converted into energy. But if I dam the stream to divert a bunch of fish into my pond, Im still using gravity! Now, I can channel gravity by dumping a bunch of rocks on your head, but its not nearly so easy to create a river of rocks as it is to just tap into a river of water! And so the mastery of fire and water is the mastery of chemical energy, gravitational energy, eventually thermal energy, and the modern era morphed into the mastery of electrical energy and atomic energy. And of course theres conservation of energy, and when we look at all of these energy networks, I mean look  100 guys with bows and arrows are an energy network! Im moving kinetic energy from this side of the battlefield to that side of the battlefield! And a civilization at the mouth of a river with cities up and down the river is sitting on an energy network, just like the Aegean, and the Greek civilization was sitting at the middle of an energy network and they were using gravitational energy. And wind energy  another form of energy between sails and gravity  Im taking advantage of these energies! So the theme is: humans prosper by channeling energy. Now, whats the most efficient energy network in the history of the world? Well its about to be Bitcoin! Because the challenge of humanity is: how do I store energy and transmit energy across time and space and domain? And by domain I mean perhaps governmental domain  like how do I move my energy from New York to Tokyo? And this becomes an interesting question! Lets take a typical power grid: well I generate power, I channel chemical energy into electrical energy, I lose like 35% of the energy in the coal or in the fossil fuel. When it gets onto the grid, I move it over a high voltage line, and I can move it up to about 500 miles and I lose 2% of the energy. Now it has to get stepped down to 240 volts or lower voltage even, to get into your house. As the voltage steps down, I lose more energy  its about a 4% loss. If I had pure energy at the power plant, Im gonna lose 6% of the energy to put it into your house 250 miles away! I cant send 2,000 miles away  I just cant I cant send it 10,000 miles away  energy will not move from New York to Tokyo. But I can New York to Schenectady! Now when it gets into your house, you have to use it immediately! You cant store it! So lets say I wanted to store it  I need a battery! Well the absence of a battery prevents a mechanism. The mobile wave is a function of Lithium ion batteries in the palm of your hand  no Lithium ion battery, no smart phone! Now were working with modern batteries. Tesla: its all about the battery, right? And Elon Musk has really driven battery technology! So lets say I put a battery in your house. And you pull energy into your house. Well youve lose 6%! Now a typical battery  a good one  is gonna lose 2% per month! Okay, that means youre gonna lose 24% of your energy a year! Well what does that sound like? It sounds like 24% inflation a year! It sounds like hyperinflation  it could get worse, right? Hyperinflation is 100% inflation a year! Lets say that I have a battery which loses 20% of my power a year, well my half-life on my energy that I pulled off the plant is 3.5 years in 10 years! Im down to 12.5% of my energy! So the entire civilization is based upon electric power grids and networks, and yet its not that good! I mean you really cant store that much power! Anybody that ever put their computer, they charged it and left the computer for a month or 2 months and you whipped it open, its like  its drained!", "image": null}

And those savings themselves are the result of all our collective energy utilization up until that point. Weve been transitioning energy into capital, and then gold, or money, becomes the network that commands that capital, and then what I think is interesting too is that the scarcity of the gold actually reflects the scarcity of the energy. So it maps onto it in a way.", "image": null}

And now lets play a thought experiment: lets take our $100 Million worth of monetary energy and lets put it in a power network that runs on copper, and then lets put it into a gold network! If I put it into a copper energy network, I have 24% bleed rate per year by the time it gets to the battery. I lose 6%, and I cant get it more than 500 miles. Okay, so its a very short term, short duration, here and now energy network. Lets put it into a gold network: I put $100 Million into gold. Now I can move that $100 Million of gold 100 miles  would I lose 6%? Probably not 6%! I could probably move $100 Million of gold 100 miles for $10,000-$100,000 depending on how much security I need! So were talking about 10 basis points, instead of 600 basis points of loss. 10 basis points! So gold is a more efficient way to move large amounts of energy for short distances. What if I want to move $100 Million of gold 10,000 miles? Well, thats about 3,000 lbs of gold, 1.5 tons. So I put it on a global express, it costs $10,000 an hour, I put some dudes with guns on it, I fly 1618 hours around the world  thats about $180,000 plus another $70,000. $250,000. If I have to fly the plane back  lets just assume I dont! Its $250,000, so now were up to like 25 basis points. 0.25% is the cost to move it around the world once! Okay? So thats okay. Now what if I want to deliver $100 Million of gold 100 years into the future? What if I wanted to deliver $100 Million of energy 100 years into the future on copper and batteries? Well my half-life is at 24% at 2% bleed a month. My half-life is 3.5 years. Its gone completely! And everybody with any common sense knows if you put your laptop charged in your attic for 100 years, it will not be charged in 100 years! You cannot store electricity on a copper network or a Lithium ion battery, its no good! I put it in gold, put it in a vault. So lets say I put it in a vault in J.P. Morgan in 1900 in the United States of America. And the United States is the most successful country in the 20th century: we win every war, and J.P. Morgan remains as a bank and the vault in New York remains. In that case, assuming a 2% mining rate, assuming a stock to flow of 50 and miners mine 2% more gold a year, the half-life of a gold battery is 35 years. I go from $100 Million to $50 Million in 35 years, to $25 Million in 70 years. So about $12.5 Million in 100 years! So Ive depleted my gold battery 87% if the United States wins every war, and if J.P. Morgan isnt a corrupt institution and doesnt fail, and if no one drops a nuclear bomb on New York City! If those things dont happen then I will get 12% of my money back!", "image": null}

We have a gold network and we want to move money, so I put $100 Million in gold and I want to move it around  well its 25 basis points every time I want to move it around. If I want to move it once a quarter, its 1% bleed a year if I move it once a quarter. If I mine it its 2% bleed a year. That gets me to 3% bleed a year. Divide that into 70 and every 22 years  thats the half-life of gold. Energy on a gold network has a half-life of 22 years at best! When you throw in the counterparty risk and the need to move it around  lets just assume that we move it around so you dont lose it! Youre just down to now the issue of technology and commodity risk. And this is an important point: gold is the king of commodities! Gold is the greatest of all human commodities! But my first job at DuPont was I built computer simulations of commodities and specialty chemical networks, and let me tell you what people in that business think: they think commodity is a dirty word! The first thing I learned is: commodity is awful! Nobody wants to be in a commodity business! And heres the reason commodities are awful: if I actually create a factory that creates a commodity, say, gasoline  the only thing it can do is create gasoline! If I invest $10 Billion into gasoline refinery, my fixed cost are $10 Billion. The ideal, rational price for me to make a profit? Probably at $4 a gallon? But my variable cost is $1.50 a gallon, because Ive got all these billions of dollars in the factory! What happens is, when I create commodity refineries, when the price below the profitable point, I will still keep running the factory, because Ive got a variable margin. Im generating cash flow even though Im driving the price down for everybody else in the business. So its possible in the commodity business for every single producer to be losing money! And for them to all be acting irrationally, and theyre all pumping out the commodity be it silver  if youre a gold miner, what can you do other than mine gold? Once Ive gone and Ive invested $100 Billion in mining gold, if the price of gold is cut in half, but my variable cost is $400 an ounce and its $800 an ounce, Im mining gold and selling it at $800 an ounce! Im selling it at $700 an ounce! Im selling it at $600! When it gets to $500, Im selling it because the market is not rational  I cant transmute my $100 Billion of gold mining capital into Google stock!", "image": null}

Maybe a certain government wants to mine gold! Maybe I cant legally stop even if I wanted to stop! So when you have a commodity business where people have specialized capital and they make those investments, what happens over time everywhere in every industry in every commodity in the history of the world is: the producers overproduce the commodity because, in the phrase of Hotel California, You can check in anytime you want, but you cant ever leave! Its a one-way route! You go in, you cant get out! So that takes us to this real issue of gold, or the real risk of gold, which is: gold prices goes up by a factor of 10, capital gets attracted into commodity production. Its a feedback: people produce more, gold price goes down, people keep producing to try to recover their cash flows, lots of intelligent people become desperate. When men are desperate, they invent new techniques to produce more gold. They keep producing because they dont have a choice! They will produce down until the variable cost equals the price, then they will keep producing below variable cost, because its possible that theyre in a situation where they can lay off  for example: a government that takes ownership of a gold mine will produce below variable cost in order to maintain jobs.", "image": null}

If I want to keep jobs  and how many countries want to project jobs  if I want to project jobs, I will produce something and sell it below the variable cost. We do that with anything that is politically charged! When a government decides: education, healthcare, transportation, automobiles, local manufacturing, security, defense  defense is a great example of something that we produce whether we like it or not at a cost thats higher than potentially the value and use of it!

It takes us back to why Marjorie Merriweather Post was the richest woman in the world! Because Post cereal was starch was stable in a box for a year! Stability at room temperature! Like, Coca-Cola is stable at room temperature in a can. And gold is stable energy! So yeah its energy but nonetheless its a commodity, and you know what they call a business when its been totally wrecked? They call it commoditized! [inaudible] And so every businessperson forever has always strived to avoid being commoditized! Thats the origin of branding, right? We branded sugar water, we branded Gucci bags, we branded everything. We patent things, we brand things, because we want to avoid the inevitable result! The result is: as soon as something is commoditized and open to the public and anybody can produce it, its value goes to the variable cost of production and then it goes below! For example, Apple Computer  worth $2 Trillion today  Google, worth more than a Trillion, Facebook. These are valuable networks! But are they the most valuable networks? No! Theyre not the most valuable networks to humanity  theyre the most valuable non-commoditized networks! Because if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on Google, its inconvenient. But if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on the power company, its deadly! If I cut off your power and your water or even turn off the bridge  people die! If I turn off Google, Facebook, and Apple  nobody in New York Citys going to die, right? And so people forget this! And this is the danger of putting all your wealth, of storing your wealth in Apple stock! The world thinks Apple, Google, Facebook  Big Tech  theyre a store of value! And post-pandemic, everybody surged into the NASDAQ five, and the NASDAQ, because of Big Tech equity  this is a store of value! Ill be safe here! Well youll be safe there for a year, or two years, but you know, General Electric and General Motors and Standard Oil were once, they were the most important networks on Earth, and they changed humanity a lot more than Google, Apple, and Facebook did! And you want to change your life? Try to go a week without electricity and see if there arent riots, murders, mayhem! So people dont ask the question, Why is it that I get my electricity for nothing? Why do I get my water for nothing? Because you try to go 3 days without water, 3 days without electricity, you see what thats like! And the answer is: because those two things got declared as public utilities  that theyre so important that nobody have a monopoly on it! As soon as Standard Oil became so instrumental that it changed the Western world, politicians got interested in Standard Oil! And if your power company said, We just decided to jack the cost of electricity by a factor of 10. Would you pay it? Sure youd pay it, right? Would you complain? Who would you complain to? A politician, right? So weve got these networks, theyre really important! But eventually if theyre important enough, they become commodity networks. And so thats an interesting characteristic. The reason that gold doesnt work over time is  we have two examples. It doesnt work over time because people produce 23% more of it every year, and over 100 years that means you lose 90% of your energy. It doesnt work over time because theres counterparty risks, and the Polish bank, through no fault of their own, got overrun by the Nazis in World War II, and Beijing bank got overrun by first one regime then another regime then a third regime! So thats another reason it doesnt work! And a third reason it doesnt work is if the people become threatened by the network  so for example 1933, Franklin Delanor Roosevelt found gold to be inconvenient  if the people become threatened, they complain to the politicians. The politicians might go ahead and take action, and in this case, the reason they were able to take action is because all the gold was sitting in the same place! So if the golds sitting in a vault and we know where it is, and its under the control of institutions, the institutions are under control of government and therefore that heightens the counterparty risk because of the centralized nature of gold. So the best case for a gold network is youre gonna lose 90% of your energy over 100 years! But the likely case is youre gonna lose 95%-98% of your energy over 100 years. And if we look at Nicholas Talebs range of outcomes, if you take the 100 biggest cities in the world and you put your gold in the best bank in any of the hundred cities in the world, it looks like in 9596 of them or maybe 99 of them, you lost all your money! You lost all your gold!", "image": null}

Every good technology is smarter, faster, stronger! Every technology! Smarter, faster, stronger! So coming to digital gold versus gold: physical gold is not fast enough! How fast is it? If I wanted to move $100 Million of gold, as we talked about, its gonna cost me $250,000. So thats an impedance! But how long is that gonna take you? A week? A month? Somewhere between  you wanna move 3,000 lbs of gold from New York? Ive got a month Im guessing, if you want to get all the protocols set up. So youre talking about a quarter-million dollars and a month to move the gold. Assuming I needed another custodian and I used Bitcoin, and I wanted to move $100 Million to Bitcoin  and this is where Bitcoin critics are just utterly wrong and missing the point!  they all think, Oh, well it takes 30 minutes and $5 to move Bitcoin! And theyre comparing it to a new crypto network that has no value on it! And theyre saying, I can find a way to move it in 5 minutes for a nickel  but thats not the point! The appropriate comparison is to gold! How long would it take to move $100 Million of gold? Because theres $250 Trillion in assets in the alt-assets! And theres only $25 Billion of real assets in the altcoins or the alt-cryptos. So how long does it take me to move the $250 Trillion around? And when you think about that you realize that Bitcoin would move it in 30 minutes instead of 30 days. Okay? Thats 1,440x as fast! A thousand times as fast a minute versus 1,440 minutes in a day. And so its a thousand times as fast, but then its $5 versus $250,000! So thats 50,000x cheaper! So now weve got people saying, Oh well its very energy efficient  blah blah blah! Well its not, really! Its inefficient in the way that its inefficient to create an electro high speed transit system, a mass-transit system. It was expensive to build the mass-transit system, it got really really cheap to move onto the rails! If you look at the history of railroads, the biggest thing in the 19th century was railroads. It was pretty expensive to create the railroads! It became really cheap to move on the rails! So what we do is weve created crypto rails in order to make it 50,000x cheaper to move! But its not just that its 50,000x cheaper, its that its 1,000x faster and 50,000x cheaper, and then when you start to multiply 1,000 x 50,000, and you realize  it starts to be 50,000,000x faster, and then you start to add that third dimension, which is maybe a computer that thinks about this while youre sleeping 18,000 times, and you realize eventually you get to 50,000,000,000x faster! And now weve got to a new engineering or new scientific metaphor which is: superconducting networks! Theres impedance going through an electric power network and youre losing it, so the solution is that I need to get this superconducted! So I gotta cool the network down to close to near-zero, and its expensive! And the point is: Yeah! Its expensive to get to near-zero, and then the impedance disappears in the network and the friction goes away! And what could you do if the friction went completely away?", "image": null}

Get out of the gravity well, throw the baseball, itll go around the Earth forever! So how much more distance do you get out of the baseball if you pay the price of getting out of the gravity well?

Its something thats just altogether unique and weve just never had it before! If you now conceptualize that and you go through your thought experiment, you realize: we need a monetary system, and our monetary systemthe three in front of our face are, lets take itfiat is a monetary system, gold is a monetary system, Bitcoin is a monetary system. If I put my $100 Million of monetary energy  I have energy. I take energy, I sell it on the grid, you give me money! I take my money, I put it into the US dollar bank  its in fiat. I wait 100 years, and its 78% asset inflation rate, I have a half-life of 10 years, so I get cut in half 10 times! Okay? $100 Million$50 Million$25 Million$12 Million  its gonna get painful!$6 Million$3 MillionI only cut in half 5 times!$1.5 Millionthats 6 times, now it gets really painful!70 basis points35 basis points17 basis points8 basis points! By the way, 8 basis points if you dont get hyperinflation! 8 basis points if your nation wins every war! So were not even  what to say is: youre losing 99% of your energy. 99% of your energy is being charitable! Now lets generate $100 Million worth of electricity by burning coal or nuclear power or peddling on my flywheel or rowing on my row machine  however you got to it  windmills! Lets sell it to the grid, take the $100 Million, and lets to go J.P. Morgan and lets buy $100 Million worth of gold and lets have them custodian for me. Put it in their vault  I guess I could just take it with me, its 3,000 lbs! Its $2,000 an ounce, or whatever the number is! Okay so 1.5 tons  no! I gotta put it in a vault, right? So I put it in a vault and I pay for custody fees and going in theres a fee, and then Im paying, whatever, 20, 30, 40 basis points a year to keep it, and then the miners are out there doing their mining thing and its probably 200 basis points worth of additional gold. So thats 250 basis points a year. And if I watch it and assuming its just a dead rock and its heavy, Im not moving it  Im doing nothing with it, Im just staring at it  then Ive just gotta add on the counterparty risk and then the fracking risk, or the technology risk. The fracking risk is  academics always opine about shortages. Academics have been saying theres an oil shortage, and energy shortage coming! Theyve been saying it since the Club of Rome in 1973 or something! They said it in the 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, and the world always predicted that we were gonna run out of oil or energy in about 10 years. I studied this at MIT  I created computer simulations about it. Theres an entire school of thought  system dynamics  that studies these things. And the flaw in the reasoning is: its a linear interpretation of the world instead of a closed feedback or a non-linear interpretation of the world. The linear interpretation of the world is: weve got 10 years worth of oil because thats what our main proven reserves are! The closed loop interpretation of the world is: when we actually get to 5 years worth of reserves, people start looking for more reserves! And so, no company wants to carry on their balance sheet more than about 10 years worth. And then they just keep finding more, but they dont publish it. Were not factoring in human will to live, human ingenuity! People have a tendency that when you tell them theyre about to run out of something, they reprioritize, they think a little bit harder, and they come up with an innovative solution! So thats what happened with fracking. Were gonna run out of oil, we had a crisis, and eventually the price of oil went high enough. The people sat down and said, You know? If we invent a new chemistry, and if we raised some capital, we can go ahead and implement fracking, and we doubled the amount of oil! And we did it fast! We had 5 Million barrels a day for like 40 years and that was conventional wisdom and everybody thought, Thats it! And then we went the next year to 6 Million, the next year to 7 Million, the next year to 8 Million, the next year to 9 Million, the next year to 10 Million! And I watched it happen, and I watched all of the big investment bankers  J.P. Morgan and the like  they went and they raised billions of dollars from investors and they invested in these fracking companies, in Chesapeake Energy and all these others popped up, and we were awash with oil! And the next thing you read is that we have too much oil! Because its a commodity! Because if you put $100 Billion into anything, you invent something new! So for you to be a  this is why being a cynic and being a pessimist about technology is generally a losing trade, because youre assuming that human beings wont invent anything new and have no capability to do it different!", "image": null}

And if you study the history of science, the history of science is very simple: the non-scientist and non-believers that will tell you why its impossible, and then the creative, innovative scientist who thought, Im gonna ignore thatand just go try it. And 99% of the population generally will just tell you why its impossible and be cynical and be critical and theyre fearful. And the 1% will say, I think Ill just go try it! And of course the 1% is generally right! I mean, theyre wrong until theyre right! The technology fails until it succeeds. But if they just keep trying, the likelihood that youll invent electricity or airplanes or antibiotics or better techniques for agriculture or mobile phones or YouTubethe likelihood is high! It is highly likely that someone in the future will come up with a way to extract all the energy that youre ever gonna need from some element the size of a sugar cube. We dont have it yet, and I can probably find a million conventional thinkers thatll tell us why its impossible. The same guys that told John Harrison he couldnt discover longitude with a clock, and the same guys that told the Wright brothers they couldnt fly! It would be those same guysand theyll be right until theyre wrong! And in this particular case, thats a good thing! Thats a good thing if what you want is abundance. But thats why its a crippling intellectual mistake to run a monetary standard on a commodity that can be produced by man! Ultimately, you have to run a monetary system on math, right? As you pointed out before  mathematical money  because 2 + 2 = 4, and as long as 2 + 2 = 4, human ingenuity is not the enemy! And this is a basic sociological principle, really, which is: do you want to design a system assuming that people are stupid and will not evolve and cannot defeat it? Or do you want to design a system assuming people are smart and channel the energy of human ingenuity into making the system work better? And this is why gold is defective! And why a decentralized crypto network of which Bitcoin is the most successful in the history of the world  thats why it is effective, because Bitcoin is channeling human ingenuity into making it better! And every commodity is channeling human ingenuity into making it worse, as a money! So if we come back to this idea, Bitcoin is the ultimate energy network! Well were gonna bleed 99.5% of our energy on a fiat network. Were going to bleed 95% or more of our energy on a gold network. Once you calculate the fully diluted Bitcoin count  21,999,999.98, as I heard from Andreas the other day, that number just slightly less than 21 Million  once youve done that, then you just realize that its a lossless monetary energy system through time. Through space, it has a slight loss in the form of transaction fees, but its a good thing, and the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are like a little bit of impedance and/or a little bit of gravity, a little bit of friction. And the goddess of wisdom that created the universe gave us a little bit of friction  its a good thing! No gravity, no friction  your life gets really really complicated!", "image": null}

Thats why the idea that Ive gotta drive transaction fees to zero is a silly idea! Its like, No! What we want to do is drive inflation or the loss of energy over time to zero, and then we want there to be a slight loss of energy when we reorganize all of the monetary energy. When I send $100 Million from New York to Tokyo, I dont mind spending $5. I probably wont mind spending $50! When Bitcoin has $250 Trillion of energy into it, theres no reason why you cant pay $25 Billion in transaction fees! People forget  again  this is the problem of the crypto community: theyre fixated upon a prototypical coin network thats a lab experiment, and theyre comparing it to Bitcoin, instead of comparing Bitcoin to actual monetary or asset networks in the real world! So for example heres a real asset network: its called real estate! I have $100 Trillion of real estate. You have a house. Lets say you have a $1 Million house. You wanna hold  this is a good example  lets assume that real estate is my energy network! If you wanna actually carry a $1 Million house 100 years  in Florida, theres a 2% real estate tax. You would pay $20,000 a year every year for 100 years, assuming that the house was capped and not reappraised, and so youre in essence going to lose the house in 50 years! Right? Under the best of circumstances! Youre gonna lose all your wealth in about 20 years if you store your wealth or your monetary energy in a real estate network in Florida. So if you go to any other real estate jurisdiction, theyve all got different tax rates over time, but this is why you cant really store energy in property, because the tax rate generally will bleed you out in somewhere between 20-100 years. Now thats the inflation rate, or the energy loss rate over time. What about over space? What if you wanted to transfer a $100 Million house? What if I want to buy it from you? So you want to exchange  heat exchange, energy exchange  you want to exchange the energy in the house? Well its a 6% transaction fee, and at the point that I said, Robert I want to buy your house, Ill give you $1 Million bucks for it. How many days till closing? 30? Probably 30! Okay, so you just paid $60,000 and waited a month in order to do your transaction! Now compare that to Bitcoin again? 30 minutes? $6 bucks? 30 days, $60,000! This is why we dont use property as an energy network! By the way, some people do! You can ask people point blank, How are you gonna actually give your money to your granddaughter? Well Im gonna buy property. But it where? California? Florida? Where? Its the same counterparty risk! Its worse than gold! You can move 3,000 lbs of gold in 30 days for $150,000-$200,000! You cant move $100 Million worth of property in 30 days to another country!", "image": null}

Itll take you 30 days to do the transaction. Now we just come back to this fee, right? What are the transaction fees on the Visa network? What are the transaction fees across any monetary network? Its pretty routine to pay 1%, 2%, 3% to move something around. If Bitcoin gets to be $100 Trillion and theres 1% transaction fees, its going to be  well pick any number and multiply it by 1%! Its $1 Trillion a year in transaction fees! Nothing wrong with that! Whats the entire size of the  you know what the spreads are in the bond industry? Like, I used to buy and sell convertible debt. There were 200 basis point spreads. You could buy at 0.98%, you could sell at 0.96%  the banks got in between! So all of the financial system is built on taking a spread. Thats why New York City has tall buildings! Weve talked about this before. Wherever theres a node in a network  a rail head, Venice, Paris, London, New York  wherever theres a node in a central network where theres exchange, theres a transaction fee. And if youre lucky its only 1% or 2%! When youre unlucky  I mean theres a reason people refer to free ports. Free port meant that when you pull your ship into our port we werent gonna steal it all! You know what the great breakthrough is in Singapore? Heres the breakthrough: were gonna have a port in the middle of the Pacific where when the ship comes into our port, we dont take all of their cargo! Or we dont take 10% of their cargo! Thats your idea? Yeah! Thats my idea! Were gonna let them stop here and not seize 10% of their stuff! Wow! Thats a brilliant idea! By the way, thats such a unique concept that Singapore is Singapore! It is the greatest port in the Pacific  because its so rare that a country agrees not to take 3% of what you have when you stop! You cant even come into the United States without filling out a customs form where they charge you a 10% duty on whatever you have in your possession! The point is: its very common to take 10% of what you have when you come and when you leave. Thats why those cities are cities! Thats why those empires are empires! So when someone sits around and they whine about $5 in transaction fees is too great, theyre whining because its more expensive than their laboratory experiment on their scientific workbench that no ones using! Yeah, I can conceptualize hypothetically in my perfect world a perfect system where it was better. But the real world is $100 Trillion worth of real estate and $250 Trillion worth of bonds and stocks and gold and silver and other property! And that stuffs moving around with transaction fees which are high enough to have paid for all the buildings in London, Paris, New York, San Francisco, Beijing, Tokyo, Venice, and Rome! Its not a new idea to charge transaction fees! Its not a problem! And the beauty of Bitcoin is, as more miners come on, they create a very competitive industry, and if a miner charges too much transaction fees, someone else is gonna drive the cost of transaction fees down, and if the revenue from transaction fees falls below the variable cost of running the mining rigs, people are gonna take mining rigs out of production eventually  unless a government wants to subsidize them! Unless a governments gonna be subsidizing the crypto rails which create the 21st economy, and thats a reason why mining is a bit riskier as a business than owning Bitcoin! Because youre getting into a commodity business where you may get driven down to the variable cost of the electricity, or below the variable cost of the electricity if someone else wants to get into the business and they can. Its good for Bitcoin, its good for everything built above the chain! Caveat emptor if you wanna get into the commodity  or the business of encrypted energy!", "image": null}

I think thats a great point too that you bring up the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are set at fair market value.

Whereas ostensibly these government feestheyre non-consensual, theyre conducted under a monopolized area.

How good was that? Another great episode with Mr. Saylor! I think were starting to see things coming together in this episode where all of this foundation weve been laying starts to relate and highlight the significance of Bitcoin in the modern age. We started out talking about Bitcoin being the first true digital monetary network in history. There had been prior attempts with things like E-Gold and other things, but they had never solved the issue of counterparties, frankly! Weve never had a trust-minimized digital money that was basically more or less free of counterparty risk! And Saylor brings up the great point that Bitcoin  at the time that we recorded was well over $200 Billion market cap  and when you look at Bitcoin through that lens as a digital energy network, other digital energy networks like Amazon, Apple, Netflix, etc., one they pass that $100 Billion milestone, it tends to be kind of a point of no return! And also a point that leads them to realizing these winner-take-all dynamics in digital competition. And he also makes a great point that, at that point in those companies life cycles, those digital energy networks life cycles, 99% of the investment community still doesnt get it! When Amazon or Apple is at $100 Billion market cap, people were still just writing them off and didnt realize that these were gonna be even multi-trillion dollar companies today! So I thought that was really interesting that Bitcoin is really at that juncture where its crossed the multi-hundred billion dollar market cap threshold, and that gives it a lot of resiliency to disruption or downside potential, where it still has just a ton of upside potential if you look at it even in the context of golds market cap, or other stores of value. And I liked that Saylor went to how these digital networks, theyre dematerializing some ineffable quality. Like social media is friendship, or with Apple you could say maybe its information or communication, and with Bitcoin its money. And its taking that ineffable quality to a lower energy state, something thats more crystalline-like, and when it does that  using the analogy of a phase transition  lets say water going from liquid to ice, all of this thermal energy is released! And in an economic sense that would be value or cash flows or market cap. What I think he called was an exothermal reaction, where is actually collapses to a state that requires lower energy to remain cohesive, and gives off that excess energy in the form of value of some kind. I thought that was a brilliant way to look at it! And it calls to mind again standardization, right? When we achieve certain standards and everyone starts singing off the same song sheet, productivity just explodes! So our effort necessary to maintain the network collapses, so the network gains a lot of density, and then in doing that it just throws off all of this  whatever the ineffable quality is that its aiming for, whether its energy or value or productivity for instance. And then Saylor was so kind to actually answer the question that we always ask on this show, which is, What is money? And the way he puts it is that, Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel. And indeed if you go back to what we talked about in Episode 1 to those Stone Age technologies, thats what human beings have been doing to advance themselves. That is what distinguishes man from animal in fact, is that we harness energy and channel it across the field lines of our intellect, essentially. The three Stone Age technologies we looked at were: fire, missiles, and water. Fire was harnessing and channeling chemical energy, missiles were kinetic energy, and water was gravitational energy! And in the modern era, weve evolved past that and now were dealing with things like thermal energy, electrical energy, and nuclear energy! And the point that he makes is that, All of the meta-energy, if you will, that controls all of the others is money! Money is the claim on the collective savings of humanity. Its a claim on the efforts present, past, or future of all of us! So any group that commands one of these forms of energy can be commanded themselves by money. So it makes money this form of meta-energy, which I thought was a very interesting definition! [1:16:27] And its also what defines civilization in a way. Its like, What types of energy are we harnessing? Are we a Stone Age civilization thats only harnessing fire? And at what scale are we doing that? At what scale are we channeling that energy? Those two aspects are kind of what defines civilization in a lot of ways! And he makes the point too that the challenge has always been moving the energy across domain, and this domain can either be a jurisdictional or governmental domain  how do you get your capital out of one country into another with the least loss possible, it could be characterological  so if Im going from thermal energy to kinetic energy, whats the most efficient way to do that? We could look at something like the steam engine was such a breakthrough because it allowed us to transition energy the most lossless way. Or even just moving the energy across space and time! If we can harness it and store it in a medium thats reliable and then transport it somewhere else and redeem it at later times for later uses, that has a lot of value as well! As humans try to go into the world and solve problems. So in that lens, historically at least, gold was energy money! Its what captured the residual energy that mankind was able to produce, that was not able to be put to a higher and better use. So if we couldnt dedicate our efforts towards any other activity that could increase productivity more than say gold mining, then we would just go and mine gold! And gold, again being this hard energy money, would sort of be  its annual appreciation would be a proxy for the aggregate productivity growth in an economy. And unless your investment could outperform that, say its 2-3% a year, then you would just mine gold! So it kind of provided this floor for human energy, and it was a medium through which we stored and transported it. But, I love this part where Saylor went into the math behind why gold sucks! Even though it was the best thing we ever had historically, it still sucks as an energy money! One was, If you want to move gold around the world once, say it costs you 25 basis points, which on $100 Million is $250,000 just to move it around the world once! So if youre doing that once a quarter thats 1% energy loss per year. And then something  which we got into  you would almost have to do, because if youre gonna store gold, youve gotta put it in a vault. Its gotta be physically safeguarded over a long period of time, and you have to trust a counterparty. You have to trust a custodian! And as we went through history, many of these custodians and nation states have fallen over, so if you wanted to transport wealth across 100 years, you would necessarily need to change locations rather frequently just to avoid and minimize that risk! So that was across space, say it costs 1% a year to move it 45 times a year across space. And then also, gold production increases by about 2% a year, so golds got a 2% dilution built right into it from gold mining. So if you put those two together, call it 3% loss per year on this monetary energy batter  youve got a 22-year half-life! In 22 years, holding your value in gold, youre gonna get cut in half! So thats just not that great as far as building something with a long time horizon! After 100 years, youre talking about 87% loss in value if youre storing in gold! And thats your best case! Thats assuming that you move it to the right places and you dont end up storing it in a Frankfurt or Tokyo in 1900 or any of these other cities that lost a war or their institutions were compromised. This assumes that you make the right moves with it! Your best case is lets say a 90% loss in value. Your worst case is 100% because of confiscation outright, or theft. If youre Poland and Germany invaded your country your gold was stolen! And Bitcoin is just fundamentally different because its this form of money thats digitized energy! So its not stored in a physical corporeal form that can be seen, targeted, confiscated. Its informational, which allows you a lot of unique ways to custody it in these ultra-high security schemas that are largely resistant to these forms of counterparty risk that weve seen gold succumb to in the past. And then we got into commodities, the economic principles surrounding them. [1:21:54] And I liked how he described gold mining in that the cap-ex deployed into gold mining is really largely for the purpose of mining gold, and the switching costs related to it are very high, so you cant just turn your gold miner off and start mining silver, right? In some cases, depending on the actual piece of equipment, it only may be useful for mining gold. But assuming its useful for mining something else, you have to pull it out of the mine, put it on a truck or a ship, ship it somewhere else, redeploy it, not to mention all the training and security involved with that! So very high switching cost on the cap-ex related to gold mining, and this leads to specialized producers overproducing! So theyll overproduce this commodity  gold  down to the point where marginal revenue is equal to marginal cost, so theres no profit. And even below at times. Again theyre trying to amortize the cost of this cap-ex that invested in gold mining. Or, it could also possibly  if they get desperate enough  they could also seek a government subsidy that can allow them to mine below the cost of capital even further! And so all of this leads to commodity money getting destroyed! The incentives are to always increase its supply and always compress its margins. The way Saylor puts this is that the energy being channeled into commodity production, its actually  the incentives related to it  are targeting human ingenuity at destroying that commodity! Youre commodifying it, which is to say compressing its profit margin and increase its supply! Whereas those incentives in Bitcoin are fundamentally different, which well touch on shortly. But the interesting thing here with gold as a commodity or energy money is that it was a stable form of energy at room temperature. Which as we touched on in prior episodes, is akin to the breakthrough with consumer packaged goods, with Post foods, so they could store food energy at room temperature in the form of corn flakes or other canned or dried goods. This also points to commodification at least points to this interesting configuration in the world where we have, say, the electric and water networks. And in our civilization theyre clearly the most important, right? If you turned off electricity or water, chaos would ensue! Whereas if you turned off say Google or Amazon, it might be inconvenient, but its not necessarily gonna be this whole breakdown in society! But, Amazon and Google are tremendously more valuable on a market cap basis than electric and water networks, and the answer to why is because electric and water networks are commodified. They have become this network thats so fundamental to civilization that weve optimized how we produce and distribute these goods in a way that makes them ultra-cost effective to the consumer. Whereas things like Amazon or Google, they havent been commoditized yet. Theyre still new enough, theyre newly explored industrial territory if you will. Theres still very large margins there and theyre also monopolists. As we saw earlier in the Steel Age in the railroads and whatnot, in these newly charted industrial spaces you tend to have monopolies first before commodification. First of all the monopolists set standards. Once the standards are set, the commodification sets in and actually compresses the margin and leads us to the more free market environment we have today! So commodification also points to why FAANG stocks  which are being predominantly used as a store of value today  since the store of value function of fiat has been so compromised, we see a lot of institutional capital pulls, high net worth individuals, everyone really, that would typically depend on fiat currency as a store of value, resorting to the FAANG stocks or other high-flying tech stocks, as a store of value! Something that is reliably scarce enough to hold its value across time. But commodification  the history of it, and the economic principles behind it  actually point towards why thats a really bad strategy for the long run! Because were early in the digital age, these data monopolies, although they could be expected to persist for some time  years, possibly even decades  its very unlikely that the large profit margins theyre enjoying today will persist far into the future. Whats more likely is that now that standards are established, well see commodification of some of these digital utilities that are monopolized today! If history is any indicator. So in that way the FAANG stocks, although theyre like a primary store of value today maybe second only to government bonds, and increasingly so now that government bonds are largely going negative, they make for a really poor long term store of value. And this also points to Bitcoin and the uniqueness of it in that Bitcoin is like the ultimate store of value through this lens of commodification, because it actually resists commodification! So Bitcoin mining is this race to produce hashes more cheaply. Were thinking about hash as a vote or a lottery ticket trying to solve the puzzle to win the coinbase reward, which is the newly minted Bitcoin in every block every 10 minutes. So the commodification of Bitcoin is actually in the energy being allocated into its network, however  and this is where Bitcoin is so unique  is that, every 4 years, the algorithm adjusts itself in such a way that it actually pushes back on this commodifying force by cutting its new supply flow in half! So at the halving, the operation and energy expense being allocated to generate a hashwhich is to create Bitcoin basicallythat same cost flows into half as much Bitcoin being produced! So as Bitcoin is undergoing this downward pressure to cost of production as people figure out how to generate hashes more cheaply with cheaper energy or better ASICs or whatever the breakthrough is, the algorithm pushes back every 4 years! Youre pressing down cost to production in one way, but every 4 years were gonna double it! And thats actually the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin so interesting, because that keeps ratcheting its marginal cost of production higher, and as we know by studying commodities and money, that the marginal cost of revenue or the market price tends to converge to the marginal cost of production. So the algorithm actually has this rising floor cost of production, and thats whats ratcheting its market price higher and higher! And if you look at the price action of Bitcoin historically on the log scale matched over these halvings you see it perfectly! Its not to say that that will hold indefinitely into the future, but its definitely very unique in that weve never seen an asset that has this  at least were 12 years in  very predictable and algorithmically driven market value. Its definitely influenced by the algorithm! So thats really interesting and really unique to economics. The other thing thats interesting to me about that is its inverting the economic principles behind commodification. So if you think: the ratcheting effects in, say, gold production will actually be to produce gold more cheaply over time. So just make gold more and more cheaply over time, which actually points to why gold was selected as money because it was so resistant to commodification! You couldnt get the cost of gold production lower because its so scarce and hard to produce! But because Bitcoins pushing back, instead of all of that energy flowing into producing cheaper Bitcoin, its actually pushing us to just seek out cheaper energy, so its created this global perpetual incentive scheme to figure out cheaper ways to make energy. Because thats the only way to access cheaper Bitcoin production, effectively, although Bitcoin just keeps getting harder to produce! [1:32:23] So its just really really unique economics to think about! And then we went into the settlement aspects of Bitcoin, and why comparing it to another crypto asset is simply the wrong comparison. Saylor made a great point that, if you want to compare the cost to settle in Bitcoin, you have to compare it to gold, because with gold, you are settling in finality. If I flip you a gold coin, you put it in your pocket and walk away, you and I have participated in an irreversible transaction! Theres no authority in the world that can make you give me that coin back, and theres no authority in the world that can  aside from gold mining  that can devalue that coin! So weve transferred a token of self-sovereign wealth. It is a final transaction, a final settlement. And theres only one other asset in the world that lets you do that in a fully depoliticized way. You could argue that Ethereum allows you to do that, but Ethereum is subject to political attack vectors, we dont know its whole supply, there is a small group of people that control its functioning, whereas its just not true for Bitcoin. Its the only truly decentralized digital asset in the world! So that points to another way to think about Bitcoin. Another analogy that we went into was the superconductive monetary network. Its a lossless energy network. So we can now transmit this meta-energy that is money across time, across space, across jurisdictional domain, governmental domain, with the least amount of loss! And the analogy there to superconductivity is that superconductivity is effectively cooling the conductive material to a very low temperature. So a very low entropy medium, and by getting the entropy out of the channel, it maximizes the flow of energy! Theres the least impedance or the least friction in the channel. And I love that analogy for Bitcoin, because thats the breakthrough that Bitcoin is, right? Its the first asset we have in history that has absolute zero-percent noise in the channel, which is: unexpected supply and inflation. Everyone knows and can agree to what the supply is and what the supply ever will be! And the other thing that analogy points toward is that its very expensive to achieve that! Theres a great deal of energy expenditure necessary to achieve superconductivity, or to achieve this breakthrough, but once you get there, you release all of these productivity gains! Again, kind of like that phase transition to a lower energy state: when it crystallizes, it just throws off this exothermic reaction of value, cash flow, profit, whatever it is! Thats what Bitcoins done! Weve now had this singular moment breakthrough which we could call the Genesis blockpretty everything from there is a step function of the algorithmthat is now releasing all of these gains into the world in terms of reducing frictions to trade, reducing the noise and theft in the channel from inflation, and then giving us a medium of wealth storage that cant be confiscated! So its taken a lot of unpredictability out of money, if you will! And that same achievement can also be analogized to achieving escape velocity, which I thought was a really cool analogy. And that once you get  you know theres a huge expenditure to get into orbit  if you imagine a rocket, how much fuel it has to expend, how much ingenuity and design and science has to go into building a rocket to get it going fast enough away from the Earth to escape Earths gravitational field  but once you get into orbit, all of a sudden your returns on energy expending go to like near-infinity! The example Saylor gave was throwing a baseball in a baseball field. Itll go a hundred feet if youve got a strong arm. You throw that same baseball in orbit, it just goes around the Earth forever! So your returns on energy expended just explode, it just becomes astronomical! And about this Saylor said, Bitcoin is the most efficient system for channeling energy through time and space in the history of mankind. If we just sit with that for a while and really think about the profundity of something like that, and that we are the species that channel energy across time and space. Thats what distinguishes us as man! And here we have the system that has achieved this function to a higher degree than any other system weve ever created! Thats the breakthrough that Bitcoin is! Its something truly remarkable! And its why so many of us have decided to devote our life to it, talking about it, educating others! I love the engineering mindset and lens that Saylor brought to this equation. I talked about a lot of these aspects of Bitcoin previously, but I was more focused on the time side, which time too is like absolutely scarce, but its more of an experiential aspect of reality. Whereas Saylor is very focused on the energy, which is much more of an engineering or physicist aspect of reality, and much more measurable and objective than even time! So I think its kind of saying the same thing, but just speaking to a different audience in a way. I think its just really good stuff that hes bringing to the table! The last part I thought was cool about the absolute zero superconductive monetary network for achieving escape velocity, was the example of the Hubble space telescope. So for the whole history of astronomy, weve been pointing our telescopes toward the sky, but weve dealt with atmospheric distortion  something weve had to correct for, something that for certain objects far into the distance we just couldnt even see, and its all because we had this distortion of the atmospheric shell that surrounds our planet! But again once we achieved this escape velocity and we got into Earth orbit, we got a telescope up there in the form of Hubble telescope, that when we started to see our Universe in a whole new way with a whole entirely new degree of clarity and precision unlike anything we have ever seen before! Just totally free of atmospheric distortion! And its because we eliminated the frictions to visibility, if you will. Weve eliminated the frictions to communication  in this case, communicating light to the eye or light to the telescope  and it gave us this entirely new perspective on the Universe. And I think Bitcoin is just going to do something similar! Weve eliminated the atmospheric distortions, if you will, of counterparty risk, monetary inflation, commodification  all of these things that have screwed up every monetary system historically and broken civilization after civilization  all of a sudden we have this invention through Bitcoin thats like the Hubble telescope! It exists in an orbit thats beyond mans reach  which is really important, so its not vulnerable to counterparty attack vectors  we all know what the inflation rate is and ever will be, so theres no unexpected inflation. And its just a lossless energy network, as Saylor says! Its something thats a really big breakthrough! The other thing there is the price signals that it would propagate. Price signals being the coordinating force in any economy  theyve always suffered from these distortions that we just mentioned like inflation and counterparty risk and what have you  uncertainty in general, entropy, entropy in the channel. By being an entropy-less or entropy-minimized monetary channel, a Bitcoin-denominated world promises to allocate capital more efficiently than ever before! And that may sound kind of economic-nerdy when you say allocating capital, but that means putting people and assets in the right place! So theyre best satisfying wants or best solving problems for the demands of market participants! So it will lead us to a world where more of our desires are more easily satisfied. This is a really really big deal! And Saylor talked too  I like this  that theres kind of two types of people: we have the doers in the world, and we have the nay-sayers. I would also say we could call those the tinkerers and the bureaucrats, or the entrepreneurs and the legislators. And what distinguishes these two people is: one is action-oriented  willing to fail, willing to take risks, willing to put their skin in the game, whereas the other one is just contrarian  says things cant be done. I flash back to the example of the Wright brothers where every intellectual in the worldthere was basically consensus among them all that man would never fly! Until these two guys flew in their garage. So its a really idea to bet against human ingenuity. If history shows nothing else, its that we have this amazing ability to problem-solve in a way that we cant even fathom! So the point being  when we looked at a commodity money versus something like Bitcoin  is that its a really bad idea to try and run a monetary system based on a commodity. Its much better to run a monetary network which is intended to be a system for allocating our time and our energy based on math! Based on a system that has inviolable rules or one that incentivizes fair play versus a twisting of the rules, because that would actually produce the best outcome, and the best moment of play. When rules are fixed, players are gonna play the game to the best of their ability. But when rules are bendable or breakable, youre actually creating incentives to behave in a corruptive or exploitative way. And thats what Bitcoin is. Through that game theoretical lens you could say that its a fixed rule set that no one can change or manipulate. And looking at a money based on a commodity versus a money based on math, Bitcoin is actually channeling human ingenuity in a way that causes it to improve over time, and in a way that causes civilization to improve. Whereas a commodity money is gonna be channeling human energy and ingenuity into the compression of the profit margins on that commodity, and the overproduction of that commodity! So it makes so much more sense to be in a true, digital money with a rule set based in math, versus something based on our ability to produce it in the natural world! Its such a leap forward in innovation and in potentially civilization advance as well that its hard to even comprehend how big of a deal this is! And finally we touched on the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network. So although its a lossless monetary system, there is a need  theres always going to be a need  for some resistance in the channel, which we would call transaction fees. And this is essentially the fee were paying to the miners for securing the network. And we could think, as Saylor alluded to, the goddess of wisdom always introduced a little bit of friction! Its kind of like all things exist in opposition. We need something to push against to move forward. You could also think of the transaction fees as the expense or the tax were paying to the governors of the network, which the enforcers of the rules are the miners. So in the same way you pay taxes to the government ostensibly to protect and preserve your private property rights, in the Bitcoin universe we actually have to pay this tax to the mining network so that they can secure the monetary network itself and preserve our private property rights in the Bitcoin time chain. So to argue that a crypto asset needs to eliminate the transactions is just sort of ignorant of this fundamental truth that we need it in a monetary network. What we need truly in a monetary network is zero unexpected energy loss or inflation, which Bitcoin provides. So I hoped you guys enjoyed that episode! Again that was our first session on Day 2. Were now into Bitcoin theory, were getting into the Modern Age and its only going to get more interesting from here, so Ill see you in the next episode!", "image": null}

Welcome to another meeting of the Michael Saylor Appreciation Society. Our special guest today is Michael Saylor himself, fresh from the Bitcoin for Corporations conference in which he promoted Bitcoin to corporate America. He made a very very strong case for Bitcoin, why it matters for corporations, and why it matters for corporate balance sheets. Weve had Michael on beforewe spoke about his ideas on Bitcoin and his ideas on inflation and cost of living, and hes been an absolute thunderball of inspiration and powerful ideas since coming into the Bitcoin space over the last year! And its an absolute pleasure to have him back again! Thank you very much for coming back, Michael!", "image": null}

Michael Saylor on The Fiat Standar\u202ad\u202c", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-bitcoin-standard-podcast-34-michael-saylor-on-the-fiat-standar-d-f8e926834030?source=user_profile---------21-------------------------------", "body": "Michael Saylor [04:44]: My impression was: I was surprised at how much enthusiasm there is! We started in August, we were the first public company to make a serious commitment, and then Square followed us, and then Marathon Patent did a pretty big Bitcoin acquisition for their balance sheet a few weeks ago, $150 Million. And then when Tesla did, weve now got four public companies in a row that have all made pretty material commitments! Of course, the markets been enthusiastic! Generally, the markets been very supportive of all the Bitcoin companies. If you look at Squares stock, PayPals stock, Riot Blockchains stock, Marathons stock, Microstrategys been well treated, I think Tesla of course is the most successful stock of the year. Weve checked off one question, which was, How will public shareholders view this? And there was some trepidation, and in fact theyve viewed it enthusiastically! For example, since Marathon did their $150 Million Bitcoin acquisition, their stock doubled! If youre wondering how the public shareholders will view it, oftentimes the thing that holds back public companies from doing something is their concern about how it will be perceived by their outside shareholders. And because its very difficult to meet with outside shareholders  theyre changing every minute of the day between 9:30 and 4:00 PM, right? Your shareholder base is changing! So its like trying to grab onto a whirlpool in the middle of an ocean! You cant quite get your hands around it  its dynamic! Thats a challenge, but as we came in the conference I thoughtfirst of all, theres a lot of demand bubbling up! We had a lot of people asking us! A lot of people asking us, Howd you do this? What should we do? Theres illegal issues, regulatory issues, where you trip the 1940 Act, are you gonna need an ETF, whats the accounting treatment for it, whats the appropriate corporation governance? You know, rather than try to have one meeting at a time  Saifedean, you realize at some point, if you had 40 hours of meetings a week for the next 30 years, well thats like 2,000 times 30, right? What is that, 6,000? You can touch 6,000 people in 30 years! You just cant go fast enough! So you cant do these one at a time. So we thought, lets just go ahead and add it as a track to Microstrategy World, which was all virtual, and I thought  by the way, Microstrategy World last year was 2,500 of our customers in a room and it cost us $4 Million, and it cost them probably another $6 Million, so we spend $10 Million in 2019 to put 2,500 customers into a convention center. This years Microstrategy World, we probably spent 1/15th that much money, our customers spent nothing, so we spent probably 1/30th! We reduced our travel and entertainment and event budget by 97%! We reduced all of our travel and events budget by 98% year over year, if you want an interesting factoid  98%! So Microstrategy World was pulled off for 97% less money, we had 21,000 people registered instead of 2,500. We thought, Well tack on Bitcoin for Corporations as an afterthought. I thought, Well if we get 800 thatll be good! Then I thought, Well well probably get 1,000. Then I thought, Well well get 2,000! And I went on television and I said, Well I think well get 2,000, and then we had this surge, and the day of the event  no joke, it broke the Internet! Like it actually broke our video server, and the stress was, we blew through 15,000 people and I was on the phone with my IT people saying, Get more capacity from our vendor! And for like an hour or two hours in the morning leading up to the noon thing we were like maxed out and I was worried! So some enterprising cyber hornets  I love the Bitcoiners, theyre so enterprising!  while Im trying to solve the problem the conventional way, someone turns on livestreaming to YouTube, and they set up bootleg live streaming channels that have thousands of people on them! When we finally got to the noon session with Ross  who you introduced me to by the way I think, thank you! so we got to the noon session with Ross and we had 8,500 come into that session, so I thought Id have 2,000 and we went to 8,500! I thought Id have 1,500 companies represented, and it was actually 7,000 companies represented in the live session! And then the live session got bootlegged out and posted on YouTube, went viral, I think were up to 250,000 views now! [09:58] So I guess the summary would be: exceeded my expectations! And we had people from Space X there, you know, some of Elon Musks companies, we had people from Marathon there. The ones you would expect were there, but of course theres an avalanche of private companies, and there were a decent number of public companies and treasurers and CFOs that were lurking. Some of them dont want to have their names mentioned as you can imagine, because its a sensitive topic, right? Its material for a company! But I think we can call it a success, because on television for the past few days, weve had the CEO of GM asked if hes gonna invest in Bitcoin, weve had the CFO of Twitter asked about Bitcoin, weve had the CEO of Uber asked about Bitcoin! We just had the Miami, Francis Suarez, announce that theyre moving forward to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, and its become part of the conversation, even to the extent that now people are grappling with the accounting and the volatility issues, which I account to be an incredible success for all of us! Because a year ago, no one would have even discussed this! This morning we had a milestone: in the CFO section of the Wall Street Journal, the challenges of incorporating Bitcoin on the balance sheet for CFOs was discussed in an article, and I think thats the first time that the Wall Street Journal in the CFO section had ever actually brought up the topic of Bitcoin! So the implication is: its in the conversation everywhere! And increasingly, people have to come to terms with why theyre not doing it. And there will be technical reasons  Oh! Its volatile, right? I mean, its going up 200% a year, but its going up, its making us large sums of money in a volatile fashion, thats a technical reason. If youre an investor and your reason for not investing in something is, Its making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion  Im not even gonna say what I think of that! Its quite amusing to me! [12:14] But if I had to be criticized, I think Id like to be criticized for making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion! And then theyre grappling with the accounting issues, because if you hold it as the underlying asset, its currently accounted for as an intangible on the balance sheet, which is the most conservative way. Kind of like the way youd account for patents or things like that. You know, if you hold it as a fund, then it may, under certain circumstances, be accounted for as an investment asset. But then if you have a fund, its a security! And if you hold the asset, its property and a commodity! And if you have a lot of securities, at some point you might trip the SEC 1940 Act and become a finance company, because you have more than 40% of your assets as securities. There are a lot of nuances and people are grappling with them, but theyre good debates, right? Good discussions to be having right now! And a year ago, no one would have even considered these matters! So we have injected this into the conversation I think around the world, and I think the Bitcoin conference was part of it. Clearly the Tesla purchase was helpful! And I think February 8th, you could call Mainstream Day, Saifedean! February 8th, this year, was the date when the entire story of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset crossed outside of the Bitcoin and the Crypto community, and it was in the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Irish News, The Straits Times  every major financial publication everywhere in the world, and all the mainstream media! I got invited the next day to go on CNBC, Bloomberg, FOX, CNN, NPR! And Im like, No more! I cant do any more! But the point is, CNN, NPR  these are not Bitcoin journalists, these are mainstream sources! So I think the message is exploding into the mainstream  you could start the clock: February 8th was the day the shot was heard around the world! And that, combined with the Bitcoin for Corporations Summit, placed this in the public domain. The beauty now of course it, I used to meet with 100 people, and I could meet with 10 a week, and then we met with 8,000 people, and then it went viral to 250,000 people, and now weve published our Bitcoin Playbook, and thats out there circulating amongst lawyers and accountants and advisors and investors, and we just let that percolate and I think good things will happen!", "image": null}

I was going to say the exact thing that you mentioned which is: one year ago, none of this was going on anywhere! Nobody was talking about any of this stuff! I remember exactly it was one year ago, it was a conference, and I was with somebody who works in a Bitcoin company  they were talking about some blockchain nonsense  and I was telling them that the case for corporations really is: hold a small part of your balance sheet in Bitcoin! And especially if youre operating internationally, it will help you get around banking closures and itll protect you from inflation also! The response I used to get when Id mention this to people was always, No! Its too volatile! And the accounting would be too much of a headache! Theres no way anybody would do it! And its incredible, and its almost entirely down to you, how the conversations entirely shifted in a year now to the point where we have a complete playbook that the lawyers and accountants can just go to microstrategy.com, download your corporate playbook, and they have the complete guide to how they need to answer those questions, and weve already had thousands of them show up! So I think I cant but commend you for your incredible service to the cause! And this unbelievable contribution of just putting this out there and forcing it upon people! People call it speculation and people say, Well people are just speculating! But I think ultimately, every economic decision is speculation, and maybe the reason this speculation is paying off is because it is a better economic decision! Maybe its just that its a better asset on the balance sheet and the world is discovering that!", "image": null}

You made this point: you were talking about money progressing from soft to hard. The gold standard was the culmination of commodity monies from glass beads and seashells and stone coins and the like, and copper and brass and eventually we get to gold and gold is pinnacle and silver is next. And so gold is the hardest commodity money, it lasts the longest, and then you make the point: human beings are able to take a longer view! Your time horizon stretches out! If you had seashells as money or carved wood sticks, your time horizon wouldnt last beyond the rotting of the wood sticks. Or your time horizon wouldnt last longer than when people trekked off of the seashore to get more seashells. So gold is the hardest money of that time period, and human beings were able to take a long view. They can create longer lasting structures, right? If you have a harder money, you can create a longer lived structure and that structure would be an institution. And the hard money is working against time. Time is the impedance, and the money is flowing through time! So I started thinking about that as an engineer and I thought, Materials progress from soft to hard, and we build with wood and then we build with brick and then we build with stone and then we build with iron and then we build with steel! And steel is, right now, the winner of the materials, and using the hardest material, human beings are able to create the largest and the tallest structures! Theyre working against gravity! So time is an elemental force, gravity is an elemental force, so the significance of steel is, Im able to build a 100-story skyscraper, and the significance of strong money, or gold money, was, maybe I could create a 50 or 100-year old dynasty of some sort. Maybe I could even build a cathedral based upon the gold! Money progresses from slower to faster. When we get to Bitcoin, youve got a harder money than gold, so if its harder, that means in theory you can build structures like institutions thatll last longer than the gold institutions or the fiat institutions! I had the thought when Jack Dorsey just announced today that he put 500 Bitcoin into an institution or an endowment to finance Bitcoin development with a focus on Africa and the like. So presumably Bitcoin development, Lightning development, etc. And I thought, 500 Bitcoin will eventually be  if you dont spend it  itll be worth $500 Million! Well get to $1 Million a coin and then maybe Bitcoin will start to appreciate at 20% a year, 30%, and eventually itll slow down, but you could borrow against $500 Million$50 Million a year  which is enough to finance a development unit of hundreds of software developers! Forever! You know, a simple rule of thumb: 500 BTC might reasonably support 500 professionals working an organization forever! Okay? Why? Because Number Goes Up, its a store of value! If I put the equivalent amount of money into government bonds, the half-life is not gonna support anything, right? 500 BTC you can calculate it today  500 BTC is $25 Million, right? So $25 Million invested in something which is going up less than 20% a year is losing value! So the S&P wouldnt work, gold doesnt even work, theyre both clocking in at 15% a year! Sovereign debt doesnt work! So the NASDAQ sort of works, its going up. Big Tech sort of works, but you couldnt really say forever with Big Tech, because its tied into  its got so many risks and complexities! So if I endow an institution with the hardest money, I could reasonably have a 100-year or multi-100-year time horizon! And Id look you in the face and Id say, Yeah! It looks to me like 500 BTC will support 250 people at $200,000 a year, 500 people at $100,000 a year. I mean if youre supporting people in Africa, developers in Africa, right now the cost per engineer is $25,000-$50,000 a year, probably $25,000 a year! So you could support 500 people forever! Lets call it 1,000 years! I mean we could go back and forth, but  so hard money lets you work against time with an institution. And then I think youve got this other dimension, which is, Is it smarter and is it faster? Bitcoin is maybe 10100x harder than gold, and so we can look out hundreds and hundreds of years. But its millions of times faster than gold! I pointed this out the other day: if you have a $1 Billion block of gold thats 30,000 lbs, moving it across the continent is probably a $5 Million, 1,000-hour exercise. 1,000 hours to organize a few 747s, lots of armed guards, lots of diplomatic issues. So $5 Million, 1,000 hours! And if I want to move a $1 Billion block of Bitcoin  $5, 1 hour! A million times cheaper! A thousand times faster right now! And so that means when money progresses from slower to faster, humans are able to create higher frequency structures, and theyre working against space or against friction! So longer-lived structures have to work against time. How am I gonna endow the foundation for 1,000 years? And higher frequency structures are all about, I need to move $1 Billion of gold every 2 hours! Or $1 Billion of money every 2 hours! Not every 2 months. And the gold, of course, is so low frequency  it doesnt oscillate at all, right? I mean, if you have 30,000 lbs of gold, how frequently does it move? I mean, didnt the French send that aircraft carrier to pick up their gold once, in a century?", "image": null}

And its kind of like criticizing someone running a power reactor when youve got a lighter in your hand, you know? Like, its totally unrelated! Its silly! If youre gonna compare the speed and the efficiency of Bitcoin, you have to compare it to the gold network, because you need to have final settlement on $1 Billion of money, of tangible property! And youre not really getting $1 Billion of settlement on a fiat network without so many other things. So I guess my point is: we have something thats gonna last a lot longer  its harder. And then we have something which moves faster, so you create the potential of high-frequency structures which are inconceivable! Like a bank that actually makes $1 Billion loans and moves the money tangibly every day, every hour, every minute! There are certain structures people cant conceive of because they never thought about being able to tangibly move $1 Billion of monetary energy in 37 minutes and then move it back! In the crypto world theyve got this idea of flash loans, maybe thats the closest thing? I dont know how enamored I am of a flash loan that lasts for like 400 milliseconds? I dont know! It seems to me to be interesting but cute  maybe a little bit more gimmicky? I can definitely see the application of a loan that lasts 87 days! Or 31 days! Or maybe moving a block of money for 187 days! If I can do it with two institutional counterparties without the banks in the middle and the governments in the middle  and well get to this in a second, this fiat issue  that opens up a new world! You could imagine in like 1600 in Renaissance Europe, theyre building buildings with masonry and theyre 5 stories high and someone says, You know one day well have steel and were gonna build 100-story skyscrapers and theyll be shaped differently! You know? And the architects couldnt even conceive of that because they didnt have a material strong enough. I dont think people can conceive of the kind of banks or the kind of institutions that well have with high-frequency money! And I think this last issue is that money progresses from dumber to smarter. Humans are able to create more complex structures and theyre working against entropy  complexity? Maybe entropy is the word! So were either working against time  we gotta be harder, were working against space  we gotta be faster, were working against entropy  we gotta be smarter! And the material is the semiconductor chip to make us smarter combined with Bitcoin, and the material is the network to make us faster combined with Bitcoin. I mean Bitcoin is basically sitting on the network on the chip getting harder, faster, smarter, and the conclusion you come to is: just like architecture, where I can break the laws of gravity  what does steel give us? It didnt just give us 50100 story buildings! It also gave us cantilevers and it also gave us bridges, right? And Carnegie made all his money by the way  I read his biography  his big customers were municipalities buying iron and steel for bridges! Bridges are a pretty big deal! Actually, you could make the argument: bridges may be even more important to civilization than skyscrapers! I mean, knock out the bridges in Manhattan and everybody starves to death! You ever see in a bridge  the bridge that connects San Francisco and Oakland, or the Bay bridge that connects the eastern shore of Maryland to D.C.  with the bridge its a 1-hour commute. Without the bridge its a 12-hour commute! Or its an 18-hour drive! In one case I drive to work, in the other case, I dont! Right? It ends the civilization! So I think this element of money  I think you put your finger on something very fascinating, which is: as the money gets harder, we can see further into the future with our institutions! But I think, as it gets smarter and faster, we can construct institutions or relationships that are inconceivable before with slow, soft money! And I would say, that takes us to fiat. Fiat is softer money. Its faster than a block of gold, but its still so much slower and stupider than Bitcoin!", "image": null}

At the end of the day, at least gold is somehow automatic. Its a machine in a sense  it has its own truth within it! You can verify it even though its a little bit expensive. But with fiat its ultimately manual. But todays use, it is generally faster to move it around than moving around physical gold, but its real drawback as you were saying  in holding onto value for the futurethats where its really not good and in that sense, the way that I look at it is: the harder the money, the more it incentivizes us to lower our time preference and therefore makes us think more and more about the future, because the harder the money, the less uncertain the future! Because now you have something thatI have this wealth, this monetary energy that Ive stored  and I have more certainty in the fact that its going to be there in a year or in 23 years. So 1, 2, 3 years becomes more of a foreseeable thing for me, less of a uncertain thing for me, and so I start discounting less! When I start discounting it less, I start effectively lowering my time preference and providing for the future. And this is why I think the harder gotsilver and gold were continuously getting harder and silver was eliminated and gold was hardestthat was the pinnacle of human achievement, arguably! This was when we made the most incredible technology! This was when we invented all these incredible things like the airplane and many, many, many things of the 19th century which I mentioned in The Bitcoin Standard! And I think in the 20th century, maybe weve reversed that process because our money is getting easier and so the future is becoming less certain and so were becoming more high time preference because we discount the future more!", "image": null}

Yeah I think youve put your finger on something there which is: the future gets hazier and you see more anxiety! I mean I know as a corporate CEO, in March  as I was staring at a block of $500 Million US dollars and I was watching the money supply expand and the dollar devalue, my anxiety went through the roof! My anxiety went up so high that it kind of kicked me out of the fiat standard into the Bitcoin standard, right? Like the boiling frog, or jumping out of the boiling whatever! I mean it literally shocked me! Its all about engineering a mechanism or engineering a security for yourself, right? I mean, steel allows me to stand on a cantilevered structure a hundred feet over a canyon! Or it allows me to stand on a bridge 1,000 feet over the Hudson River or the East River with security! I can even drive a car over it and steel allows me to stand 800 feet in the air! And you imagine the insecurity of that, taking the structure away! Human beings are able to go to places with engineering. Space stations, right? Were able to go places with engineering, where otherwise you literally cant live! Like theres no life there without the engineering! You know, you got me thinking about the fiat standard and some of the criticisms Ive heard lately about energy consumption of Bitcoin got me thinking about, Well whats the comparable system? Again the critics are people thatthey have a little toy railroad train in their garage and they think, Well my toy railroad train is more efficient than Bitcoin! But they dont really contrast the energy consumption of Bitcoin to the energy consumption of the alternative system that it is replacing! So if you look at the fiat system, moneys gotta do two things: its gotta be a medium of exchange and a store of value, and Bitcoin kind of is one structure and the fiat is another structure. So I look at the current system and I think, Well to make this work, when we replace the gold standard  I mean the gold standard in its  when commodity money reaches its pinnacle I suppose after all the shuffling around we eventually arrived at gold coins and silver coins! And gold in my opinion is store of value, and silver is the medium of exchange! You know, one of them was the day-to-day currency! A gold coin was like 8 grams, a quarter of an ounce? Feels like its about a $500 coin? And so the gold coin is about 1 weeks salary for a laborer, and you wouldnt have used a $500 or $1,000 coin to pay for things routinely, but if I gave you a stack of ten of them, thats your treasury! So the silver coin is the medium of exchange, and in that standard youve got a very clean structure! Gold coin, silver coin, you mine the gold, you mine the silver, you mint the gold, you mint the silver, you store the gold, you store the silver, they all circulate around! And eventually maybe theyre gold notes, right? Maybe some notes that are fractional or fully reserve-banked  moving that around. [35:51] When we went to the fiat standard, we replaced that withthe Treaty of Genoa got me thinking about this, Saifedean!  we replaced this with diplomats, corporations, accountants, lawyers, programmers, security guards, contractors, buildings, armies, software, mints  we kept the mints, we kept the printers, we kept the gold mines, we kept the vaults, and then we tacked on ideas like ETFs, bond indexes, bond funds, financial managers, and everything else around them, in order to create a medium of exchange and a store of value! Im trying to figure out how much energy is consumed bywhat is it, like 100,000 bank buildings? J.P. Morgan has 200,000 people, so Im guessing there must be in the finance industry around the worldin the US its like 8 Million  so half of the finance industry is tied up in store of value medium of exchange! So if we could figure it out itd probably be like 40 Million people in the world! Maybe its 2040 Million people! So whats the carbon footprint and the building footprint and the concrete footprint and the steel footprint and the electricity consumption of  and I was kind of kind  Im not really allocating all the armies and the like, but you could probably say, if you really wanted to keep track of the real cost of the system ", "image": null}

Thats the primary cost! The secondary cost is all the government infrastructure, the diplomats and the military officials and the aircraft carriers and the armies and the back and forth! I guess the third cost is actually the wars themselves that get waged back and forth! And then I think the fourth cost  the pernicious cost  I guess is the inflation! If were burning  you said 78% was the monetary inflation on average  if theres $500 Trillion of monetary assets and youre debasing 5% of it a year, even, thats $25 Trillion! So I dunno  $50 Trillion a year? It must be $50 Trillion! If we could somehow calculate that number  I mean if you really wanna do something useful  calculate the cost of the infrastructure, the banking infrastructure, then the governmental infrastructure, and then the first order cost of the currency debasement and the second order impact on the currency derivatives  the stocks, the bonds, and the real estate! And then after youve done that you could throw in the business insolvency and the destruction of good enterprises and the political insolvency  destruction of good countries, right? The inefficiency of the system results in the destruction of entire countries! I guess the best example being like the meltdown of the Weimar Republic due to the Treaty of Versailles, which was I think largely the result of poor treatment of debt and, following World War I, I mean they pretty much crashed that entire political system because of the way they layered the debt asymmetrically on the Germans and not on the French and the Americans! We know how that one ended! Which wasnt good for anybody! I think we can see, in the 20th century, we see an example of lots of countries destroyed by the fiat standard. Im sensitive to all the companies destroyed by the fiat standard as well! The example of that is: as they keep cranking up the monetary expansion rate and as CEOs keep attempting to have their stock hold value, the only way the stock can hold value is to expand the cash flows per share faster than the rate of money expansion! And that means that in an environment where the moneys expanding at 7% a year, if your companys growing at 3% a year, you cant store value in the stock, and the political pressure to hold value in the stock causes you to take on massive debt, and then the massive debt is used to either issue dividends or buy the stock back, and so what youre doing is youve taken on $1 Billion of liabilities to actually pump the stock up and then youre impoverishing the company! Eventually you end up with the company having billions of dollars in debt and no equity, and then when you hit a crisis  like a technology crisis like Amazon attacks Toys R Us while they are insolvent  or you have a pandemic crisis and they shut down your restaurant and youre insolvent! So the crises create insolvencies because the companies are undercapitalized because they took on debt under political pressure to keep their stock up! And you could see that playing out even right now, where the majority of CFOs  like we just saw, Im not gonna name the CFOs  but the majority of CEOs and CFOs will say, Were gonna take our cash and buy our stock back, and conventional financial thinking is: Reward CEOs and CFOs for buying stocks back and issuing dividends, and criticize them for buying Bitcoin or tangible assets with their cash flows! Like, I would be criticized as a speculator taking risks with my balance sheet even though today I have $3.2 Billion of tangible assets on my balance sheet! A year ago I had $500 Million, right? And conventional wisdom is, You should give away the $500 Million and have zero! So conventional thinking is: decapitalize the company! And youre really ostracized or criticized if you convert cash from a weak asset to a strong asset! Primarily by conventional thinking. I know I said a lot, and I threw a lot out there but I should pause and we should just talk about it because I think theres a lot of interesting implications and they start with this idea of the fiat system and the fiat standard!", "image": null}

That is great! Thank you for that! The cost of the fiat standard is all the things that you mentioned. Theres also the business cycle which is constantly causing misallocation of capital and causes businesses to make malinvestments which get wiped out all the time! And then theres the fact that  and this is primarily outside the US , its a much bigger problem elsewhere which is that you have the countries pay its balances, all of their international account and their current account, all of it is settled with the central banks cash balance, which is also used to back peoples deposits in the banking system, and it is also used to buy government bonds, so essentially just financing government bonds. [43:41] And it backs the national currency. So youre constantly putting all of societys savings and all of the societys ability to trade with the outside world essentially as collateral for government to borrow against! And of course, government has high time preference incentives to continue to abuse this all the time, and so it ends up creating all kinds of destruction of savings and destruction of capital. I think thats really  well its hard to estimate which is the biggest  but if you think about a century of misallocation of capital, when you think about, How much capital was misallocated? And, How much capital was essentially leaked away from prudent, productive people who have put it away to finance their future and then suddenly saw it go Poof! because their central bank had printed it! And all of that went to finance wasteful government spending and war and investment in things that were not chosen on the market! If you think about the opportunity cost of that over a century, I think the world would be a very different place! And I dont necessarily have to speculate about technological achievements that we havent made, but I think with the things that we have, owning a house with 24-hour electricity and running water is probably something that would be attainable for everybody in the world if money was hard! If you think about it, anybody, particularly people in the poorest country in the world, if they had had gold for the last century, it would be almost trivial for people to be able to secure a modern house with electricity and running hot water as a basic infrastructure! I think the upside of where we would be is almost unimaginable for people in our position! [45:29] But I think the bare minimum would be that: basic technology would be far cheaper all over the world and far more easily available because people could afford them! Its not that expensive to build an engine that gives you 24-hour electricity! Its a really simple engineering problem thats been solved in many places in the world for many many decades. And it just keeps getting cheaper every year! I think the reason that so many people in the world dont have it is because they have bad money that just continues to lose value. And it ruins their time preference as we were saying earlier! It prevents them from thinking of the future.", "image": null}

As I read The Fiat Standard, I see we kind of had to abandon the gold standard because we needed faster money and we needed larger quantities of it! You know, we replaced the gold standard with this network of tens of thousands of banks and hundreds of central banks and armies of accountants and lawyers and bureaucrats! The currency was the medium of exchange, the store of value when the fiat system worked  first they tried the store of value as gold  it seems like they layered on fiat currency over gold to try to do that, and then over time as the gold got seized and it was synthetic gold or hypothecated gold, and then in 1971 the semblance of that started breaking down and then the store of value in the fiat system was sovereign debt! If we look at the world today, theres all the currency, and the theoretical store of value, right? If you ask a corporate treasurer, What are you gonna do with your treasury, I need to store my value? Well I dont hold my cash outright, I would hold it in government debt  treasuries were the gold. The gold standard is treasuries! And that kind of worked! For example, the currency system  international currency trading  used to kind of work! There was price discovery in the market! For example, you remember when Greek debt was trading like 8, 9, 10%, and I remember Spanish debt or Italian debt used to trade 56%. I would say if you go back to before the EU was formed and you had all these countries with all their different currencies, the currencies were in a competitive market, and if a country wanted to keep its currency from collapsing, you had to raise the interest rate! So you remember when people used to have 12% interest rates and 8%  under the Volcker regime, we go back to the 80s: you had Ronald Reagan  he was fairly conservative, Volcker was conservative. There you had the fiat standard, but they took the interest rates to 18% in the US! The thinking was, countries had to compete to make the currency viable: you had to have interest rates that were market-set, and in that world you have 8% 30-year bonds and you had 5% bonds. In 2010, short-term interest rates were 5%! So you remember you were saying, Well the money supply was expanding at 78%, maybe 7% or something! In that world, if Im a corporate treasurer, I can get 56% on bonds. Call it credit-worthy bonds, AAA credit. The store of value in the fiat system, when it works  and well go back to good ole days, Ronald Reagan when it was the good ole days  when it works you buy credit-grade bonds, AAA-rated, you buy sovereign debt, it yields 4, 5, 6%, the money supply expands either 3% or 7%, say its expanding at 78%, youre getting a 12% loss, I give you $100 Million  the half-life of the money is 35 years! So in that world, you can have  by the way, 35 years or 30 years is kind of a magic number, its your career, Saifedean  so if Im a CEO or Im a corporate treasurer and Im running on the fiat standard in that time period, I can take my capital, I can put it into like credit-worthy bonds, not take a lot of execution risk, not try to guess what happens with Zoom versus Tesla and Im not speculating, right? The fiat standard, when it works, gives you sovereign debt and credit instruments that allow me as a responsible corporate treasurer to protect the assets of the company for the next 2030 years, long enough for the company to execute its business strategy. That used to work! But then something started breaking down in the last 30 years! And today its busted! Theres no price discovery, sovereign debt is not a store of value! Last week the junk bond index dipped below 5%, it was 4.9%! Okay? The theoretical risk of junk bonds, the risk of default to anybody is 4%, but to a rational person it feels like its 8%! Its 48%, is the risk on the bond, which means that if youre getting 4% yield, youre at best zero and at worst, its a negative real yield of 4% or something after credit adjustment! So that tells you that corporate bonds, sovereign debt, and junk bonds are no longer stores of value. And the currencies yield no interest! The US 30-year swap was 72 basis points a year ago. Today, its 175180 basis points! And thats the best youre gonna get! [51:34] The EU 30-year swap is 20 basis points. Its nothing! Theres no yield! So what can you say? You can say: the fiat standard has broken down starting the year 2020, because at this point there is no tangible store of value where all the traditional treasury instruments are no longer stores of value! Now, when did it start? And Im going over this in my head  forgive me, I read your book, you got me thinking, Im literally thinking about this this morning but Im thinking  Im thinking it started to break down with the Japanese in 1980s. I think the Japanese had a crisis, the crisis was: the digital revolution, computer chip came out, Intel, Microsoft  the Japanese dominate analog electronics, the world shifts to digital electronics, their exports start slipping, and as the world moves to the Computer Age, the Japanese economy weakens. Their reaction is: the central bank starts to intervene. Theyre a closed system and authoritarian, a single government in a closed system under economic crisis. And so they start buying everything, price discovery disappears, asset inflation goes through the roof, real estate in Tokyo goes through the roof, zombie companies start to manifest themselves, the economy freezes! And thats the first place you start to see the breakdown of the fiat standard! The interest rate goes to laughable numbers! Non-competitive, and its like this self-referential closed system  it doesnt make any sense whatsoever! And America looks at it and in America we have 18% interest rates, you know? And so the Japanese response was central bank intervention, and they were the first major country. Maybe not the first, because Im not a student of China and every other country. I just noticed in Japan. Then what happens next, America has the Reagan revolution and so Reagan and Volcker really define the game plan until 1988. And we have the fiat system lurching toward normal  you had savings accounts that yield 6, 7, 8% interest! You know, the way you know that theres a semblance of normalcy is: checking accounts yield 0% and savings accounts yield 8% interest and the banking system offers those things! You know, a savings account allows me to save money! If the money supplys debasing at 7% a year, the savings account is yielding 7% interest, theres some hope! When I was a kid, there was hope! And then Clinton came in and Clinton inherited a great economy and Microsofts killing it and theres the Internet revolution and Google and Apple  this is the rise of America and all of a sudden we thought the Japanese were gonna own everything in America! They were buying the Rockefeller Center, Sony was crushing everybody, etc. So we lurched in 1980, an inflection point! America got its mojo back and we thought technology and the Internet  that makes us leaders! We didnt think we were world economic leaders when Reagan was elected! I mean, people really thought the Japanese, they were setting up Toyota plants, theres a movie Gung Ho  we thought we were gonna be working for the Japanese! [54:54] The world took a left turn, the Japanese economy missed the digital revolution, and I think this is deep-seated in the Japanese language. Its a pictographic language, that they didnt have the programming skills. They missed the digital revolution! America started to rise, the rise of Western Europe, the US started to prosper from digital productivity. And Clinton inherited this very healthy economy from Reagan, and Clinton was kind of a moderate. And we went on to 2000. And what happens in 2000? The EU! And before the EU you had all these different currencies and when you crossed Europe, every currency had to have its own interest rate and its own bank, and theyre competitive with each other! And if a currency prints too much, their currency crashes and no ones gonna save them! And so there are interest rates! Go look at the interest rates  theyre real interest rates! It was like a 7%, a 6%, an 8%! Right? There are consequences to irrationality under the fiat standard when theres 100 central banks and theyre all competing! And you talked about it in your book: theres all these central banks! The US as a currency swap was  it wasnt 87% or 90% of all currency  it was like 30%! You can see this manifest itself in 1980, because when you had different currency systems  the Chinese, the Japanese, the Indian, South America, the German bank, the U.K., the French, the US  theyre all different currency systems. And the US had to raise their interest rates, and there are consequences to our inflation! We had to take our interest rates to 1819% to actually fix that problem! We couldnt print money with impunity! Its like pissing in your own bath tub! Its a small bath tub, and there are consequences to foiling your own bath tub, but when its a big ocean, there are no consequences and you feel like you can  if you print $1 Trillion in a $10 Trillion economy thats a problem. And if you print $1 Trillion in a $50 Trillion global economy thats 2%, right? That just goes away! So in 1980, you couldnt do it! And we started lurching toward globalism, and then the EU was this big change! And what happened? Well the EU came with a light hand, but it was a massive increase in governmental authority and fiat authority. Because now youve got an EU central bank! In my opinion, the biggest beneficiary of the EU? When the EU formed, the biggest beneficiary was the US! Because you saw every local country ", "image": null}

When you travel through Europe after the formation of the EU, all the menus converted to English, EU adopted English as the second language, you converted to the Euro, and if youre living in Portugal or France or Spain youre thinking, Well I had to give up Portuguese and Spanish and Italian for English! And I had to give up the peseta and the lira for the Euro, but I might as well just convert it to the dollar! The Italians arent gonna adopt French! And so its almost like all the Europeans agreed to adopt English, and then they started pegging to the dollar! And the US was the big beneficiary of the formation of the EU, because now everybody had to accept English and the dollar, and that played into TCP/IP and the Internet, and Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and the entire US economy benefited! And it was US San Francisco progressive views, San Francisco technology, US law. The American legal and economic and cultural system encroached on Europe in a big way! We saw the formation of a Western Europe and the United States, a billion-person trading bloc trading in dollars, convertible dollars trading in English language subject to basically US trade law! So what happened next? Well, the EU was weak, and there was a crisis, and it used to be that, if I wanted to buy Italian bonds I could get 78% yield, and the German bond yield was 2%. And the Germans had the best credit rating and the French were next, but the Portuguese had a weaker one and the Italians had an awful credit rating and their bonds yielded great! And the Greeks, at some point  you could probably go back and pull the bond yields, it probably tells the story of the death of the fiat standard, right? Or the encroachment of the fiat standard! If you look at bond yields in European countries from 2000-on, theres a point at which they all pretty much pegged to the EU bond yield, and that was as the EU central banks started taking responsibility for the default of the Greeks. The Greek crisis was probably a seminal event! [1:00:56] When the EU bailed out Greece, that was an expansion of the EU central bank! I almost think about two crises: we had the Great Financial Crisis, when the United States bailed out every bank, and we forced them all to take hundreds of billions of dollars, and we bailed out every European bank with US dollars! And it seems like once we did that, we owned them all! Like, the US dollar as the world reserve currency, it went from being 30% to 40% to 60% to 80% to 90% after that crisis! And it seems like after the debt crisis of Greece, and after the Italian debt crisis when the EU central bank bailed out those countries, the EU kind of owned them as well! The summary is: by the time this is all said and done, interest rates in the European Union have crashed to zero, short-term interest rates are negative, long-term interest rates were like 8 basis points for 30-year money on a swap a few weeks ago! And so what you really got is the massive expansion of the EU central bank and the Fed from the year 2000 to the year 2020. And as they expanded, all corporate debt, all sovereign debt, stopped being an effective store of value! The currencies became dominant and for whatever reason, the US currency just got progressively stronger and stronger from 1980 to the year 2020! And now the entire transformation has taken its hold!", "image": null}

Theyre actually charging like  theyre offering 15 basis points yield and charging 25 basis points management fee! The literal fee is higher than the yield on the account! The marketplace has migrated, and its being forced. And stage one was gold, stage two was sovereign debt, and then the rise of corporate, AAA-rated debt. You could almost say that in order to replace the gold standard, we had to have an army of credit rating agencies  Moodys and S&P and you could say the rise of the junk bond market might be explained by this!  people desperately chasing after store of value without equity risk. Finally they threw in the towel and they started absorbing some equity risk! And then in 2020, we kind of kicked the thing into high gear, right? March of 2020 is the point where everything just breaks! Like, because 5, 6, 7% money expansion against an 8% S&P index and against a 5% bond yield or 4% credit worthy yield and 810% junk bond yield  you can sort of almost make that work, but it stops working when the money supply expands by 25% and the S&P yield is 15% and the junk bond yield is 4%, and the sovereign yield is 01%!", "image": null}

I think that whats happened is, people have migrated, smart money has determined that theres only two stores of value left! Really smart money thats brave says, Bitcoin! If youre really progressive and if youve got some courage, then you realize that the best store of value is Bitcoin  its digital gold! The other layer of smart money that is either very comfortable  theyre already wealthy, theyve got plenty of money and theyre comfortable or theyre conventional  the comfortable, conventional smart money has decided that Big Tech or growth is the store of value. And the best surrogate for that is NASDAQ. If I go right now case for Bitcoin, and I look, what does that show me? ROI 1-year its saying Bitcoin is 356% up, NASDAQ is up 43%, gold is up 14.7%, S&P is up 16%, and treasuries are 2%, and your money expansion was 25% or whatever you want to plug in! And if you plug in 15% going forward you can see youll tread water with gold and S&P  maybe! I wouldnt [with gold]! I think that youre more likely to tread water with the S&P. I think with gold, gold is in a ballistic trajectory  it got a boost in the crisis  now its losing momentum, its broken down in the last 6 months and its about to crash! And youre going to see people short gold, reallocate from gold, the price is gonna crash! And its probably the scariest possible investment right now, because gold only exists as long as people are looking for a non-sovereign store of value, and you only need one, right? And theres only one that can be! And you pretty much have to be brain-dead to be allocating to gold versus Bitcoin in the year 2021! Youre just gonna have to go through like mental gymnastics! So I can buy the argument that I buy a market basket of all the stocks, because youre just buying the economy, but I cant really buy the argument of gold anymore! And of course, treasuries are disasters because youre long money  not only are you taking on cash thats losing 15% of its purchasing power a year, youre locking yourself in for 2030 year duration! By the time you get the cash back youre going to have lost 95% of your money, so thats just foolish! But youve got growth, right? Everybody wants growth! Theyll take growth discounting risk to zero! Theyll even take the prospect of growth, right? Like if you just tell me a story, and if I cant have growth then theyll buy GameStop because at least theres the potential of  if I cant have growth, Ill take speculation of growth, and if I cant have speculation of growth, Ill just take speculation of a short squeeze! All of those are more compelling than anything left in the fiat system!", "image": null}

And I think Bitcoin becomes more and more compelling over time. Sure, there will definitely be stocks and investing in stocks has its place, but I think for the store of value market, thats going to distinct from money that you want to risk on high growth, high risk stocks! So the interesting thing will be to see how this develops! Now youve been saying that you dont think Bitcoin threatens the dollar. So would you say that Bitcoin threatens treasuries, but doesnt threaten the dollar and therefore we can continue to see maybe just more inflation in the dollar, but governments continue turning value against Bitcoin and continue to collect taxes from Bitcoin, so Bitcoin replaces their treasuries, puts them on a tight leash, and makes their inflation a little bit more transparent, but their dollar continues to survive! Is that how you see it?", "image": null}

Its a crypto-anarchist idea! I could be more supportive of Bitcoin replacing the Zimbabwe dollar, or the Venezuelan Bolivar! Like, in a government where all of the institutions of government have broken down, an utterly corrupt, dysfunctional government where they cant function anymore, and thats a hyper-inflationary environment  Id probably be more supportive of that! Because there, people are going to starve to death! So theres billions of people in collapsing economies where the currency is collapsing. There, some kind of stable currency  it might be even a stablecoin like the US dollar sitting on a crypto-rail backed by Bitcoin, which might be what Tether is or what something is  I think that thats probably got a value, thats probably got a place! But in the United States and in Europe, as the fiat currency expands, it maintains its place as a medium of exchange and a lawful currency and as legal currency. And it will, and we should hope it will, because I dont think anybody wants France or Germany or the US to look like Zimbabwe, right? I mean those are literally countries where the rule of law and the right to property break down! When the rule of law and your right to freedom of speech or the right to life, liberty, and property break down, youve got a situation of true anarchy! And then  I suppose if youre a crypto-anarchist and you support reinstalling free speech and right to property via a crypto network  I get that! That makes sense! But in a country that has a rule of law and a right to property, the logical thing that happens is, when people lose faith in the currency, they migrate to gold! When gold isnt fast enough  by the way, gold is an antiquated, elitist asset! I mean, the criticism of gold that people should focus on is that its elitist! How do 500 million people buy $1,700 worth of gold? Calculate: what is the mark up on $1,700 worth of gold coins purchased $87 at a time, right? Isnt that like 40% mark up? Like, arent you looking at  I mean elitist is, Im gonna basically pay double! I mean even coins are expensive! If you want to get gold at a reasonable price you have to buy a bar of London good delivery gold, which is 400 ounces at a time  thats $800,000 blocks of goldand you probably have to buy five of them from J.P. Morgan to get treated anywhere close to reasonably, right? So gold is an elitist store of value. It is not accessible to the billion people in the Western world  in Western Europe and the US! Its certainly not accessible to the 7.8 Billion people on the planet! And so, if youre going to deliver a store of value to everybody with a mobile phone on Earth, Bitcoin is your best bet! Bitcoin is gonna be running transaction fees of less than 1%. 12% would be high, you know? Whatever it is, its going to be nothing compared to the cost to acquire and store and maneuver gold! Gold is elitist and gold is antiquated, because I cant move $37 worth of gold from point A to point B to pay for an Uber ride! I cant fund with gold! Gold is not bankable! Gold is slow money. With Bitcoin, were on the verge of a world where youll have $1 Trillion of Bitcoinyou can plug a billion consumer accounts into it and you can offer people the ability to borrow against the Bitcoin at 4% interest! J.P. Morgan offers you securitized loans up to loan-to-value 50% against conventional assets at LIBOR +50 basis points if youre an institutional customer! You could get LIBOR +200 basis points if you were a consumer! Youre talking about 23% interest! So in a world where a major bank were to plug into Bitcoin, theres no reason why we couldnt get to a point where a billion people could borrow money against Bitcoin at 2% and then never sell the Bitcoin forever! I think in the next 36 months well see 45% consumer loans against Bitcoin! Whens the last time you got a loan against gold? No! And then were onto this next thing which is, Okay, well write off gold. Well whats next? Bond indexes? No. So we migrate to stock indexes! I think the free market in the Western world is inventing asset classes to serve as stores of value, and theyve been doing them legally and ethically, and the government allows you to create asset classes! I mean, when $1 Trillion moved into the Vanguard 500, the S&P 500, the government didnt block that! So I think that the right way to think about it is: Bitcoin as a store of value asset class, as digital gold, growing to be $10 Trillion, and then $20 Trillion and then $40 Trillion. The big model I have is a monetary planet. And lets say the monetary planet is $500 Trillion, its a gaseous planet! The outside of it is $100 Trillion worth of M2 or M3 money  currency, derivatives and the like  Euros, Dollars, etc. And so thats currency thats moving through all the governments on Earth, and thats gonna continue as long as there are governments on Earth! Then inside of that is $400 Trillion worth of other assets, and its broken up between real estate and collectibles and stocks and credit instruments and bonds and derivatives. $350 Trillion of the $400 Trillion  I dunno, maybe its not that  maybe $200 Trillion of the $400 Trillion is what Ill call currency derivatives! Their value is based substantially or in part on the discounted value of the future cash flows of the asset. So stocks valued on future cash flows, commercial real estates valued on future cash flows, and bonds valued on future cash flows. Those are currency derivatives. Now inside that is a higher quality set of assets  Im gonna call them trophy assets, collectible assets! A beach house in the Hamptons, Palm Beach, a Picasso  even a trophy equity, to the extent that own Disney because I love Disney, because I love Mickey Mouse, because Mickey Mouse was part of my formative experiences! A trophy piece of debt, its a piece of debt for the Childrens Hospital in my neighborhood because they saved my kids life. Like something that you would hold and you would value because its part of your self-identity! A football team, a soccer franchise  things that people love and they would hold them irregardless of the forecast of the discounted cash flows into the future. Your personal home  your personal home has value to you, your personal car, your personal yacht, your personal plane! These things have value to you because you love them and they will be pried from your cold, dead fingers! And it doesnt matter what the interest rate is  its your house! Its your lake house! So that stuff is a harder asset. And then in the middle of that is a $10 Trillion hardcore gold which well call non-sovereign store of value fungible money. And inside that, in this burning red-hot thing at the center of the Earth  thats crypto! Theres a Trillion-dollar crypto fire in the middle of the $500 Trillion planet! And that Trillion-dollar crypto fire was started from a spark by Satoshi, and its burning and it went from a Billion to $10 Billion to $100 Billion to a Trillion  the Bitcoin fire! And that is the hardest, fastest, smartest, strongest monetary asset in the history of the human race! And it is expanding and it is boiling these things, and it is boiling gold! And the first thing its gonna do is its gonna replace gold, and gold will collapse into the crypto fire! And then it will suck in sovereign credit instruments, negative-yielding sovereign debt, to the extent that thats held as a store of value! It will subsume some debt indexes and some equity indexes. And itll probably expand from $10 Trillion to $20 to $40, $80, $100 Trillion, and it could get all the way to say $200 Trillion, and when its $200 Trillion, itll be the stabilizing framework and the gaseous monetary planet will go from $500 Trillion up by 10% to $550, maybe its +15% a year, right? If its +15% a year, your $500 Trillion monetary planet will expand to become an $800-$900 Trillion  whats after a trillion, is it a quad ", "image": null}

And Bitcoin will expand at 250%-300% a yearfor the last decade  and thats about as fast as it can go, because anything faster than that rips the wings off the airplane! People ask, How fast can human beings accept change? I think, if you look at the history of business, companies growing faster than 200% a year are rare! I mean, thats pretty much as fast as it can go! So itll go 200%, and itll track that way, and then I think at some point when it crosses gold, itll slow down to 150% and 120%  you could probably work it out over the next 20 years as it goes from a Trillion to $200 Trillion! It might take 30 years. It might take 20 years. It might take 10 years. Somewhere between 1030 years, right? If you look at the rate. And where were headed is: a world where theres 8 billion people on the planet with a mobile phone, and those 8 billion people are storing value in digital gold, and probably that mobile device is gonna have a hardware wallet embedded in it thats gonna be the token, and youll have multi-signature multi-hardware wallets securing digital gold which has become  I dunno what is it gonna be, a third, or half?  you have to ask the question theoretically, Saifedean! What portion of the monetary planet should rationally be store of value? And I think its self-equibilating, because as more monetary energy  its like magnetism, youre de-magnetizing something, youre de-monetizing something!  as more monetary energy falls off of gold and off of silver and then off of indexes into Bitcoin, price discovery will return to these other assets! So price discoverys gonna return to gold and its gonna return to its ornamental and antique value! And price discovery will return to silver, and price discovery will return to stocks and bonds. What you can assume is that in a free market, price discovery will return, the bond prices will fall, the yields will increase, real estate prices will fall, the yields will increase for commercial real estate, you will see stock prices fall, dividend yields and yields will increase  everything will rationalize in a free market. Market dynamics, conventional market theory dictates that: no asset can be any more attractive than any other asset in a free market, because capital will flow and migrate so as to equalize the expected return on all assets! Now what youre gonna see is certain markets become not free! The way you break that is you pass laws! The extreme cases will what youre seeing going on in India right now. What you saw in China makes it impossible to convert your RMB into Bitcoin. And Indias threatened by it, Nigerias threatened by it. Youre gonna see back and forth, and youll see some countries will embrace it and other countries will run from it! But you know, the Chinese made Google, Twitters illegal, Facebooks illegal, right? Thats gonna happen! And it didnt stop them from being successful other places! I think youll probably see the Western world will embrace digital gold, I think youll see banana republics, corrupt regimes, attempt to resist it! On the other hand, Ive traveled all through China and everybodys got a VPN and theyre looking at Twitter and Facebook accounts with VPNs! Its really difficult  can they actually stop it? Not really, right? I mean they cant stop it, they actually have a hard time stopping money traveling on crypto rails over VPNs and the TOR network. On the other hand, will they suffer from it? Yeah! Theres a big cost to not have Google! I mean theres a big cost to not have YouTube, right? Theres a big cost to not have electricity! Theres costs to reject technology! If your money moves a million times faster, then that means the cost of capital for the world that embraces the technology drops, and that means that innovation accelerates! And you can cling to your gold coins and your giant stone coins of the Yap people and whatever, but at some point  theres a cost not having Google Maps, man! Cars that dont drive themselves, you know? Theres a cost! And eventually it reflects itself in the Cuba standard of living, or the North Korean standard of living, and even the Chinese cant necessarily stop this thing! So bottom line is: I think the fiat system is going to continue as a currency, and it should! The currency rails work fine! What people still havent got through their head is, I could have 150% of my assets in Bitcoin! You can have a million dollars, you can buy $1 Million in Bitcoin, you can mortgage your house, buy another $500,000 in Bitcoin, you could take out a personal loan against your future earnings if youre a doctor  buy another $500k in Bitcoin! If it was me, Id mortgage my house, Id sell my gold, and I would raise debt and I would buy Bitcoin! You can have 100% of your assets in Bitcoin, get a bank that will give you a loan against Bitcoin, if Bitcoin is going up at 25% a year, and if your expenses are going up at 5% a year, you can borrow money to pay for your coffee and to pay your rent and to drive your car and to live your life forever! never pay it back  keep the Bitcoin, and your debt-to-equity ratio will fall! And so at some point you could literally fund everything in Bitcoin, and so you dont need to replace the dollar is my point! You dont really want to spend Bitcoin! What you want to do, is you want to plug your Bitcoin account into a Visa card, and you want to pay for things with Visa, and you want to run up a debt, and you never want to pay it off, and you want to die owing money! Its not that complicated! You have a million dollars and it doubles every year  you eventually have $100 Million, you can spend $100,000 a year going up at 20% a year, or you can spend $100,000 going up at 50% a year, and you will die with $90 Million of equity, $10 Million in debt, never having paid tax! And you dont need to replace the Euro, you dont need to replace the dollar, you dont need to get rid of your Visa card, right? Those things dont matter!", "image": null}

People dont get into as much debt, and fewer dollars are created. And so if people are holding Bitcoin instead of holding debt instruments on their balance sheet then less debt takes places, and the key concept in The Fiat Standard is that fiat is debt. So basically Bitcoin reduces the demand and the supply for fiat! But I guess its unfortunately its not a choice we get to make, its an outcome of markets. So the question is: Can the dollar hold on? And can printing the dollar manage to maintain the Bitcoin storm? I guess thats what well see! But there are reasons why we can see Bitcoin continue to grow without the dollar having to collapse. Ive got another question for you, switching gears a little bit: you waltzed into the Bitcoin world at a very very good time, you know! You came in at what was it $7, $8, $9,000, and within a couple of weeks we are now almost at $50,000  its at $47,000 I think right now. Obviously part of that is probably you and the impact that you have had  all the evangelism that youve done! But also, weve had periods in Bitcoin before where prices have declined for quite a while, so if this was high school, you would be signing up for high school the week of the prom and the graduation! You didnt sit with us through the dark days of holding the  buying the $1,000 top and watching it go down to $150 over two years! So Im wondering: you went in at a time where this was a possibility! We could have had another two years, you know? You may have chanced upon Bitcoin in 2018 and Bitcoin hasnt changed much between 2018 and 2020, but if you bought in March 2018 you wouldve witnessed the decline for quite a while! So Im wondering, was your entry, were you just thinking, Alright, this is now better technology  Im just gonna be buying as much as I can! Or was there some kind of price analysis going on in a sense of, Weve consolidated for a while, so most likely were gonna be getting another jump! Would you have bought as aggressively in 2018? And do you follow any particular models for thinking about the price?", "image": null}

Second, I think the best time in human history to buy Bitcoin was starting in March of 2020! If you want to look at this entire thingstarting from March of 2020 the world changed forever! That was the risk/reward point where the risk had diminished by 99%, and the return and the use case had amped by a factor of 100! It was an inflection point in March of 2020! Look, I wouldnt have bought it at all in February of 2020! I didnt know it existed  I didnt really care to think about it! The world was totally different in February versus in April, so I think March is the beginning of the new era. I think that people in the Bitcoin industry, I think to a certain degree, theyre biased by their history, and its a liability for them. I think its baggage that they should lose! I think that most people in the Bitcoin industry  most people in business, most people in life, they want to draw on their experience, because theres a bias that, I want to make decisions based on my experience, and I want to feel that everything that I experienced was worthwhile! And if I felt pain, I would like for it to have meant something, right? So what if I looked at you and I said, Saif, nothing that you experienced between 20102020 was relevant! And you could basically flush it all down the toilet and take a clean sheet of paper and start again! That doesnt feel good! Right? Psychologically its hard to let go of that, but let me give you an example of inflection point: for 10 years before March [2020], we had tried to use video conferencing and I used Webex. And my experiences were uniformly awful for the entire 10 years! I could probably write a book on all of the bad meetings and all of the awful dysfunctional business results that came from that, and I fired people that wanted to use video conferencing and wanted to work remotely the previous year! Okay? And I had lots of experience! And then in March we decided to use Zoom and Zoom was 100x better, and I had only good experiences! And the truth of the matter is, the entire decade of experience that I had with video conferencing was of no value whatsoever! It actually just saddled me with a prejudicial bias because I had scars and I had pain, and its all irrelevant! So after March, everybody on Earth needed Bitcoin! 1,000 companies! You heard Ross last week, he said, I had 20 clients at the beginning of the year, I had 280 institutional clients at the end of the year, I have 90 in the pipeline now. Ross will have 1,000 clients! Hell go from 20 to 1,000! All of his experience before March, all of your forecasts before March  irrelevant! Its what I said to Keith McCullough, All your models  destroyed! Why are they destroyed? Because theyre based upon the statistical interaction. A tidal wave hits the beach! Okay? I drop a bomb on your head! Your entire history living in the town or playing on the beach  irrelevant! Irrelevant! You want it to matter  it doesnt matter! When $100 Trillion of capital comes through a nozzle  it doesnt matter! If you took every trade of Bitcoin from the point that Satoshi did the whatever and the pizza transfer took place, all the way through the blow-off top, all of it is irrelevant! Let me explain it a different way: if Elon Musk woke up tomorrow and decided, Screw it! Im buying $10 Billion of Bitcoin instead of $1.5 Billion of Bitcoin! That one decision renders irrelevant all of the studying of Bitcoins trajectory between today and last March! One person, one thing, makes a difference! And likewise, March rendered irrelevant the statistical models in the history before! Whats going on right now is, on February 8th, on Monday, the day that you woke up, if you read the news, the world changed again! You have to keep redoing your models! The human race, I mean  read Paleo-theory: we ran around getting chased by wolves and apes for 34 Million years, starving to death! Life was difficult! And 10,000 years ago we invented agriculture  life changed again! 100 years ago  life changed again! The life of a human being today: the challenges, the dynamics  how many children get up and worry about getting eaten by a wild animal today? Its irrelevant, right? The history of the human race is irrelevant to a decision  like, youre gonna get in a car and drive the car? You can kill yourself in 3 seconds! What matters is, youre in the frickin car! When you engineer a new system, it completely renders irrelevant your history! If I take a gun and I point it at your headand theres a bullet in it  nothing in the world that youve lived through matters other than: can you get me to not pull the trigger? Everything else is irrelevant! And so, engineering machines, and when your circumstances change  when youre skiing down a ski-slope and theres an avalanche, all your skill as a skier  rendered irrelevant! All your skill as a human being! Its back to this issue of the guy that was the chairman of HNA  he was the richest guy in China, worth $30 Billion! 2 years ago? He went hiking in the South of France, stood on a rock wall, had a selfie taken, tripped and fell to his death! All of his money, all of his models, all of his lawyers, 87 Million frickin people in China  irrelevant! In 1 second, he broke the law of gravity and he died! The point here is: Bitcoin has moved into a different zone, a phase shift! It was in one phase from 20102015, it went through another phase 20152018. When Bitcoin pulled ahead after the fork wars it moved into a different phase. And then in 2020 it moved into a different phase. And at the point that publicly traded companies started buying it and institutions started buying it and mainstream media started coping with it, when a Senator got elected, the mayor of Miami Beach, Senator Cynthia Lummis  when these things happen, when Gary Gensler takes his role at the SEC  youre in a different phase! And so, you have to recalibrate all of your models based upon a whole new set of assumptions. And its like I took the spear out of your hand, I gave you a bow and arrow! The human race changed! I take your bow and arrow out of your hand, I gave you a gun! I take the gun out of your hand and I give you a bomb! As I change the engineering, the outlook changes and you cannot draw on your history anymore! You have to think differently!", "image": null}

Its been doing 1 block every 10 minutes for the past 12 years throughout all of these phases! And Bitcoins volatility and market dynamics have not changed much! Weve gotten these big bull runs after the halvings every single time. So far, its extraordinary what has happened in Bitcoin over the last year, but it isnt extraordinary by the standards of Bitcoin  its happened before! So the question is: will this time be different, do you think? Have we moved into something fundamentally different after 2020 or would we still see a market cycle similar to what we had before?", "image": null}

So, Fidelity is a Bitcoin bank, Coinbase is a Bitcoin bank, Binance didnt exist 4 years agoits a Bitcoin bank. The CME is a Bitcoin bank, PayPal and Square are Bitcoin banks, Microstrategy and Greyscale are Bitcoin banks! Those are radically different things! Probably PayPal and Square will, between the two of them, they will sell Bitcoin to  what do you think, 2030 million people this year? The holders of Bitcoin have changed, the investment communities have changed, the narratives changed, the use case has changed, the way that people buy it has changed, and the technology to buy it  for example, I buy $200 Million of it, I do it with 88,000 transactions, every 3 seconds buying Bitcoin $2,000 a second! And I buy it to hold it forever! Thats change! Look at all the Bitcoin that Greyscale bought  its locked up in a trust! Do you know how that will be sold?", "image": null}

It isnt possible to sell it, Saifedean! There is no mechanism to sell it! The construction of the trust is such that, when the money flows into the trust, they buy Bitcoin, there are GBTC shares that are issued. Those shares can be sold and the price of the shares  the derivatives can go down  the underlying Bitcoin can never be sold per the charter! Ever! Ever! So you see, there are fundamental different things that are going on! Last I checked they had $30 Billion of Bitcoin. Thats $30 Billion of Bitcoin that cant be sold! Okay? Held by institutions! A very different world! So these are sources of inertia falling into Bitcoin. And the volatility is not the same! If you look at the drawdowns, theyre not the same. Like when Bitcoin ran up to $40,000 it traded by down to $30,000  that was a 25% retracement. Not an 80% retracement!", "image": null}

I do! Let me say it a different way: if youre a Boy Scout and youre shivering in the freezing cold and youre attempting to start a fire for the first time, you recall how difficult it is to start a fire and then you recall going to sleep without a fire and then maybe your friend froze to death and youre mortified by it! But then one day you grow up and you have a furnace in your house, or maybe you plug into someone elses electrical system and you have an electrical heater  youre not a Boy Scout anymore! Right? Its a totally different world, and the system, the network, is much more mature, its just much better engineered, theres much more monetary energy in it, theres much more inertia. I mean ultimately, theres massive amounts of monetary inertia in the system! Its like an air compressor. Were compressing energy in a monetary battery and its accelerating if you look at the rate at which energy is flowing into it! And as that energy flows, its stabilizing! So the more monetary energy flowing in the system, the more stable it is, the more inertia it is, the more difficult it is to change the direction, and the less volatility it has! And I think that youre gonna continue to see that as these banks evolve! Its very clear to me ever since March, you can literally see the volatility and the instability in the entire network being damped by rational actors!", "image": null}

So for the price to hold around that level, we had to have $14 Million of new demand a day. Now, theres only so much more the demand can increase! There will come a point in which the demand goes up, and so the price goes up, and then the price of the new coins thatll be mined is also going up massively, so then the new supply becomes bigger than the demand  the demand cant keep up with the supply, and you witness an inflection because theres also a lot of leverage! A lot of people that are leveraged in so they get wiped out and then the technicals of the chart turn, and then we can have another big drawdown! What do you think?", "image": null}

Again I think that all of these models are mental models that were formed in the early years, and I think that you should throw them all out! And you should start to reason from first principles and build a new model! For example: Im staring at the screen of Binance right now! The 24-hour volume of BTC is 93,000 coins on Binance. If you double it, that means theres probably 180,000 coins traded today! 900 Bitcoin is irrelevant! The amount of Bitcoin being created is so de minimis compared to the volume of the trading, its irrelevant! And also, I think its irrelevant to any rational investor! Its just irrelevant to me! For example: theres 21 Million fully-diluted Bitcoins! Done! End of Story! Like, I dont care at what point they get printed because  again, whats the ratio of 93,000 to 900? The amount of Bitcoin getting mined is 50 basis points! Its half of a percent! Like when were doing a trade, we pay half a percent as the fee! Like, people with serious amounts of money  theyre gonna blow through this! They dont care! What matters a lot more than all of these concerns about the halving is if Paul Tudor Jones wakes up and decides to double his allocation from 1% to 2%? Or from 2% to 4%? That matters more than all of these other things, because the demand is excessive! So I think a better way to look at it is, its emerging as an asset class like the S&P 500 index. And when it gets to be $10 Trillion or $5 Trillion or $3 Trillion just like the index, theres so much money coming in and going out of it that its stabilizing the index, and it takes  if youve got a $10 Trillion asset class like gold, it would take a Trillion dollars! Why do you think I didnt buy gold? Its because I said, Well its gonna take $20 Trillion to drive gold up by a factor of 10! How much does it really take, right? If you have a Trillion dollar asset class, then a Trillion dollars will probably drive it up by a factor of 10. Like if you double the demand? Maybe more! But if youve got a $10 Trillion asset class, a Trillion dollars drives it up by a factor of 2, maybe, or 50%. So as it gets more monetary energy, the inertial component gets greater, the liquidity gets greater! I really think for institutional investors, the halving just doesnt matter anymore! The dynamic that matters is  another example: if Dan Schulman wakes up tomorrow and says, I think I should put Bitcoin on PayPals balance sheet! Dan Schulman has a $300 Billion company! He could put $10 Billion of Bitcoin on the balance sheet! When Coinbase becomes public, they might be worth $100 Billion! If the CEO of Coinbase decides to put Bitcoin on the balance sheet, he could put a Billion on the balance sheet! $23 Billion! The decisions of individuals! Ray Dalio is giving a speech at ConsenSys. Ray Dalios got $150 Billion of assets under management. If he decides that Bitcoin is 25% as good as gold, wont they buy like $10 Billion of it? Ray Dalio, Brian Armstrong, Dan Shulman, right? Individuals! Theres probably 10,000 people in the world that have the ability to put a Billion dollars on the network! 10,000! And theres 1,0002,000 that have the ability to put $10 Billion on the network! Again, every model that you have and all the history that we have is all irrelevant if any of them act! The actors, the actions that get taken place obsolesce and they overwhelm any statistical models, because the statistical models are based upon  like if you told me  for example, in 2018 you have a bunch of Bitcoin and crypto traders that are trading with leverage that have no banks, they cant borrow money against their Bitcoin, okay? Those people have a very short time preference, Saifedean! Youre the time guy, right? The people that have the shortest time preference Ive found are crypto traders! I mean, theyre thinking about whether or not its trading down in the next 8 hours, right? So when I ask people, Why dont you put 100% of your assets into Bitcoin they say, Well I need money to live on! Well why dont you just borrow money? Whos gonna loan me money? BlockFi! Oh BlockFi, they charge 12%, 10%, right? So theres a very embryonic industry right nowthe consumer banking industry thats banking Bitcoin. By the way: name 5 companies thatll give you $100 Million loan against Bitcoin? Name 5. Can you? No! No! Its embryonic! I can name 5 thatll give me a $100 Million loan against Apple stock! Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley  everybody! Okay? And heres my point: Bitcoin doesnt need to change! Whats changing is the banks! The banks are changing! NYDIG will give you a loan! Genesis will give you a loan! When Coinbase will give you a loan  Binance is rolling out some credit products. PayPal wont give you a loan yet, but what happens when PayPal gives 340 Million people a loan at 4% interest against Bitcoin? What happens to Bitcoin? Well, time horizons stretch out! Now I can own it for 30 years. Oh you mean I dont have to sell my Bitcoin to buy my Lamborghini? If you actually believe Bitcoins going up by a factor of 2 every 2 years youre an idiot to sell your Bitcoin to buy your Lamborghini! The Lamborghinis gonna cost you $100 Million! Why dont you borrow the money to buy the Lamborghini and keep the Bitcoin? Well Im afraid! Im afraid of what? Im afraid its gonna crash down by 80%. Why? Well because it did once before! Okay? So you see this circular reasoning which is: I lived in a world of crypto traders on leverage with no banking with no institutional support, and so I act. Its just like your time preference: Im afraid to plan for the future because I dont trust the money! A lot of people in their head, they think Bitcoin is volatile, I dont trust it, I wont be able to borrow against it! And that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy! Theres only a certain amount of  rateat which you can change peoples perceptions, right? It takes 3, 4, 5, 6 years! As the HODLers discover that they can borrow money against Bitcoin, and as the institutions come in  by the way, whats Warren Buffetts famous quote? We find a company we like, our preferred holding period is forever! Is Warren Buffett still owning Coca-Cola stock? Yes! Did he sell it to buy a Lamborghini? No! Did he need to? No! Why? Because he couldve borrowed against it! Yeah! Whats the impact on Coke stock? Its not so volatile! Right? Because hes a HODLer! So this is not an uncommon idea! So institutions that hold gold, how long have they been holding gold? Like, forever! What happens if you replace gold with digital gold? You hold it for 50 years! By the way, I dont think youre gonna be able to buy Bitcoin! Bitcoin below $20,000  gone forever! Bitcoin below $30,000  probably gone forever! Bitcoin below $40,000  probably gone forever! Bitcoin in the $40,00050,000 range? Who do you think is selling this stuff? The weak hands, with high leverage, are selling. Who do you think is buying it? Institutions! That have more money than God! That have 1,000x as much money as theyre buying with this stuff. And which ones? The first 1%, just the early vanguard. So as this happens, the institutions take ownership, their time horizon is a decade. The banks come online, that means we never need to sell it ever! I mean all these guys on crypto Twitter go, Well what are you gonna do if you ever need money? And the answer is: Im never gonna need money! Right? Institutions never need money! If I ever wanted a little bit of cash, I could just borrow a little bit, but the truth of the matter is, the people buying this stuff are endowments! Harvard endowment, Yale endowment, right? So its a different set of holders, its a different banking relationship, its gonna be more diffuse. As its more diffuse, the volatility falls! Youre gonna have the stories of Ruffer, Saifedean! Ruffer bought $750 Million of Bitcoin below $20,000 when it traded at $40,000 they took half off the table, so they took a $750 Million profit. Thats why it didnt trade up beyond $40,000! So then it traded down to $31,000. They might have bought back in, Saif! Those guys, the big institutions, theyre going to be damping it on the upside, on the downside, and collaring it. And this will continue for a while! So its a different dynamic because of the players and the capital and the banks and the security, and its going to continue to evolve and the risk profile and the perceptions will evolve!", "image": null}

I actually think youre gonna see the polarity flip on this! I think that as miners become public like Riot and Marathon, I think theyre gonna think about it and theyre gonna realize they should just keep mining but stop selling!

What happens if $10 Billion comes from the public markets into the Bitcoin market because these miners  I think Marathons got a $3 Billion market cap, Riots got a $3 Billion market cap  what happens if they double and they issue debt or issue equity? My point is: all your models are destroyed! Humility here is  theres a lot of people here that can tip the apple cart here! So if you construct this model based upon the past, youre dismissing the actions of rational actors! Its rational for a miner to buy Bitcoin, not sell Bitcoin! Its rational for a miner to go public! Its rational for Square or PayPal to buy more Bitcoin! They might not, by the way! Its irrational not to! They might not because of volatility. How do you convince your customers to buy Bitcoin with your app when youre afraid to buy it on your balance sheet, right? Isnt there a little bit of a marketing hazard there? So theres rational actors with capital that can move this Bitcoin and they can change the volatility and they can drive it very very hard. And the only thing that keeps them from doing it is getting up in the morning and deciding theyll take a risk! If you basically bet that nobody will act rationally and nobody will take a risk, then you can run your historical models! But if I can break your model  if I break your model with action  then you probably ought to have a more open-ended view of the world, a different model! I look at it and I say, Everybody on Earth with money should buy this stuff and all 7.8 Billion people need it and its only distributed to 0.1% of the market  whats wrong with this picture? At some point, someone is gonna decide to do the rational thing! Arguably theyre doing it now! If price is going up 300% a year, that seems to me to be rational risk-takers acting about as fast as they can reasonably act! Without, you know, going through the sound barrier! Going through the sound barrier  theres a shock wave, and you rip the wings off the airplane! Were kind of pushing up against the sound barrier  the rate at which  whats the fastest an asset class can take on monetary energy without burning itself up! This might be close to the fastest!

But it always goes through those cycles so far with fast and then slow, with variability. So yeah we were due for a very fast year this year anyway. Now look, as an Austrian economist Im always exactly on the same page with you on that fact that it is the actions of humans that determines economic outcomes and not statistical models and constructs! But, this year weve been fascinated a little bit with the Stock to Flow model and it drives me to think that there might be something mechanical about the way that the difficulty adjustment and the mining determine how the price moves, just because theres a limit over how much the price can go up over time!", "image": null}

You know, Zimbabwe inflation rates are different than the US and the US is radically different than a year ago! So I think you gotta take into account monetary policy and I think you gotta take into account technology! Stock to flow doesnt take into account what happens if Tim Cook decides to build Bitcoin into the Apple Watch and into the Apple Phone? Those actions in technology, they have an impact, and doing it sooner rather than later will do it! And I know for a fact there are 10 people in the world  all they would have to do is put out a press release and they would move the price of Bitcoin! And so the technology adoption and the monetary policy  all those things, they have a massive impact on what happens, yet theyre not really part of the stock to flow!", "image": null}

But I meanand rationally, this is why you would expect the model to break down, and yet it doesnt! And that is really the mind-blowing thing as far as Im concerned! And I think  it might sound funny to say it  but the model wouldve expected a big squeeze after the halving! And so you know, thats needed  people like you and MassMutual to show up and carry the banner after weve done the light lifting  you guys do the heavy lifting taking us to $100k! And I think, yeah! 2025 is when you would expect people like Apple to be building their entire company around something like Bitcoin  its a little maybe too early for them to start now but I think maybe by 2025 theyll be sold and theyll be convinced and thats whats going to take us further! So the trend undeniably is Number Go Up! But what the model shows is that that number going up happens in spurts after the halving and then theres a bit of a come down and consolidation after it, that it follows this market pattern. So it seems to be holding up now, and that for me  and its really sacrilegious as an Austrian economist to be saying this  but it suggests that maybe there is something about the way that the network works that is forcing this! And in fact, if you read Mises, what Mises says is, The reason you cant perform economic calculation and make scientific predictions in economics, is that economics does not have a constant. There is no constant in economics. In physics, in chemistry, in math, in all those thingswell not in math  you go back to a physical constant that is personally determined and easy to assert them and all of them go back to constants of nature, eventually. So based on that youre able to make scientific relationships and devise them. And it seems to me that  maybethe stock to flow model is showing us the ability to form calculations with human action for the first time with this kind of accuracy, maybe 21 Million is economics first constant!", "image": null}

I think well see an inversion, its possible that all the Bitcoin miners become public and they stop selling any Bitcoin, and they become banks of their own, they start issuing equity and debt to finance the market, and you could actually see a reverse polarity there! As Bitcoin crashes into institutions that are publicly financeable, I think the dynamic changes quite a lot, because they have different options to access liquidity! So its a different network when its individuals that are unbanked that are in the cash business, than it is when its institutions that are very very well-banked and well-financed! I think the network moving toward the point where its just all transaction-based, and I think the transaction block size  those will get larger and transaction fees will go up and the network will settle into some equilibrium there as well.", "image": null}

If you look at the typical person, everybody owns a set of things: their house, their car, their boat, their trophy assets that theyre gonna keep, and those will have monetary value imbued in them. Those are the goods and products and whatever. And then theres another chunk which is just the treasury  everybodys got a natural treasury. And thats capital saved up for the future against uncertainty! I think its natural that Bitcoin will just continually absorb that treasury energy from endowments, from corporations, from individuals, and my estimate is that it feels like its about half! Half of everything should be treasury and the other half is tangible property! You can estimate it by counting the volume of gold and the total amount in sovereign debt: half of sovereign debtmaybe you want to give a loan to your government because you love the government, but my experience is that 90% of the money invested in sovereign debt wasnt because we loved the government, it was just a store of value! And if you look at the S&P I think people invested in the S&P because they just didnt have confidence in their ability to pick stocks  they wanted a store of value! So I think if you added up all the store of value asset classes, youll probably find yourself getting to a $200 Trillion number, plus or minus, against $400500 Trillion  it depends on how you calculate it! So you kind of conclude its like 4050%. And its kind of common sense, right? Half of your money is, you want to save as fungible asset, and the other half you invest in things you love or things you believe in or you take risks on companies or the like. I think that was pretty obvious back in the day when savings accounts existed, its just that savings accounts have been destroyed and so now people are saving in the stock market!", "image": null}

So long before I discovered Bitcoin I was a Paleo enthusiast and I think that a lot of stuff that comes out of thinking about how Paleolithic man lived for 3 Million years, I think is really useful health advice! What did your forebearers eat, and how did they live 100,000 years ago I think is helpful! Its helpful in your fitness routines and your eating routines. I think that 100,000200,000 years ago people ate lean proteins and they ate low-sugar content  maybe nuts. They didnt eat sugar-laden fruits and they probably didnt eat highly-engineered modern food, they certainly didnt eat any processed food. So my view is, I am pretty much carnivore! I eat a lot of steak, I eat a lot of chicken and fish, but I think that vegetables and nuts are okay! I think the keto diet is a pretty good diet. I understand the Salisbury Diet, I think that in the event that you have auto-immune diseases or inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis Ive seen that its very effective, and so I can imagine living off of all meat, but I think its equally reasonable  if youre coming up with a theory of health, I think if you start with the question: how did human beings live for 3 Million years before the modern agricultural age? And you model your lifestyle based upon that, I think thats consistent with the healthiest lifestyle, and your conclusions are: youre probably not gonna drink orange juice, youre not gonna drink cartons of vodka, youre not gonna consume processed foods, youre not gonna sit in a chair all day long, youre not gonna be afraid to be out in the sun all day long, you should probably do vigorous activity, and you should probably eat lean, healthy proteins!", "image": null}

Welcome back to Episode 3 of the What is Money? Show here in the Saylor Series! So weve covered with Michael Saylor so far the rise of Man through the Stone Ages through the Iron Ages, we went into the Dark Ages, we saw how mankind can have a misstep that causes him to regress 1,000 years, and up into the Steel and Industrial Age. And today were gonna go even further into the future, and the arc of all this is were seeing how mankind does take these evolutionary steps forward in terms of both his morality and the tools that he conducts his life with. And we see, as Michael says, that natural selection through this process, helps mankind become smarter, faster, stronger. And were coming to see that the defensive attributes of technology tend to be more important than offensive attributes over time. This is just leading us deeper into and closer to Bitcoin, which as well talk about later, is the ultimate monetary defensive technology! And in that sense, humans  the reason were able to progress in this way and the reason were different than any other animal  is because we are actually capable of harnessing and channeling energy across these field lines of our intellect. So we can form these abstract concepts and ideas and then actually energize them by harnessing energy in the natural world. And thats why in a geopolitical sense, naval power has been the force that governs the world. He who dominates the sea dominates the world! And in that context were looking now as we progress into the digital age, as digital space being this new high seas, if you will. So in this episode were gonna get into a lot of that and were also gonna finish off by talking about an area that Mr. Saylor is an expert in, which is the history of scientific revolutions. And were gonna talk about in particular the technology diffusion S-curve, which is when a new idea starts to permeate a society, it starts out relatively slowly, toward this inflection point and becomes rapidly adopted at an accelerating pace, before finally hitting a point of full market penetration, it starts to level out. And this will be important to comprehend in terms of not only all the innovations weve seen recently  especially the Internet  but also the path that wed expect Bitcoin to continue to follow. Finally well touch on war. And how it is an accelerant to innovation. And how it can accelerate us down that path of technology S-curve and leaves us eventually with technologies that would be perceived as miracles to primitive man. As Michael will say later, Sufficiently advanced technologies are indistinguishable from magic! So I hope youre pumped! Were still building this big foundation getting into modernity, and this will be one of the final episodes that gets us there! So with that, lets get into it with Episode 3!", "image": null}

If you want a great vignette on why its important to have capital thats mobile, study or just read any history of the Warburgs and what their family went through, and what all the Jewish families went through in the 30s in Germany. And what the bankers had to do to move capital out of the country, and you get a very poignant punctuated appreciation for the need of having secure capital that you control! So theres some, I think, general themes of technology throughout history, if you look across all of these. The general theme is: human beings marching toward being harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! And everyone thats succeeded  every empire, individual, company  they all found a way to be harder, smarter, faster, stronger. George R.R. Martin, he wrote a bunch of books  hes known for Game of Thrones, but he also wrote a bunch of books on superheroes, or at least he called them wildcards. And its about a bunch of superheroes or super-people that have genetic mutations, and they get it from some virus, and its a universe full of normal people, and then jokers  people who have been hideously deformed by this virus, and then aces  people that have been given superpower. And he takes a very modern view of it, and he starts to analyze superpowers: a guy figures out he can shoot laser beams out of his hands, another woman can be invisible, or some dude can be a thin man! And he goes, There a lot of these superheroes, but after a while we quickly realized that the most powerful ones were the ones with defensive superpowers. Defensive attributes overcome all of the offensive attributes in a battle! So for example, the guy thats indestructible with no other superpower, can pick up a machine gun and kill everybody! And you can shoot him a million times, but hes indestructible! Whereas, the guy with the laser beams jumping out of his hands, hes just as mortal as you and me! And you hit him with one rockhe goes down and hes dead! So its the impossible-to-kill ones that end up winning all the battles between superheroes in the smackdown, and the ones with the sexy things, or sexy, really cool superpowers  theyre useless! Because the guy thats got none of those  he just gets a bazooka and he just fires! Or hes like, Im indestructible so Im gonna set off an atomic bomb in the city and kill everybody but myself because Im indestructible! Its pretty easy to win the war if youre indestructible. And it causes you to come to a conclusion about history and who wins in history: unbreakable is better, antifragile is best! So the superhero thats good is the one that you hit him and you cant hurt him! But the superheroes that are most frightening are the ones where you shoot him with a laser beam and now they can shoot your laser beams back at you! And you mind-read them and they absorb your mind-reading and they can mind-read you! And you fly at the speed at the sound and now they can fly at the speed of sound! [11:05] Like that character, what is it ", "image": null}

Maybe Rogue! Its the one that absorbs your power and plays it back at you! You know, pretty soon its like, I am indestructible and I have every other power and you just better get out of the way! And thats antifragile, right? Im looking for the fight! Im looking for people because Im just gonna absorb their thing! So you see that theme through history: the really successful governments, empires, organizations, theyre continually fighting, theyre continually absorbing  the Romans absorbed the Carthaginians navy in 90 days! Its easier said than done! It wasnt like some Roman politician said, These are Carthaginian ships  theyre inferior to us. We will invent our own ships! Its like, Not too proud to copy, not too proud to absorb it! This kind of principle can explain the success the United States in the wars of the last century or more. Why did we win World War I, World War II? Why is America America? Well theres two narratives. Millionaires. One is: because were more patriotic and were righteous and were better! The other one is: the Europeans were fighting in Europe and we were fighting in Europe! So we were fighting, they were soft! When youre dropping bombs in the middle of suburban Germany, youre attacking the soft underbelly of the citizens in Germany, or the soft underbelly of the citizens in France, or the Battle of Britain. This is the citizen population being ravaged by a war. And that destroyed their economies, right? Destroyed their culture! Same happened in Russia, Italy. Its happened in China, and the Chinese fought a war in Chinas soil. The Japanese fought sort of a portion of a war on their own soil with the atomic warheads. On the other and, the US hadnt fought a war on US soil since 1865. Okay? So whos hard? Back to this missile idea, right? If you can throw a missile 3,000 miles and your enemy can throw a missile back 300 miles back at you  its pretty simple: I have a rifle, you have a pistol! I stand back 1,000 feet  your pistols good for 200 feet! I take 100 shots, eventually 1 hits  youre a perfect shot, it doesnt matter! Longer arms! So this idea: art you unbreakable? Or back to terrain: what is the terrain? The geography determines a lot of things! If you take a modern ship: take a modern yacht built in the year 2020, with every piece of modern equipment on it. Now try to sail it to Afghanistan! You probably wont get there! Something will probably break! Try to sail it to Rome without stopping in a port along the way. You probably wont make it! Robert, nobody does! They all stop and hide somewhere! Its really hard to move stuff over the ocean thousands of miles! Its really hard! Now, why dont you try to sail an armada of 1,000 ships 3,000 miles in order to invade America? Germans couldnt sail 13 miles across the Straits of Dover! The Japanese couldnt cross from Japan to China during the kamikaze, and thats not very far! Its really hard! Theres only one guy that ever pulled it offWilliam the Conqueror in 1066! Nobody else managed to cross 13 miles. Thats your hydraulic moat! Its really hard! It explains the culture of the U.K. It explains the culture of the United States. It explains a lot of other culture. It explains the balance of power, I think! If you just say, Heres someone that you couldnt kill who could kill you! I had the option to fight on your turf, but you would never have the option to fight on my turf. Now, that in and of its way is the reason that security is so incredibly important to the Bitcoin network! What is important is that it not break! If Im indestructible, I dont have to be the fastest, the shiniest, the whatever anything! I just have to be indestructible! If Im indestructible  the indestructible man goes and buys a machine gun and hes the most powerful superhero in the room, right? The indestructible blockchain goes and buys a digital app, or another crypto network, an off-chain app, or a Lightning, or a Binance, or a Coinbase, or a Square Cash or whatever, and its just fine! Its the most powerful network in the room! [17:29] Because the thing that made it the winner was its indestructibility, its immortality! Not the fact that it could shoot laser beams from its fingers, or it was beautiful, or it could fly with its pretty wings, or it was invisible. All of these other things? Privacy, transactions  all these other things, theyre interesting, but they pale compared to the characteristic of immortality! Being indestructible in the here and now  pretty useful superhero power! Being indestructible and never aging  double useful superpower! And as for the rest, if youre an open software protocol, someones gonna code an extension to your protocol to give you every other cool power that anybody wants! I can find a way to construct every other superpower by hook or crook, and that makes me antifragile and now Im like the frightening impossible-to-stop superhero!", "image": null}

The mining rate, its like a secondary particular effect that happens in the first few years of its evolution, but exponentially it becomes irrelevant. Its a second order driver. The first order driver is, [Is] the hardness infinitely hard? And then adoption and utility and inflation in the fiat reference frame that its operating in. A couple more points that are worth making on technology and human history. Humans triumph throughout history by channeling energy. All of these things come down to: how did I channel energy? So, navy power. The British Navy ruled the sea, the Phoenicians, the Venetians, the Greeks, the Romans. The Americans today control the seas via their aircraft carriers and via naval power. And naval power is just bringing overwhelming stronger force to bear thats faster, thats harder, than any other force anywhere on Earth. I park an aircraft carrier somewhere and death rains from above! So weve seen all empires are driven by a naval power. In time, we invented airplanes. And then air power became the thing! And air power is again all about death from above: the most powerful navy idea is airplanes flying off an aircraft carrier! First it was the battleship by: show up in your harbor  I blast everything. Then it became air power. And if I could get above you  and we saw this in [inaudible 21:56]  it is impossible for a modern nation state to function if it does not control its own air space. You saw that in the First Gulf War, the Second Gulf War. The United States, especially the United States air force, could pretty much bomb any country back to the Stone Age in a matter of a week, once you lose your air supremacy, once you lose control of your air space. Theres no hope for you! You can take out every port, every power reactor, every generator, every serious building, theyre all gone. Death from above! Theres nothing you can do! Youre at the bottom of the gravity well. And with technology today, someone can sit out 6 miles up  you cant shoot down a plane moving at high speeds 6 miles up! You have to fight the gravity well to get there! Theyre just working opposite: its an energy thing, right? So Im moving from a lower energy stateIm on the ground moving enemies around, to a higher energy state  I have a boat, Im moving heavy masses around, to a higher energy state  Im above you dropping munitions on you. Then after that, it became nuclear power! You harness nuclear power and that ended World War II pretty definitively in a hurry. Then we go to space satellite power! And then you go up the gravity well some more, and that manifests itself primarily with GPS. If you look at the impact of having a Global Positioning Satellite, thats what allows me to drop a laser-guided bomb or a drone anywhere on Earth and guide it day or night to anything! And thats a massive source of American supremacy  controlling those GPS satellites! And you lose them  big problem, too! [23:53] One of my favorite books, and I note it, is The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. And in it, Robert Heinlein, he writes about a bunch of Looniesbasically Libertarians that live on the moon that believe in making their own way, and their motto is, There aint no such thing as a free lunch! Abbreviated to TANSTAAFL, and he introduced that idea, and he introduced that idea. And they take it to the extreme, which is like, Youre airs not even free on the moonyou pay for everything! You pay for water, you pay for food, you pay for air. Everybody pulls their own weight. No one waits for a bail-out. Theres no bail-out coming from anybody. And theyre not big fans of authority. They dont like being told what to do! And the plot of the book winds on that theyre being oppressed by Earthlings who are making them work as slaves and theyre taking 90% of their economic productivity and shipping back basically their future to Earth and theyre gradually suffocating and starving them to death. Its just onerous. Taxation without representation! But onerous. So the Loonies decide to fight back with the help of an A.I. computer. The first A.I. computer I can remember! The name of the computer is Mike, by the way! And their technique is they realize that theyve gotta catapult, and they start tossing rocks down the gravity well, and they just take a big rock, put it in their catapult, and it doesnt take that much force to toss it off the moon because theyre low-G, theyre tossing the rock out of a 1/8th G or whatever, and it hits the Earth, goes into a trajectory, and of course this starts picking up speed! And by the time it lands, its like an atomic warhead. They just start tossing em at random places until the Federation Empire thats oppressing them decides that maybe its had enough! And of course the lesson is: its humans channeling energy, but theyre channeling gravitational energy  and a lot of it! And theres a lot more energy than the stuff that we have! All through human history  since a million years ago to today  its really the story of intelligent people looking around for, Where is the energy coming from? And how do I channel it in a network in order to achieve something harder, smarter, faster, stronger?", "image": null}

They predicted the rise of what they called narrowcasting, as opposed to broadcasting, which we would call social media today. They predicted the rise of anonymous digital cash which would be disruptive to the nation state, which we would think Bitcoin is. And it also predicted the digitization of securities, so other property rights going away from a government function to be provided via software. And one of the things that was interesting there is that they compared digital space to the high seas. Basically saying, The reason why whoever controls the high seas controls the world is because thats the most frictionless environment! You can move things with the least energy on the seas, once you can conquer them. So whoever controls that domain sort of controls the world. But also  because its frictionless  its very difficult to project dominion over the high seas. So we dont have law, really  we have international waters everywhere in the world! And they compare that and analogize it to digital space, where its a frictionless space that whoever is dominant there will be dominant in the 21st century, but it will also be very difficult to project dominion. So it will be unregulated, largely! So theyre using that to kind of make the case for digital cash, and the fact that people would be able to escape oppressive regimes. Once you get your capital in the digital space, youre no longer under the thumb of the government of the local oppressive monopoly. So I just think its interesting how it just always comes down to the terrain, right?", "image": null}

And its harder and harder in those ways for the government to control what information you get, and then how you manage your assets.

It seems like it gets harder for any one government to assert control over the things that take place virtually. So theres a lot of virtual empowerment going on, but theres a lot of other things going on too! I guess I would end this section with just a couple of dynamics that I think Ive seen over and over again with technology. When I was at MIT I studied the history of science and I read about the structure of scientific revolutions and I studied all different types of technology diffusions. And theres certain things that pop out. A lot of times youll see an S-curve where itll start slow and itll accelerate until it reaches diminishing returns, and then all of a sudden its not an interesting technology anymore! You see that a lot! But, one of the lessons of history is: its very difficult to figure out when the curve starts, and its hard to stop it once it starts, but its a lot easier to invest in it and to forecast it once it starts. But before it starts, people will say, Well next year this will commercializeor in 2, 5, 10 years. You could be off by 2 years, you could be off by 100 years! You remember Google Glass? How big that was gonna be? And how that was a lead balloon, and how many years is it after Google Glass and its still not gonna happen next year either! Technology fails until it succeeds  thats another trend and another theme. So you see over and over again people pick at technologists and theyll say, Oh itll never work! Itll never work! Itll never work! In the year 1902, before the Wright brothers flew that next year, if youd asked the most learned people on Earth, they wouldve given you 100 reasons why airplanes will fly, and they would give you 100 examples of how they didnt fly, and they would talk you to death. And the thing about these paradigm shifts is, oftentimes its not the learned individuals that make the breakthrough! Aircraft werent designed by professors of aeronautics and astronautics and engineering and fluid dynamics and mathematicians  they all failed miserably! The Wright brothers were bicycle mechanics! They had a bicycle shop  tinkerers! Theyre the ones that ushered in the age! And they did it against all conventional wisdom! And on the other hand, Leonardo da Vinci tried to develop his own flying contraption! Every brilliant person for hundreds of years tried it  failed! All failed! And then some dudes in Dayton, Ohio that have a bicycle shop succeed. It happens like that! The story of John Harrison inventing, discovering a method to determine longitude on the ocean  its articulated in the book, Longitude, its an amazing story! Everybody knew how to find lattitude, it was easy, it was just like, against the North Star. But longitudes very hard because the Earths spinning all the time and it required massively complicated calculations! They gave it to Newtonian professors at Cambridge and Oxford  the smartest mathematicians and astronomers in the world  no one could figure it out! Finally they posted a 10,000 prize and John Harrisonwho was not a mathematician, hes a clockmaker figured it out! And the way he figured it out is he made a clock that was accurate, and they put one clock on the ship, and they set it to the Greenwich Observatory, the royal observatory, which is in Greenwich, England. Hence the term, Greenwich Mean Time. Greenwich Mean Time comes because you sail down the Thames past the royal observatory in Greenwich, you set your clock on that, and then you have another clock, and then every day at noon  if youre in the Caribbean you look up and then you set that clock  and then you just subtract the time on the one from the time from the other, multiply it by 15 degrees and youve got your longitude! It was a tinkerers solution to a problem everybody else wanted to solve with star charts and tables and complex math! But of course, ships captains in the middle of the Caribbean or in a storm, they cant do complex math! They just wanna stay alive! So you see lots of examples in history where people try to do something and they either accidentally discover it like Penicillin, or a tinkerer discovers it, and not the educated  and then all the professors crap all over it, and they all swear itll never work! And the tendency is either to reject it  people dont like change  or it doesnt get embraced until everybody dies, or until theres a war! And war has a way of opening your mind because when someone drops a bomb on your head and youre burning or screaming, then the pain causes you to take a more open-minded attitude! So a lot of stuff happened after World War II and happens in various wars, and you can trace it through human history! That drives innovation faster! Generational change will drive it faster. People keep trying it, and then just because its failed 1,000 times doesnt mean it wont succeed, but when it does succeed, then its probably unstoppable for a while! And hence, yeah you just get to this phrase, which is kind of punctuation for modern technology: Arthur C. Clark writes, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. And it was a great quote, its a quote that I put on the back of my prospectus when my company became public in 98. I believed it then  we have thousands and thousands of examples of magic things in our lives today! Literally magic things, that are just technical things! Its always been that way, and to a primitive man, a rifle looks magical! Or an airplane! And now, were starting to deal with some software technologies and digital technologies that dont just look magical to a primitive man, theyre gonna look magical to a modern man! Because they just really are getting pretty magical!", "image": null}

So that was Episode 3 of the Saylor Series. I hope you enjoyed that! We continue our progress towards modernity, and laying this really solid intellectual foundation through the lens of technology, anthropology, civilizational development, military  all of these aspects that lead us to the importance of Bitcoin as money! And as I said in the intro, I like to think of this whole arc as an evolutionary process. I actually consider that evolution is the inorganic form of innovation, or you could say that innovation is the organic form of evolution. So theyre both about colliding ideas together and with reality, to test which ideas, strategies, and approaches work best. Which offer the highest utility to the organism or human being thats set an intention and an aim. Its through this iterative processas Saylor says it makes us harder, faster, and stronger. And I think whats starting to shape up here as I think youll see is that the defensive attributes tend to be even more important than offensive attributes. So if you have an ability to defend yourself say behind a wall of water  youre in the United States, were defended on both sides by large walls of water in the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, we have this natural defensive advantage! So its really difficult to invade us without having long-ranging weapons when we dominate the naval territory already. We are the dominant naval force because of our access to the oceans and our protection from hostile powers. And I liked the analogy that Saylor gave when he talked about the George R.R. Martin superheroes  I think they were called the Aces. It wasnt the superhero with the best offensive capability  the laser beams out of the eyes or whatever  that became dominant, it was actually the one that was indestructible! Because he could essentially subject himself to any situation and survive! Which reminded me of that saying which I think is from Sun Tzu  it might be from Lao Tzu  If you wait long enough by the river, you live to see the bodies of your enemies float by. So its this point that, if you are optimized for survivability, that tends to make you dominant competitor over time, right? Time is on your side! Whereas time would be a raid against all of your competitors. And as time being the ultimate judge of all things, its probably the defining competitive competency you could have, is just really high resiliency or robustness, or ideally even, antifragility, where youre actually improving from the hostility you face in the world! And advancing through adversity! So I thought that was interesting and clearly plays really well into the Bitcoin narrative. We were looking at how the terrain had shaped battles throughout history and why America fighting in Europe in say World War II was much different than war taking place on American soil. We were fighting and attacking the soft underbelly as Saylor called it, but we werent exposed to that same level attack ourselves! Well with the small exception of Pearl Harbor. And thats why the nation that controls the sea controls the world, because that is the terrain that its the hardest to project power and dominion across, so whoever is dominant there just runs things! You can move energy around the world much more quickly and bring to force to bear much more quickly anywhere in the world. And so when you look at Bitcoin through that lens, its like its already the longest and most rigid chain, so it has already become dominant! If you look at digital space and compare it to the ocean, Bitcoin has dominated digital space for monetary networks! Its impossible to compete with it as money, because its already perfected all the properties that make money money, and its done so in this digital terrain that all other competitors would be competing for! Which is: its a very low friction domain, so you can move things at the speed of light in the digital space. And you can defend things with cryptography at very low cost! You can basically erect these impenetrable walls of encrypted energy at relatively low cost. So Bitcoin has just optimized for that! It gives us a way to store the vital life energy that is money behind a wall that basically cannot be breached! I like that military analogy pointing to it as a very fundamental breakthrough. And the other thing there  we didnt talk about this in this episode  that I think about, is: it sort of balances this antifragility or robustness with also a degree of adaptivity. So even though Bitcoin is the longest chain and the most rigid, it has these unbendable rules that favors its holders, it also still maintains this ability to adopt new features that are beneficial to it! And one of my favorite authors and good friend, Brandon Quittem, hes written about this! In Mycelial space this is called Horizontal gene transfer. So when a Mycelium  which is the underground informational network of a fungus, like a mushroom  when it encounters a threat in the environment, it can actually code new enzymes and proteins and defense mechanisms against that threat at one particular spot. These Mycelial mats can be tens of, hundreds of square miles in size! But if it encounters a threat, it creates a formula to neutralize it, and even any one spot of that Mycelial mat, it can incorporate those lessons into the entire organism! So its actually learning from interaction with its competitors at the edges, but then incorporating all of its lessons into the entire organism! Which is something that Bitcoin is capable of doing! So its kind of a tangent but pretty interesting stuff in regards to Bitcoin! And then, as we said earlier, what distinguishes us as human is that we have this unique ability  I think Saylor described it earlier  were the only animal that plays with fire. So we have this special ability to mold our behavior in a way that allows us to harness energy and then we can channel it. We can create these abstractions of thought and speech in the ideological space, and then we can use that energy to energize these formulas that weve created. And thats what makes us human! Thats what we do! When you look at anything  you look at a table or a house or a computer, all of these things began as ideas that we then funneled energy into. We harnessed energy in the natural world whether its hydrocarbons or fire  which was kind of the Stone Age energy network  solar radiation, whatever it may be! And we channel that energy into the manifestation of these ideas. And thats what helps us become more productive and enjoy a higher quality of life over time. Its such a radical new way to look at humanity, it really makes you appreciate being human! I think too, we were talking about the naval power and how thats shaped us throughout history. Naval power was the predominant aspect of what determined which nation is in geopolitical control, but what I think  and I got this from I book I read called The Next 100 Years  that predicted that in the 21st century it would actually no longer be control of the seas that mattered so much, but it would come to be control of space. And you see that somewhat in US military dominance today in that we control the seas actually with our aircraft carriers, which essentially means we can control the air space of nations. Again back to fighting the battle on the terrain that favors you most: by going into the skyagain this very frictionless space of air  were also able to take advantage of the gravity well that is the planet. So we can drop bombs at a very low cost. For a plane to release a bomb is essentially no cost once its up there, but it brings us gigantic force to bear on its terrestrial targets! And thats why its in that sense we can consider today being this extension of naval power. It has the highest optionality. It has the greatest, most degrees of freedom both offensively and defensively. Its really hard to shoot down one of these aircrafts moving at supersonic speed, which gives it a lot of defensive capability, but it also can bring a lot of force to bear really quickly by dropping bombs or shooting missiles. And all of this is facilitated by control of that frictionless space in the sea, which is the aircraft carrier, which itself is very hard to attack because its thousands of miles out to sea, its just flying these planes in! So thats why the aircraft carrier today is the dominant military technology. But I think as we get further into the 21st century, if you go even another layer higher say into low-Earth orbit, you can get into a territory that has even more offensive and defensive optionality, and its just way harder to attack! Its literally in orbit! And in the book I referred to, The Next 100 Years, I think they were called ion cannons. So the thought was, whichever country came to get these ion cannons into orbit first would have a power thats even superordinate to what we consider aircraft carriers to be today. So the space  if you want to call it space, its kind of just Earth orbit  is the next frontier for military dominance. I think that will be really interesting to see shake out as we look at the development of history through this lens going forward. And Saylor brought up that book The Moon is a Harsh Mistress that really brought this point home to me, because there were these rebels on the Moon, and they were tired of being tyrannized by Earthlings, so they basically took advantage of their ultimate high ground and just started throwing rocks at Earth! And because it was at the bottom of that gravity well, the Earthlings were forced to capitulate eventually and give into their demands! So it just keeps going back to this principle of holding high ground, holding the best terrain in any confrontation. [51:35] Like the moon, digital space, it is the ultimate high ground! It enables us, even as an individual today with Bitcoin, you can safeguard Billions of dollars of capital, which is life force, by memorizing a 12-word seed phrase. You can move it around the world at the speed of light permissionlessly at virtually zero cost! If youre talking about moving $1 Billion worth of Bitcoin you can probably move it for from $5-$20. You try to move that same $1 Billion across space in a fiat currency system, youre gonna spend a lot of time navigating regulations of both the regime youre sending from and the regime youre sending to, youre gonna pay a lot of bank fees, youre gonna be answering a lot of questions, youre gonna be probably paying a lot of taxes as well. The number one export of empires is being security! They gatecheck all these movements of value across their domain. And so these rights and abilities that were reserved for the nation states in eras past  where they could move goods and capital  if theyre dominant militarily they could do so pretty much without permission, they could do whatever they want! That same capability is now being delivered to the individual via software! So its this radical new worldview thats shaking out where, because we dont need an empire to honor  at least the property rights of money with Bitcoin  as far as we can see today, maybe other property rights will follow as well in time. But that is a big slice out of a pie! We also dont need the nation states to honor the property rights of money, that entire function of trust and security has fallen to distributed software! And its hard to even fathom how big of a game changer that really is! And when I think about that a little more, its just that these digital high seas, theyre weakening the geographic constraints to being. All of a sudden, youre not as beholden to the local monopolies and systems, because you can now participate in this global network that has many more degrees of freedom and a much lower need for permissions. You dont need to check as many boxes and satisfy as many bureaucrats interacting with the digital domain. It really is this much more of a pure free market environment, where the best ideas win if youre able to serve your customer! By whatever means necessary you can earn a living! My mind goes back to a story of girls in the Middle East that are actually prohibited from holding bank accounts! Its illegal for women to hold bank accounts in certain countries, so this contributes to their disenfranchisement, because they cant even earn a living in the home. So women not only are perceived as second-class citizens but in many ways are second-class citizens because they cant hold a bank account, they cant contribute to the livelihood of their home, so theyre just forced to stay home and work and do as their told, while the men go out and make a living! But with Bitcoin, some of the women at least were able to find jobs online! Whether its copy-editing or anything you could do that was informational. Any job that you could conduct online, which is more and more jobs as we become more advanced. And they were able to be paid and remunerated in Bitcoin! So all of a sudden they just leapfrogged this entire restrictive system that would really prevent them from even increasing their own condition in life. They cannot improve their own conditions because theyre trapped in this cage, but all of a sudden Bitcoin gave them this exit option to just go out into the world and earn a living based on their own skills! So thats just one example of how the geographic constraints are weakened. And I think well see many more of those coming out. Another thing that comes to mind here is: Ive analogized Amazon in the past. Amazon came to be a dominant monopoly in the world because they essentially out-competed four digital distribution networks, which are a naturally scarce service for the world. You only need  it has a huge network effect, so theres big economies of scale and a big advantage to being bigger in that space. And Amazon was able to bootstrap itself in a way by leveraging two things, two benefits of being digital and not being a brick and mortar. Firstly, they were able to offer low prices to their customer because they had lower costs of fulfillment. They didnt have brick and mortar stores. For a while they were skirting sales tax, so they would distribute from a state that had low to no sales tax, and they were selling it to other states without being deemed for sales tax. So theyre taking advantage of this digital space. And then Two, because in a bookstore you can only fit so many titles. Maybe you can fit only a quarter million books in a store, but the advantage to being online in an online store is that you have literally limitless selection! Anything that is available on Earth, you can sell in your store! So I think thats one of the reasons Bezos zeroed in on books  Amazon started out as an online book store  is because that is a product where that advantage is super favorable! There are millions of books written, the selection is just endless! Theyre a totally non-fungible thing. Every book is different. And I think Bezos started there and used that as his pressure point, because he could leverage not only the sales tax and lack of brick and mortar as we mentioned earlier, but he could also leverage the limitless selection capability of an Internet-based bookstore to really just dethrone a lot of competition. So he could offer it at lower prices and he could offer it at wider selection! So super interesting there! And he was smart enough to leverage the advantages of the digital business model in a really pressure-point focused way! And when I look at tech and Bitcoin through that lens, I see  and Saylor alluded to this as well  the overall trend is that distributed software and encryption is very empowering to the individual! So these things that we used to need large entities to satisfy, because there are a lot of fixed costs that you had to incur to deliver these functions, whether it was a bookstore or whether it was a bank custodying your gold  all of a sudden we could do these things via software at very low fixed cost! It can be replicated at near zero variable cost! So once its up and running you can basically do it anywhere net of the actual physical distribution fees! Assuming there are some, right? If its software theres basically no distribution fee either. Thats what the Apple App Store is. And so, its interesting to see how that  Im thinking about this a lot. Its like, Okay, we needed empires and large entities in the past to provide security, to create this intersubjective fabric of trust in the world so that we could interoperate, but now a lot of these human-based politicized or politicizable institutions are now going into trust-minimized software! Where its like, Here are the rules, you cant bend them or break them! And Bitcoin is just the greatest expression of that! Amazon and stuff like that they still have a political dimension because theyre traditional organizations. Theyre essentially under control. But something like Bitcoin is just a pure instance of that: its just pure unbendable, unbreakable rules that help you channel energy across time and space, and satisfy wants more efficiently! I think too  and this gets a bit into the Sovereign Individual thesis  we didnt get into this a lot in the interview but, as people wake up to this truth that we have this ultimate savings technology in cyberspace or this non-state central bank, whatever we want to call it, its a medium for permissionlessly storing your wealth in a way to no one can compromise! And you dont need any government to then acknowledge or honor the property rights you have in Bitcoin. Youve converted property rights to information! Owning is now knowing! With the increasing incentives to exit inflationary currency  again the book The Sovereign Individual goes really deep into this, but  the numbers are roughly: for every $10,000 you can reduce your tax liability, assuming you can compound that capital at an average return rate of 10%, youre talking about tens of millions of dollars over the average earners lifetime. It becomes at least a multi-million dollar and in many cases tens of millions of dollars decision of holding your money in an inflationary fiat versus holding your money in non-inflationary Bitcoin. So I think as the market wakes up to this and starts to do the calculus, I think youre just gonna see this overwhelming demand for security from distributed tech  with such secure money as in Bitcoin  and its just gonna pull demand out of these anachronistic security models like the nation state and banks and all these other politicized institutions! And you know  wow! Its just a lot to even think about! Its hard to even fathom where that goes! The Sovereign Individual predicted social media, they predicted Bitcoin. Another thing they predicted was the actual digitization of security  so other property rights getting eaten by software. And my general thought there is that the governments not gonna let go of any of this willingly. Its not like the government ever acknowledged and accepted Bitcoin! Bitcoin just grew up in the wild somewhat flying under the radar long enough to establish itself as something thats really difficult to take down now. Today I think were at $350 Billion market cap of Bitcoin, so its a really entrenched monetary network at this point, and its exhibited a lot of antifragility! I think as  my theory would be  as Bitcoin continues to ascend and demonetize inflationary government business models, that some of these functions that governments have bureaucratized will just start to fall to free market competitors. Theres just gonna come a point where governments no longer solve enough to keep  one example I like that I heard from Saifedean is  theres a national train agency in Lebanon, and he made the point that there hasnt been a track of railroad in Lebanon for 50 years. Its that old saying that, Theres nothing more permanent than a temporary government solution! So we have all these layers of unnecessary bureaucratic buildup across the world in all the countries! Because theyre not accountable to their PnL! Theres no free market competition keeping them honest! So they get away with these asinine models where they have a train committee but no trains! So I think as those useless or worthless or unaccountable institutions start to shrivel up and die because theres no funding for them, that youll see whatever functions that they provided or were intended to provide start to fall into the free market  I think software is just eating that up! So that is a lot to think about, and its something to keep your eye on! I also liked how Saylor dove into this diffusion of technology which is really just another way of saying the diffusion of ideas. And it follows the S-curve. This isI think its The History of Scientific Revolutions  and it talks about this S-curve where theres a beginning or theres innovators that adopt it first, and then it hits an inflection point say around 13.5% market penetration, and the innovation starts becoming adopted at a super accelerated rate! So the curve just goes vertical for a while until its suffused and saturated the market sufficiently where it starts to level off and you have the laggards sort of adopting it late. And when we look at Bitcoin through that lens, were very early in the flat part of the curve. Were far below 13.5% total adoption! Were probably more in the range of 13% as we sit here in late 2020. And Saylor just makes this great point that those curves are impossible to predict! You never know when its going to work! The idea can exist for hundreds of years before it ever gets commercialized! You think back to the Native Americans that had the pottery wheel, but never figured out to turn it on its side and use it as a wagon wheel! The idea was there but no one had harnessed it or commercialized it! But his point is that once it does become commercialized it hits a certain critical mass that its very clear to see that you can invest in it now  like were almost right before it hits that vertical point and reaches just huge gains as the rest of the world wakes up to the importance and utility of the innovation! And I thought that was great. The other thing  in his book The Virtual Wave, which I read preparing for this  he laid out in 2010 saying Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google  buy these, hold  theyre gonna eat everything! Dont diversify! Heres why  going into the network effects and all of this history of scientific revolutions and paradigm shifts. He saw that! And hes now proclaiming Bitcoin to be a similar pattern of proliferation! It has reached this critical mass! Were north of $100 Billion market cap! The race has been won, almost, for digital money, and now its just a question of how big does digital money become relative to everything else, relative to analog money? If youre keen to believe the advantages that digital tech has over analog tech, I mean clearly Im a Bitcoin bull, I would say it eats all of em! It offers so much more utility to the users, and its so much more energy efficient! Its as if: you dont adopt it  you just get left behind! So theres this Darwinian propulsion to adopt the hardest money and we cant get any harder than Bitcoin! Its 21 Million fixed and forever! And then he brought up too that these things seem crazy at first, like when the Wright brothers finally flew, had their first maiden voyage and figured out how to fly, he made the point that anyone you interviewed up until that time  you could have interviewed the smartest people in the world, they would tell you flat out its not possible, mankind will never fly, it just cant be done! Until its done, right? Until a tinkerer figures it out in their garage! Which points to  its the tinkerers and not the theoreticians that bring about breakthrough! I feel like some people think that there are geniuses sitting inside of Harvard writing out a bunch of complex formulas that figure out this practical mechanical innovation in the world, and thats just largely not the case! Its entrepreneurs putting their skin in the game, failing, failing forward, learning from their mistakes, facing the unknown, adapting to the unknown, trying new things, and then all of a sudden theres a breakthrough! All of a sudden, the plane flies, the Wright brothers are sky-bound! So thats what drives humanity forward! Its this relentless impulse to tinker and play with things, not the intellectuals sitting in their ivory towers theorizing. And he brought up too that John Harrison  no one could figure out longitude! It was easy to figure out lattitude, but no one could figure out longitude. And how did they solve it? They put a reward in the paper! It was a 10,000 reward: anyone that could solve this, how to calculate longitude, well give you a financial reward! So what did they do? They went to the free market! They incentivized the collective intelligence of humanityas best they could  through the newspaper at the time, and this guy John Harrison the clock maker comes out of the woodwork and figures out, Hey! I can solve this spatial problem which is the calculation of longitude at sea, with a temporal answer! Hes a clock maker, right? So he makes this super-precise clock, which is just kind of out of the blue! Like, had he been a theoretician, he wouldve just sat there and tried to figure out how to calculate space and observational things, but this guy took a 180 and he solved a spatial problem with a temporal solution. And thats the kind of problem-solving you get out of the free market that you just wont get out of legislated innovation or think tanks or things like this! So the point there I think is: you cant push water! Innovation is something that emerges naturally through us  our creative impulse! You cant force it! You cant yell at your garden to grow faster, right? It needs to go through its own natural process of discovery to get the best ideas to the surface! And the only thing we can hope to do in our socioeconomic systems is to incentivize that, right? They gave, they put a reward in the paper for this! Thats what the free market is! Just go into the world: you have the liberty to do pretty much anything you want as long as you dont hurt anyone, kill anyone, or steal from anyone  these are the actual pillars of free market capitalism! And make bets! Invest your time, energy, and capital onto things you think  onto solving problems you think the market wants solved! And you think you have a unique way to do it! And by betting against one another, we develop better, faster, and cheaper ways of doing things! We incentivize this ideation process that rewards humanity forever in the form of innovation! And I like to say there that its the tinkering entrepreneurs  theres nothing more problematic to problems than tinkering entrepreneurs! If we want to solve problems, we need to harness our collective ingenuity, and we do that through free market capitalism and tinkering, not through legislation! Finally, we got into war. We talked about it as an accelerant to innovation. My thought there is pretty simple. Its just that: war pushes you into a domain of high uncertainty where the relevance of everything becomes accentuated, because you dont know whats gonna happen next, you dont know maybe how much food you need to save, or money, or what kind of money, or weapons, or where you need to be  everything becomes much more relevant when youre in unexplored territory, so to speak. And that  and they say, Necessity is the mother of all invention  its like, all of a sudden, youre pushed by your survival instinct to necessarily figure out all your now very relevant surroundings very quickly. So it accelerates that S-curve adoption, or it accelerates these ideas that may have been idle for some time! All of a sudden theres a big impetus to figure it out. And thats whats going on right now in 2020. We have a war on cash, we have a war on COVID, everyones strapped into seclusion, a lot of people are out of work, inflation is right around the corner, so everyones been pushed to figure things out and I love that Saylor paints that picture of the war on COVID being an accelerant to Bitcoin and to digital technologies more generally! And finally, I love this quote that he references from Arthur C. Clarke that, Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic! All of these modern miracles that we take for granted, theyre all generated from free markets, and if you pull a primitive man out of the Stone Age and brought him here into 2020, he would just be flabbergasted! All of this stuff just looks like magic: this camera, this laptop. And thats why Bitcoin is so misunderstood  consider the joke, right? Magic Internet Money! Its disparaged like that! But what I think it actually is is that it is this radically more innovative and advanced technology that people are just trying to get their head around! And also there in the long run and the great promise of it is to help us make even more magic in the free market! To create even more advanced technologies by eliminating the barriers to trade! Again, tinkerers operating freely in the open marketplace is where we discover all the new and useful things that make life easier and better! And weve honored that paradigm to some extent  especially in Western civilization  but weve erected these artificial barriers to it with fiat currency and central banking and overly complex tax codes, convoluted laws  all these things are frictions to free trade! So Bitcoin by defunding these inefficient institutions, its eroding these barriers to free trade, and therefore bolstering the innovation generated by free markets! So in that sense I think Bitcoin not only is a magic internet money, but its going to make the world much more magical in the long run! I hope you guys enjoyed that! That was Episode 3 with Michael Saylor. Weve probably got 10 episodes total, so well be back soon with the next one. Until then, take care!", "image": null}

This is Robert Breedlove, and welcome to Episode 2 of the Saylor Series on the What is Money? Show! So in Episode 1, we covered the rise of Man through the Stone and the Iron Ages. So we went into ancient technologies. We talked about fire, missiles, and hydraulics [inaudible]. And now in this episode were gonna go a little further in this arc of Man, and were gonna go into the Dark Ages. Were gonna go learn how missing one key step along the path of civilization actually caused us to slide backwards and to regress, and that civilization is not a guarantee! It is something that must be continually pushed forward and maintained across time. Well also get into how humanity re-emerged from the Dark Ages, ultimately into the Industrial Age and the Steel Age, which enabled a lot of very important technologies like cities, aviation, and railroads  things of this sort. So were going to touch on, again, the benefits that are offered by standardization. Also the benefits of protocol, similar to the ones we talked about in Ancient Roman times earlier, and how the economic benefits of the standardization  one language or one protocol  actually accrete to civilization. So these cost efficiencies accrete to us in the form of being able to satisfy wants faster, cheaper, and better! And thats actually the force that drives civilization and increases both economic and network density for mankind. [03:06] Were also gonna talk about how violence and monopolization have shaped the course of history. How violence has been used to extract rents and taxes, how gatekeepers have influenced the course of history, and how monopolies have developed in both a natural and an unnatural way. And well also talk about packaged foods, and how much of an influence that had on civilization, enabling us to store energy in a leak-proof container. And also mankinds ability to eradicate some infectious diseases was such a huge boon to humanity in terms of increasing life expectancy and quality of life as well. Again, the general aim of this is to construct a solid intellectual foundation on which to understand the profound impact that we believe Bitcoin will have on the world. And you can think about Bitcoin, as Saylor refers to it, as an engineering breakthrough, and that for the first time in history, we have a technology that is able to store the energetic of life force that money represents! Again we can think of money as a claim on all of the sources of energy in the world, whether its capital, chemical energy, kinetic energy, food energy  all these types of energy, money acts as kind of a meta-energy. And weve never had a monetary technology that was totally leak-proof, and that it did not lose value over time! So hopefully by drawing analogies to these very important innovations across history, youll start to have an emerging realization of the real importance and significance of Bitcoin! So with that, lets jump into Episode 2 and at the end of this Ill do a little outro to hopefully synthesize some of these ideas. Alright, thanks!", "image": null}

But we got here  thats impressive! We have the Roman rise, and we saw a sophisticated society mastering energy networks, logistics networks, advanced tools, political processes, in order to dominate their sphere of influence. By the age of the Antonines, around Trajan, Hadrian, Marcus Aurelius  this is like 100 years, its a golden age of Rome  its like 90 A.D. to 180 A.D., the average life expectancy of a Roman is 72! And so youve got bathes, youve got writing, youve got civilization, youve got sanitation, youve got aqueducts, youve got roads  theyve got stuff pretty well organized in sophisticated machines. And then of course we take a hard left-turn into the Dark Ages and stuff just starts to break down! And its a reminder that nothing is certain  if you miss a key insight, you could waste 1,000 years! And stuff couldve happened a different way  it didnt. For example, lets take the printing press: the Chinese developed printing presses way back, 2,000 years ago. They never really thought to commercialize them, and the Chinese alphabets a pictographic alphabet, so you wouldve needed 25,000 different type pieces in order to have movable type in a printing press, and so they had the wrong language to develop printing presses! The Romans had the Roman alphabet which is an ideal language because you can actually print anything with just like 26 or 50 pieces of movable type, and they had all the knowledge but for some reason  anybody couldve figured it out, Robert! like all you gotta do is walk in your boots through the mud and step on a nice floor and look down, and theres the idea for a printing press! Tracks in the mud! Right? They had paint, they had dyes, and you know, theyre just oh so close, and then they dont hit it, and we wait until whatever, 1453 or something for Gutenberg to work this out, and were gonna suffer for 1,000 years! Its amazing to me how certain things can be just right in front of a civilization and they just wont grab em! Like if you go to St. Peters square to the Vatican and you look at that column  its now St. Peters column but it used to be Trajans column. And Trajans column was put up to celebrate the triumph of Trajan and his wars. And its a bas-relief, a marble relief of the Dacian wars, and it wraps, spirals up the column, has a little staircase in the middle of it, a work of art, and architecture, and at the top, eventually the Roman Catholics put the statue of St. Peter, I guess! And in the ancient Roman times, that had Trajans statue on it! And Trajan is standing there in his Imperial robes, and hes holding his hand up in the air and do you know what hes holding in his hand?", "image": null}

Ill tell you another one that blows my mind! If you go to the Museum of the Native American Indian in Washington D.C., and you walk around, you see theres an entire civilization, I mean theyre pretty much hunter-gatherers, and if you want to understand how hunter-gatherers lived, I mean, the American-Indian, the Native Americans, the way they were when Europeans showed up in America is probably your best proxy for what the Paleolithic man was, I guess. But amongst all the artifacts they gathered, you walk around, you eventually find a pottery wheel. And the pottery wheel, its a wheel in stone, and its got a beautiful piece of pottery, and the sign says, glowingly, Native Americans had very sophisticated pottery and they knew how to mold clay and they used this pottery wheel to do it. And I look at the wheel, and I think, for 5,000 years, nobody in the entire continent thought to take the wheel and turn it this way and roll it? Like, they knew wheel, they knew wheel was useful  I give you the wheel, Robert! But they never invented the wheelbarrow! They never invented the wagon! Theres no rolling stock anywhere in America!", "image": null}

Life expectancy plunges down to 30 years, from 72 years, and a world without technology, if you dont have aqueducts and sanitation and rules like, Dont bring your horse into the middle of the village because hes gonna crap all over everything and youre going to get sick! In the absence of all those orderly rules, then you have just a degradation of the human condition! And we started to crawl out with the Renaissance, and whats interesting there I think is if you look at all of the great cities in the world, all the great cities grew as nexus, as the central node of an empire. So Rome was the nexus of an empire. Carthage was the nexus of an empire. When they lose their empire, they collapse! The only way you generate enough money to make a great city, you have to scrape a tax off of all the energy, all the commercial value, in a large place. A fisherman casts a wide net to capture the fish  thats your empire! The Roman schtick was, Pay us 10% when it comes into Rome and 10% when it goes into the next port and well take 20% or maybe 30% out of the value added or whatever were gonna take. If you go into Venice and you look around the grand canal, you see all these palazzos  theyre all just warehouses! I bring a ship into Venice, I off-load my cargo, and then it goes out the back and it gets barged up and down the canal, and it gets transshipped to a new ship. In that world, each ship ran this route: Venice to Alexandria was one trade route, Venice to Rome was another trade route, Venice to Istanbul was another trade route! Youre at the nexus, youre running these shipping networks, and of course youve gotta bribe the guy in Istanbul, or maybe your son marries his daughter, and thats how you get to come in and out of Istanbul without getting murdered or without getting your stuff stolen. And eventually all the families in Venice intermarry, like I know you, youre my second-cousin, thats how we dont cheat each other! And theres no wayyou cant solve the traveling salesman problemtheres no way you can take a ship from Istanbul to Alexandria to Venice to Rome to Ibiza or wherever I would go  Barcelona  because I would basically get overtaxed or extorted in each port unless I actually was friendly! So the way that works is, you have a hub and spoke system, and theres always one central city, and theres always one set of families or companies, and they intermarry and they trust each other, and they just agree, Im gonna buy wheat for a dime in Alexandria, Im going to bring it to Venice and Im going to sell it to you for 50 cents, youre going to take it to Barcelona and sell it for $1, and youre gonna pay a nickel in tax to the guy on the other end. Youre gonna get your 45 cents, Im gonna get my 45 cents, those guys get paid $1, those guys get paid a nickel. We can play with, Whats the mark up, right? It might be I buy it for a quarter, sell it for 0.50 and you sell it for 0.75 to the dudes that sell it for $1. But invariably, its the people at the center of the network that are actually getting 10, 20, 30, 50% of all the commerce! Which is all the energy! And whats the definition of a smuggler? Or a pirate? The definition of a smuggler is someone who doesnt want to give me half their stuff! So, how do I stop that? I have to have a navy that goes to kill them! So you have the Carthaginian navy stopping smuggling so they can tax half the stuff! And thats why the Romans cant  Carthago delenda est, right?  Pliny the Elder or Cato, I forget which one, said in every speech he gave in the Senate for 20 years, Carthago delenda est  Carthage must be destroyed! Why? Because two people cant shake down the same guy of half his stuff  theres nothing left! If I take half your stuff as a tax, I cant  its like the tax wars! The Carthaginians are taxing the shippers and the Romans want the money! Therefore, the Romans must defeat the Carthaginians! Now the Romans tax you, then they fall, then the Venetians rise! Now the Venetian navy controls the Med. Then youve got  you know, you ever go to Venice, theres this great Renaissance painting, The Battle of Lepanto. And The Battle of Lepanto is when the king of Spain allies with the Pope from Rome, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, and with the Doge of Venice. And those three navies fight the Turks, the invading Muslims from Istanbul  and they beat them! And its the triumph of Christendom! But it gets you thinking: why were they all killing each other in the first place over the Med? And you realize its because theyre fighting over control of the mercantile network! And then the next interesting observation is, youve heard the word Roman Catholic Church, right? You ever hear the phrase, Venetian Catholic?", "image": null}

The Catholic Church in the entire Venetian empire didnt terminate with the Pope in Rome. It terminated with the Doge in Venice! And so that means all tithes, all due, goes to Venice and stops! You cant have an empire, unless the person at the top of the empire is also in control of the religion, because if you dont control of the religion, then someone else takes half your money, you see? Its all about energy flow! And the energy is flowing  by the way, the Pontifex Maximus originally refers to the Roman consul, to the head of Rome! Augustus Caesar was the Pontifex Maximus. So the Romans had eventually the high priest. So the Roman consuls were the high priest of Rome for 700 years! If youre elected the general, youre also the priest. You run all the religious ceremonies. They didnt separate those two! So the church and the mercantile empire and the power to tax migrates from Rome to Venice. When did Venice start to decline? When they lost control of the church! At the end of the day, they start sinking, because you cant afford to maintain those buildings. You cant afford 100-story buildings in Manhattan unless youre the center of a financial empire! I have to basically buy your bonds for 68 cents on the dollar and sell them for 82 cents on the dollar and cut the difference. You know there are a lot of securities on Wall Street where theres only two market makers: theres the one bank and the other bank and they trade with each other, and if youre buying, youre buying at the top of the spread and youre selling at the bottom of the spread. And the spread is 2%, Robert! So if I turn over $1 Billion worth of bonds, Im paying $20 Million in commissions, and theres a monopoly there, and the $20 Million is just flowing into what? Its flowing into the building! My buddy works for that bank and I work for this bank and we drink together and we just kind of joke about the 200 basis point spread!", "image": null}

By the way, if you go to Amsterdam, Amsterdam is a city of canals! If youve ever seen a distribution center, the trucks come in one side, it goes through a very complicated set of conveyors, and it goes out the other side! These trucks come from the manufacturers, those trucks go to the stores or the locales, and the distribution center is a maze of conveyors. Amsterdams that, but its that for barges, before we had machines. Thats what Venice is! Thats what they did in every mercantile center. And when you get to Martin Luthers time, you realize one of the key drivers is theres no way that we can rise or elevate our civilization if we have to send all of our money to Rome! You see this struggle throughout medieval history  William the Conqueror had that struggle, you see the struggle of the Northern European German nobles, and then of course it punctuates itself with Henry VIII, who eventually forms the Anglican church so he can be the Pontifex Maximus, and if the church terminates with the King of England, they dont have to ship any money down to Italy, nor do they have to ask permission to change their alliances and get married and do what they will. Its useful to have God on your side! [Inaudible] useful! And so that drives a lot of stuff throughout the Renaissance and you can say that Northern Europe broke off from the Roman Catholic Church for religious reasons, or you could say the Northern European powers that be created the religion for political and economic reasons, to break off from the Roman Catholic Church! But either way, its kind of a triumph of history that everybodys forgotten that there used to be lots of  why do they call it Roman Catholic if there werent other Catholics? How many different branches of the Catholic church do you think there were? Like, a thousand! They just kind of coalesced over time! But heres the general principle: everywhere on Earth where you see a big city, it was the center of an empire! Paris, London, Hong Kong, New York, Venice, Rome! Everywhere! And by the way, everywhere where you see a city thats fallen upon hard times, thats been destroyed  its empire lapsed! Carthage, Troy, right? You could name them on and on and on! Venicehad an empire, lost an empire. And thats because you cant physically create this kind of economic density. I mean, you go to Paris and you look at the Cathedral of Notre Dame and you look at how much human effort went into creating Notre Dame  there are people that are selling postcards and bottled water in the shadow of Notre Dame Cathedral making money off of tourists, where the guys inherited the concession from his fathers fathers fathers father, and if you go back 10 generations, the concession was 700 years old! They are living off of the vestiges of an empire long past, and now the question is: what are the empires of the future? Where do they form? And that takes us really to the Steel Age, the 19th century, the robber barons and the like, and you can see  with shipping networks, those canals gave way to free ports and eventually gave way to container ships, and container ships totally remade everything and they shifted power to Singapore and Hong Kong and companies like Maersk. And ultimately its a low-energy  its a componentized way to move things around! The most efficient to move anything on Earth is modern containers! By the way, the biggest rage and technology in service today is containerized software via Kubernetes and Docker. Which is the same principle as: put all your stuff in the container ship, and then the container goes onto a ship, they get standard loading facilities into a port, theyve got standard train cars and standard trucks  everythings standardized! And the cost and the transparency of that was cut maybe by an order of magnitude with that innovation!", "image": null}

Standardization once again! So I do have a question about these empires that weve discussed historically: ostensibly the purpose of an empire like this is to basically preserve the walls of the city, protect the peace, honor private property rights within that dominion, enforce contract law, ensure that theres a non-violent means for dispute resolution such that commerce can be conducted fluidly. And you mentioned the Empires of the future  this is something I think about a lot, is that weve always needed this monopolist on violence to sort of honor private property rights within their jurisdiction. But another really interesting aspect of Bitcoin is its kind of the first private property right that is agnostic of government completely! You dont need government to enforce your right to hold private keys! Its like holding physical gold or any other bearer instrument. So I wonder how much that plays into the relevance of an empire in the historical sense going into the future?", "image": null}

The #1 export in the United States is security! Like literally, I can live in Miami Beach and I dont worry about someone shooting me across the intracoastal waterway. And if I was in certain other parts of the world Id be surrounded by 100 bodyguards  so, security! They have that saying about Genghis Khan, they said, When the Mongols controlled all of Asia, a virgin couldve ridden from one end of the empire to the other with a pot of gold on her head and not be molested! The Mongols werent screwing around either! You intercept their mail, if anything gets stolen, anybody gets hurt, they show up with an army and they murder everybody for 100 miles in every direction, trying to make the point: dont eff with the system! Now most of these empires they generally provide this kind of security for their citizens, not always for the non-citizens or the aliens or the slaves or the whatever  the underclass. But they do manage to establish them! [32:57] Bitcoin is security, and Bitcoins #1 value proposition is security! Its security of energy. If energy is translated to money and money is translated is translated into Bitcoin and you store it on the Bitcoin network, youre securitizing your assets in a cloud of  behind a wall of  encrypted energy. And in that regard, it provides an important right and empowerment to the individual! It hasnt quite addressed the physical security element. When do we actually come up with something that will surround your person with a field of repulsive energy. Your own force field! Then you will have accomplished the same thing in the physical domain that Bitcoin does in the virtual domain. But if I secure your life force  money is energy, is life force, money is power  if I secure your power, that can be converted into physical security either by allowing you to travel away from the [threat]. We have the example  Nazi Germany in the 30's  all the Jews had their money locked up in Germany and so the way the system worked is they operated as bankers and they allowed people to launder their money out of Germany and they would take a hair cut of 10, 20, 30% initially, then 50%, then 70%, then 90%, until pretty soon it was like a 90% hair cut to get your value out, and so consequently, people didnt want to leave! And so if you dont have your monetary power or your assets secured virtually, then your physical security is always at risk because you cant leave nor can you protect yourself, right? You cant pay for anything to protect yourself, and you cant get out, or you cant pay to get out! You would think that probably one of the most useful or one of the most compelling use cases of Bitcoin would be if Im a refugee trying to flee a war zone. Because its either that or gold, and the problem with gold is theres a lot of people with guns  theyre gonna take it from you! And at least with Bitcoin, you could pay the guy with the gun half the money when you started, and the other half when you got there, and the worst he could do is blow your head off, but hes not getting the money. Whereas gold, he just blows your head off  takes the gold! So yeah I think its second order beneficial to physical security in a lot of different ways and it makes the world better, but its first order beneficial to economic security! If we think about the Steel Age, these rail networks are another network to deliver energy faster, stronger, smarter, harder! Of course, at the nexus of every transportation hub, theres an economic center, so rail heads  if a great city is in a port, its at the center of a railroad juncture! And a lot of times at the center of the rail juncture you can tax all the trains! So if goods come from Spain into Paris and theyre going to Germany, the French get to take a tax right there in Paris! The rail heads became a nexus. The other fascinating thing about the railroads is they became really instrumental to logistics, movement of armies, and they drove economic and political power. And one interesting example is Winston Churchill when he was like 25, he wrote a book called the River War, before he was famous for anything in fact! He was quite the adventurer  he went off to fight in the war in the Sudan under Kitchener. And the entire book is about the British working to win a war in the Sudan, and they had to take Khartoum  its like going 1,000 miles up the Nile, maybe 1,500 miles up the Nile!  across desert, and why they would even want to do it is an interesting question, but heres the bottom line: the entire outcome of the war comes down to the question, Can the British build a railroad to Khartoum? And if the British succeed in building a railroad, they win. And if they cant build a railroad, they cant provision the army and they cant move the heavy equipment and they lose the war! The entire war  its called the River War  but it ought to be called the Railroad War. Its just about building a railroad across the desert, and at the end of the day, as soon as the railroad arrived, a bunch of guys with explosives and Gatling guns showed up, they devastated everybody and it was not a fair fight at all! Like Gatling guns versus guys with spears and musket loaders  its kind of very unpleasant! And if you read it through the modern view, it doesnt necessarily leave you a good taste in your mouth! But its a reminder that a lot of times, the difference between winning and losing, and living and dying, is via railroads! I think theres a similar story in the American Civil War, if you look at the way railroads functioned. Even the conquest of the continent, the Union Pacific Railroad! Once the railroad crossed the continent  its Manifest Destiny  you think the United States was gonna dominate without that railroad? What is it, 1,000x more expensive to move stuff over land than over water? And Google is very good at saying, We dont do anything thats gonna be 10x or 100x better  I mean its a Silicon Valley trope. Dont bother to do it unless youre gonna break through this 100x! Well all these things were 100x better, but a railroad we take for granted! I give you 5 tons of stuff  carry it from New York to California. Count the amount of energy its gonna take you! Now put it on a railroad car  try again! You think thats not faster? And stronger? 1,000x faster? 1,000x stronger? Something like that! Orders of magnitude. And that takes us to John D. Rockefeller. Before Standard Oil comes along, people are actually hunting whales  theyre getting in wooden ships chasing around in the Indian Ocean to kill a whale, boil down its blubber and make kerosene and burn a lamp! Not a very efficient way to gather energy! So then along comes oil, and oil is 1,000x more efficient way to get energy, and what Standard Oil was, was it was first an energy producer, but it was also an energy storage device! Its a battery! Because the best way to store energy is put it in a tank! It was also an energy network. Standard Oil, they bought up all the  they didnt actually buy the fields, they bought the refineries. They refined the oil, they stored the oil, they bought up all the tanker cars, they bought up all the tanker ships, they locked down all of the networks, and they basically had an energy network! They actually had guys driving around with carriages to deliver their energy to every single retail store. They had retail distribution! They would even give away the furnaces to sell the energy! They did a Jeff Bezos thing. You know  Amazon Prime. People think Jeff Bezos invented it? He didnt invent it! He read the biography of John D. Rockefeller! Rockefeller invented it all! He did it all! He gave away the razors to sell the razor blades, hes the first guy to realize that you have to form a cartel or you have to form some kind of understanding of scarcity. If theres no scarcity, theres so much volatility that the market is chaotically destructive. So you had the worlds first serious energy network there, and its such a powerful network that 100 years after Rockefellers dead, those companies are still around, worth $1 Trillion! Theyre still instrumental!", "image": null}

Like people would  you talk about scarcity. The problem with using a commodity as money is when the price goes up, people produce too much of it! Well so he  it was a very inefficient industry with massive volatility, and so he consolidated it to drop the volatility so that they could standardize every component along the way! So that he could drive to a lower energy level, a more efficient energy system. Ultimately, if you want to look at the human condition  you ever get on one of those rowing machines and you row as hard as you can for an hour, and a kilowatt-hour is hard to come by! You start to think  if I rowed all day long and I was an Olympic-level rower, I think the sum total of my effort is like 29 cents? Like, if you calculate the value of all of your human effort in modern energy cost? A quarter? A nickel  some people couldnt even do a nickel worth of work, right? And you think about where we got to, and we got through to that by channeling this energy, and it must be 1,000x, 10,000x more energy! In fact just a general theme you see everywhere where theres an explosion of innovation and an explosion of vitality, somebody tapped into a 1,000x more energy or figured out how to deliver the energy! Oil was originally all about kerosene and lighting, and then heating, and then of course the automobile shot it up by a factor of 10 and that was the killer app! But if you go on to some other industrial-era robber baron networks  heres an interesting one: Kraft, Hersheys, and Post Cereal. Theyre technology companies! People dont think of em as that! Before they came along, there was no breakfast. People didnt eat breakfast! Kraft and Post figured out how to box corn flakes, and what they did is they stabilized food energy and put it into a container that didnt bleed the energy, that didnt leak energy! If I give you a bottle full of tomato sauce, and I just make it in my kitchen, and you put it in your refrigerator, it will spoil over some period of time. How much? Well, theres bacteria in it. The origin of branding  the Kraft brand, the Hersheys brand, or whatever brand  the origin of branding is I make it in a clean room, hermetically sealed. Everybody has to clean up, scrub down, sterilize, get the bacteria off, I have machines to load the can, to seal the can, to seal the bottle. I stamp it with my brand! The #1 value proposition wasnt, Its good ketchup! Or its good tomatoes or good soup or good whatever! The #1 value proposition is its not gonna kill you! You ever actually make some leftovers and leave it in your refrigerator for 2 months and eat it? Heres a better one: why dont you make something in your kitchen, and then leave it in your closet for 2 months without a refrigerator, because they didnt have refrigerators! Frozen food came along later! And Marjorie Merriweather Post became one of the richest women of the century, a) because her father gave her Post Cereal, and they were able to stabilize starch in a box at room temperature, and then b) because she bought the first frozen food company, and she realized the ability to actually freeze food was gonna be a game-changer! And before that, no one had ever frozen food before! You think theyre not technologists? Its a food energy company!", "image": null}

If I could store it  now its like, its very interesting here, right? Can I take electricity from Detroit and deliver it to you in San Francisco today? No! Can I deliver electricity from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Michigan? Yes! When it gets to you, how long can you store it in your battery? It bleeds 2% a month! Youll probably lose it all in the year. Can I ship food from Detroit to Grand Rapids? Yeah. When it gets there, how long can you store it in your cellar? A day? A week? If the answers 2 weeks, theres no national business there! Theres no national brand! The answer needs to be 3 months or 6 months  now theres a national brand! Now it matters! So these guys that were launching these businesses, they were really launching clean room manufacturing plants that captured energy or something of value. They were stores of value, Robert! A store of value that would not decay or bleed due to bacterial infestation or spoilage. And because of that, the brand became important, just like the Standard brand was important  the kerosenes not gonna explode  its clean, right? Is the gasoline clean? Is the ketchup clean?

Maybe its the first time someone came up with a way to cryptographically brand a security! Which is an interesting idea! Now with regard to businesses, I would say that all of the great businesses, the growth companies, were all technology companiesin their time. And eventually, almost by definition, they stop growing when theyre no longer cutting edge technology companies, right? There are other businesses that are more like rent-seeking businesses, or theyre concessions. The guy that sells bottled water in the shadow of the Notre Dame Cathedral, thats a business  it relies upon political largesse, maybe theres a real estate business, right? I own that real estate, and then I sell you water or lemonade on that real estate. There are those kind of businesses. But the growth companies  Standard Oil was a growth company, U.S. Steel, Boeing, IBM  in that period when theyre growing, theyre a technology company. And that means that all growth stocks are technology companies by definition! You can buy another stock thats not a growth company or a non-tech company, but its probably not a growth stock! In order to grow a non-technology company, you could then make the assertion that youre gonna need to do financial engineering, like roll-ups  like Im gonna buy every McDonalds or every restaurant across the country with debt, maybe thats a way to grow it! Or you need a concession from a regulator! Its now illegal for you  Im the only person that can operate airports in the United States! You can grow that way. I need a concession, a political concession, and I suppose theres a place for innovative marketing, but Im not  if theres not a compelling technology breakthrough, Im just not a big fan of the marketing thing, you know? Except for, if the marketing breakthrough comes about due to technology, for example, I created a company that got famous because Im famous on Twitter and YouTube  thats not a bad idea! Im the best marketer on the new media  maybe that can work. But at the end of the day, those are not gonna be $1 Trillion  you know, in their day, if the dollars debased by a factor of 100, at least, well John D. Rockefeller was worth $300-$400 Million in his money! Multiply it by 100, you know? Multiply it by 200! He got to be worth $1 Billion I think! So he probably was worth $200250 Billion in his money, and that was in a day where you didnt have access to all the deflationary tech services that are effectively free! So relatively speaking they had extraordinary power, but they were all technology capitalists. Its important at this point for us to just look at the impact steel and aluminum through this entire era. [55:43] Carnegie created an empire based on steel, and Andrew Mellons empire was substantially based on aluminum and aluminum alcoa. Steel is an elemental force for the civil engineering industry, and aluminum became that elemental force for aviation! Without steel, really there is no modern city! You build a building in wood, its 2 stories. Build a building in bricks or masonry, its 5 stories max. In order to create New York or London or any great city, you need steel and you need of course, an elevator! Straightforward things, but of the two of them, steel is the harder development. The elevator you can probably figure out  its a counter-weight on a pulley. Whereas steel is iron laced with carbon, and its really hard! How hard? Think about how complicated it is in order to refine steel and shape steel when its molten, and it melts through just about anything you might put it in, or on! If you read any books on steel like American Steel I think by Richard Preston about Nucor, they talk about steel refinery blow-outs! If you actually have an accident in a steel refinery and if the molten steel falls on the concrete, theres water vapor in the concrete! So molten steel superheats the water vapor, and what happens when water vapor gets hot, or water gets hot? It expands! Explodes! Molten steel on concrete turns the entire refinery into a bomb, and it blows up, and it kills everybody for 100 meters in every direction! So technology, or not technology? Harder technology  everybody thinks theyre in a technology business today. Nobody deals with technology thats as dangerous and as tricky as what Carnegie and those early steel refineries were dealing with! Or the DuPonts handling nitroglycerin! Like, what do you think happens when you mishandle nitroglycerin? [58:31] When you mishandle crypto, you lose some money. When you mishandle nitroglycerin, everything gets blown up  again, for half a mile in every direction! And aluminum, again, not so easy either! So these are really difficult technologies, but really elemental, because the difference between steel and no steel is, do you build a 100-story skyscraper? I guess you could say, you might do something with iron, but irons just got problems! Steel is the perfect material for civil engineering! Its cheap, its got extraordinary tensile strength, if you paint it or protect it from corrosion, it will last forever! Literally forever, Robert! In fact, if you build a steel ship and you punch a hole in it, you can weld the hold with another piece of steel, and the weld will be stronger than the original cold-rolled steel. Its that strong! So in the world of strong  this is the strongest of strong materials! Its strong, its cheap, Carnegie figured it out  they built every bridge with it! No steel  no bridges! No bridges  no Manhattan! Think about what happens if you blow up the bridges in Manhattan? Everybody would starve to death! You cant even get the food in fast enough! And of course, you cant hold the skyscrapers. So all modern civil engineering is based on steel. So then along comes aviation, and they try to build a plane with steel  what happens? You ever see a steel airplane?", "image": null}

Standard Oil was an energy network! The railroads are energy networks! By the way, no railroad  no tanker car with energy on it, right? The railroad is the energy network moving the oil around! The airplanes  another energy network  moving high frequency cargo around, and information around. And each one of them build on another one. And then the food networks. The result of all of them is, there are large corporations and huge opportunities for wealth creation, if you get to the node of the network! One last point on the Steel Age before we move on thats worth noting is: average life expectancy at 1900 is 50 in America! It was 70 under the Romans, it was 30 in the Dark Ages, it might have been 3233 in the Revolutionary War in the US. We crawl back up to 50, and then by 1950, its 70! And so probably the most rapid expansion in the quality of life in thousands of years is in this 50 years from 19001950, because of the conquest of infectious diseases! And thats all really a function of discovering the science of microbes and sterilization  understanding that you need to be sterile. And then the second is antibiotics. And those two things together were extraordinary! Antibiotics alone and Penicillin is responsible for the defeat of Tuberculosis, and Tuberculosis killed a billion people! The White Plague! When you caught Tuberculosis it was a death sentence! I think it killed Chopin  it killed all sorts of people! A billion people  more than any war! [1:04:27] And of course, in this particular case, if you look at history books on the 20th century, they give it like 2 paragraphs! If you were weighting the text based on the significance of what happened, something like half of all the history of the 20th century ought to be just about Penicillin, antibiotics, and sterilization  half! And everything else can be the other half! But in fact its not even 0.01%. The only measurable mortality rate in the 20th century is the flu epidemic around 1920 where you could see a blip. You cant see an impact on the average life expectancy of any other event  including all the wars  World War I doesnt register, World War II doesnt register. Its kind of like, the impact of technology, of modern medicine and antibiotics and networks and cheap energy and sterilization and sanitation and [inaudible]. The impact of that so dwarfs every political thing that took place in the century that what you really got is I think its just a small blip in 1920. And that was like, different estimates: 100 million people died, people say as much as 1020% of the population died in that 12 year time frame, and theyre still debating what that is, but its the only event you can see on the chart, and all of the activities of all the politicians and all the ideologies and everything we fought over, turned out to be not as relevant as defeating Tuberculosis!", "image": null}

So good! Were making progress, weve now seen Man rise through Stone Age, Iron Age, regressed into the Dark Ages, and then finally progress into the Steel Age. And this leads us into the Industrial Revolution, to where we are today, which is the Information Age! So I really appreciated Saylors perspectives on this! I thought it was interesting that we take so much for granted today! We really think that all of these modern miracles generated by markets are a given, but if we look at the Dark Ages and realize that one key misstep can send us sliding back thousands of years, I think its a great lesson to deeply absorb! And realize that none of this is promised! And he made the point clear with the boot print, right? The idea of the printing press was evident to anyone who had ever seen a footprint or a boot print, yet for some reason it took us a really long time to commercialize it and realize its revolutionary potential! [1:09:26] Also when he pointed to Trajan, the guy from 100 A.D., the statue of Trajan of holding the globe, this spherical world in his hand in 100 A.D., yet fast forward to 1,400 A.D. and theres people in Europe pre-Columbus that still think the world is flat! Its so interesting to me that these ideas  as power as they are  they can be missed! We can hurt ourselves by not paying attention. And not just at an individual level, but really at a civilizational level. Saylor might call that the fire of truth  when you let the fire of truth be extinguished, society can regress into falsehood. The other interesting point was the Native Americans with the pottery wheel. They had this device for who knows how many hundreds of years, but no one had figured out to turn it on its side. You realize all of the mechanical potential of the wheel! The wheelbarrow, the wagon, even things like the train. They all use the wheel to overcome frictions for terrestrial motion. And I thought that was an interesting example of how some of our most important innovations can just be hidden in plain sight, frankly! And this points towards Bitcoin for me in that so many people know theres something wrong in the world. They sense theres something really deeply wrong in the world today, but very few people understand how broken the money is, and how much that contributes to the socioeconomic problems were seeing in the world over! So in that way I kind of think the problem and the solution are hidden in plain sight, so to speak! In that we need to fix the money to fix many problems in the world. And we got into the discussion about smugglers. So the definition of a smuggler, which sounds like a criminal actor, is really just someone trying to protect their self-interest! Theyre someone that wants to conduct commerce through a port and not give away half of their stuff, as Saylor said! And thats actually where we get the term free port. The term free port means that you can dock there without having half your stuff [inaudible 1:12:06] confiscated. And that leads us to the really important role that gatekeepers have played throughout history. Whatever local monopoly on violence existed, they always wielded that monopoly to extract value or rents or tax from those conducting business and creating economic surplus in their guarded territory. Thats been kind of the name of the game throughout human history, and thats why we have the two adages: Death and Taxes. Anywhere you go to conduct business, youre gonna get taxed, and were all mortal, we all die. So governments have always used the weapon of the law as an instrument of plunder. Its how they generate revenue, is maximally extracting wealth from those that do business in their territory, but its a parasitic relationship, and if you look in the domain of biology, parasites actually dont tax their hosts to tax, that would actually be counter to their own self-interest! They want to extract maximum value, but in a way that maintains the hosts longevity. So its kind of like establishing monopoly profits in the economics sense. Theres a very particular point on the price curve where the monopolist sets their price to optimize their own profits, which isnt enough profits to kill the consumer and force them not to be able to pay for it, and its not a low price like weve seen in free market competition, but its right at this peak point! Which I thought was pretty interesting that we were able to see governments in that light! And thats why history has this distinct pattern of might is right. Like, people have been competing to be the head gatekeeper, and this can be governmental, this can be religious, because it gives them the path of least resistance if you will for extracting value and becoming wealthy. And indeed these were the first people to become wealthy in the world were people that were able to specialize in violence, or just specialize in religion to establish monopolies on local commerce or local police systems. And that points to the intimate relationship between government and religion and you know the defining feature of Western civilization today is the separation of church and state. That was how we have secular society, was a decoupling of those two institutions. And if we look at say a modern city like New York, I thought the point was great that those skyscrapers are constructed from the value that is extracted by financial intermediaries. Saylor gave the example of two bond traders in adjacent buildings driving most of the volume in a market, and they both get to scrape their vig, their 12%. It reminds me of the hotels in Vegas, the old joke is like the buildings arent built by winning gamblers! The nature of being an intermediary is that you get to extract perpetual profits basically, from anyone doing business within your network! And thats what money is, right? Its a network of trust, and thats why the state has always fought to control and monopolize it because it gives them essentially unlimited power and wealth to be able to confiscate that from the entirety of their citizens. [1:16:04] Thats what tax is, thats what a rent is  not a rent like you pay monthly for your apartment, but rent in the economic sense is it is the intermediary or group preserving peace in that area  they get to siphon value off of it for the privilege of protection. And its not necessarily a bad thing! The problem with it is when its priced at a non-consensual rate. When you have to pay 40% taxes to the government and you dont have any bargaining power in that relationship, thats the problem. Thats when you go away from free market competition and towards monopolization. And thats what creates so many problems in the world! And then when we shifted the discussion and started looking at standardized containers, we talked about that standardized container that unites at the back of a semi-truck or that now ship across the ocean. When we started talking about the value again there of standardization  which we touched on a lot of this in Episode 1, when we looked at ancient Romans  when we are able to compress, I guess you could say that protocols and standardization compress confusion, because theres less optionality, so everyone knows the language. Everyone knows exactly what to expect, so youre able to execute actions very quickly and efficiently. And this creates a lot of economic surplus, right? This frees up a lot of time and resources, which are harnessed as well. They can be reallocated to other things! So that is how we collapse fixed cost, is by standardization! And well talk about this more in a bit that the pattern I see emerging is that at the beginning of an industry, its almost as if  if theres not a natural monopoly, theres typically attempted to be imposed a legal monopoly, and this can have some short-run benefit because it establishes standards, but its at the long run detrimental to the market because again the monopolist is essentially extracting wealth from other market participants. So when we looked at empires, I love how Saylor painted that the #1 export of an empire is security! Thats what the US is today  were the imperialist that runs the world, we export security. If you look at a map of how many US military bases there are worldwide, were basically everywhere except Russia and China! And its interesting to me how Bitcoin fits into that picture, because Bitcoins #1 value proposition is security! Its security of your time and energy in a medium that cannot be compromised! As Saylor described that its like a technology  Bitcoin  for securitizing your time and energy behind an impenetrable wall of encrypted energy. So its a very unique tool in that for the first time in history we have a place to put our life force or our wealth that is independent of any political happenings in the world! Its an apolitical money, which is very essential to its value proposition! [1:19:51] Although Bitcoin clearly has a huge relationship with security, it clearly hasnt solved physical security  Bitcoins not a force field or anything like that  it does have some interesting potential implications in that because its programmatic, you could program a payment to be issued to a gatekeeper, half before you pass the gate (whatever the gate may be whether this is a border or anything that a gatekeeper does) and then program such that they receive half the payment after so it can actually reduce the incentives to violence, and increase the incentives to cooperation! So it will be interesting to see how Bitcoin fits into the empires of the future. And then we went into the Steel Age, which steel is just a fascinating thing! Its this raw material for building these networks in a really permanent fashion! Again if we looked at what people are  people are, as I say in some of my writing  were the networked species! We dominate the planet with our wits! Because of our ability to abstract, to tell stories like money, like nation states, like human rights, and that entire thesis is encapsulated really well in the book Sapiens if you havent read that! And our ability to abstract these stories, orient ourselves around them and then communicate about them very precisely and very quickly! Thats what lets us function almost as a single, harmonious organism, which you could say the world economy is! Were communicating with words and prices and shifting the allocation of resources to the highest and best use, at least in a purely free market  central banking clearly distorts a lot of that! And in that context, steel was critical to building out kinetic networks. The railroad, the ability to move people and military assets 1,000x or 10,000x more cheaply across land! Saylor was making the point that wars were won and lost based on the successful construction of railroads. And this drove an interconnectivity of people and cities across land. So its one of these primordial networks for civilization. And behind that were the roads built by the Romans! And that took us to John D. Rockefeller and Standard Oil. I thought the point was great about [white 1:22:58], again before we figured out how to harness oil  oil being this compressed energy source from ancient sunlight. Sunlight thats fallen on the Earth for tens of thousands or millions of years and has been compressed into its subterranean layers that were then able to harness to radically increase our productivity as weve seen in the Industrial Age. Before that, before we figured out oil, were literally going to sea hunting whales, harpooning whales, to harvest their blubber for candlelight! So the productivity  and Ive seen the math on this before, I cant quote it exactly  but the amount of energy necessarily to produce a single lumen, which would be a unit of light radiance going from needing to hunt whales to produce candles to harnessing oil  again it was orders of magnitude more cheap to be able to create light! Oil basically was this, like fire almost, this primary energy network that we were able to tap and just radically accelerate how quickly the economy producing wealth and new things and new innovations! So again if we consider that were channeling energy across our intellect to create new useful things, its as if our intellect hit this new really potent source of energy when we figured out oil! And Rockefeller, he captured the entire value strain. He built out the logistics network, he had the train cars, the container ships, the trucks. Saylor made the point he was giving away the furnaces away for free so he had the freemium model  he was giving away the furnaces to sell the oil, so to speak. And he originated this cartel model of owning the whole supply chain, so he could standardize the industry which I thought was super interesting! Because again were back to standardization where a monopolist can come in and lay out this singular unitary plan to mute the volatility, to mute the competition, which is long term bad, but short term sort of a benefit in that now that monopolist gets to set standards. He can create standards that everyone else will be forced to operate on  if done correctly  forever! He almost gets to be the incipient of the path dependence of the network that hes creating. And so the thing that comes to mind is monopolies serving this function perhaps of muting volatility in the early stages of an industrys development to establish standards which then commoditizes the space and  assuming you can remove that monopoly after its served its function setting the standards  then you let free market competition take hold on those standards, and its more beneficial! Versus, if you just set out in the beginning with pure free market competition, then its hard to get the industry to interoperate well because of the lack of standards! So its a bit of a mind-twist for me, but the old comes to mind, If you want to go fast go alone, if you want to go far, go together. Its as if a monopolistic single unitary plan enables you to go fast, enables you to build out an industry really quickly, even in the Information Age today  I think were very early  and were seeing the monopolists take a big lead, right? Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google. But over time I would suspect that the standards that theyve been setting will start to be opened up to more free market competition, and well see the de-monopolization of this space and with that the declining cost, which then, again, frees up all this economic abundance that Man can allocate towards the next wave of innovation! So its a lot to think about there, but it seems like theres some natural interplay between monopolistic and free market competition! And Rockefeller figuring out standardizing oil led to Henry Fords production of the automobile. And the automobile as Saylor said was the killer app of oil. When we think about the automobile its like, What was invented? We think its just this vehicle of getting us from A to B, but it enabled, all of a sudden, the density of the city, the economic network density of the city to be a reality, because then people could commute into the city and commute out! It created a lot of the pollution we see in the world today. It changed peoples self-identity, right? The car is an avatar of who we are! People often use automobiles today as kind of a status symbol. So its just a total game-changer. The automobile is again one of those innovations that sort of sprung out from the mastering of the oil energy network. I thought it was interesting too how Rockefeller was basically the most wealthy guy in history. Saylor made the point that he was worth over $200 Billion of todays dollars, but Rockefeller died in 1937. The refrigerator wasnt even commercialized until early 1920s. So this is a guy  the richest guy in the world  didnt even have a refrigerator! So if you today have a refrigerator, you in some ways are more wealthy than John D. Rockefeller was! [1:29:16] You know, a little less than a hundred years ago. And that I think is just a testament to the abundance created by free markets, right? Every living generation  assuming were optimizing for productivity improvement  is head and shoulders above the prior generation, even the richest of the prior generation! And then we got into a discussion about Kraft, Hersheys, and Post foods  I never thought about this before! That the business they were in was actually selling stabilized energy! Like, food is inherently unstable, it doesnt keep well, especially before the invention of the refrigerator, and these innovators figured out basically how to stabilize food energy at room temperature! And the value proposition they were selling was that their food doesnt kill you! Which I thought was just great! Its like, again they were technologists! We think of it as food, today its no big deal  we go to the grocery and we buy boxes or cans or bottles of whatever we want  but this was a major breakthrough for supporting larger populations like we have in the world today! It reminds me of the certification function on coinage and bills too, because Saylor made the point  Ive never thought of a brand like this  that the brand was, This food wont kill you! Just like a gold coin stamped by a government or a private certification business was saying, This is 1 ounce of gold! Or this is 10 ounces of silver! Or whatever it was. So its a trust thing! You learn to trust the brand to represent what it says it is! And then also in food, frozen food was a total game-changer, like the fact that we could suck all the entropy out of food and keep it for extremely long periods of time, just allowed us to accumulate this savings of food! We all take it for granted today, but a freezer and a refrigerator? We should just stop in awe of our freezer and refrigerator every day and just think about how amazing it is that we figured out a way to suck the entropy out of food and store food energy over extremely long periods of time! In that context in a monetary sense, we could say that fiat currency is a high-entropy storage device. It leaks a lot! It suffers from spoilage over time, whereas Bitcoin could be considered the deep freeze, the absolute zero of storing monetary energy! It sucks all the entropy out of it, and you know that youll own a guaranteed fraction of the money supply for all time! So that analogy was interesting to me as well. I liked how he talked about food factories being  again they were technologists  they were computer programs written in steel! So one end of this program you put eggs and flour and milk or whatever it is and at the other end of this steel computer program it outputs cookies! That you can then box, wrap in plastic, put it on the shelf and they last for a year or whatever the number is! This is a totally new and unique way to look at food, and consumer packaged goods in general! And in that way they were stores of value, right? Food, this CPG industry was in the business of storing value! Theyre storing food energy as value and selling it, and they were able to accomplish that through hyper-sanitation. So theyre removing all of the detritus and any uncleanliness from the food packaging process, and in doing so theyre able to output a product that was guaranteed to last for a fixed amount of time! And the analogy there to Bitcoin being this hyper-sanitized ledger, right? All of the nodes are all checking, and the miners are all checking one anothers work to make sure its being done consistent with the rules of the protocol, which are 100% open and transparent to everyone! And thats what makes it this ultimate preservation device of monetary energy! So just mind-blowing comparisons between consumer food products and Bitcoin! And in that way, Saylor hit this on the head, I saw the brand, the concept of a brand, in a new way. I used to think a brand was just a companys logo and reputation, but to his point, the brand was the certification saying, This product is what it says it is  you can trust the reputation of this group! Particularly, this food wont kill you! Something thats pretty important! Something that youre gonna eat and put into your body, you can reliably trust this brand that it wont kill you! The producers are trading on their own reputation, if you will. I thought he just hit the button right on the head when he said, In that sense Bitcoin is the best branded asset in history, because Bitcoin does do exactly what it says it will do! Nothing less, nothing more! And theres no element of human corruption that can change that! You could install a new CEO of Kraft foods and he could say, To hell with the customer! Im gonna start putting rat poison in my cheese crackers or whatever, right? He can do some outlandish stuff to ruin the reputation of the business! But Bitcoin is this leaderless institution that just runs the rules of the protocol and it doesnt change, it doesnt bend! So that was just mind-blowing to me, and something that Ill be thinking about for a really long time! Then we got into steel, with Andrew Carnegie mastering this ultimate raw material for civil engineering. Saylor made the point: steel was cheap, high tensile strength, if you paint it it basically lasts forever, so its non-corrosive as long as you seal it off from air and water, and if you damage it and decide to repair it with a weld, the welding is actually stronger than the original weld itself! So again, another one of these fundamental breakthroughs in raw materials that supported higher civilizational advance! Then we talked about aviation. Clearly steel was good for a lot of things but no good for aviation because it was too heavy so we had to figure out aluminum. My epiphany here was that so much was riding on these raw material breakthroughs! Were discovering new foundation elements to society, and theres a lot of upstream consequences that we cant even imagine! When someone figured out steel, who knew we were to figure out cities and then figure out aluminum, aviation, and then say fiber optics encircling the planet, the Internet, YouTube! Its just these layers of innovation and from the point of innovation its impossible frankly to see where its going to go, so it unlocks all this potential human ingenuity to discover all these other things with kind of a cascading effect! So no steel  no city! No aluminum  no aviation! Just those two! Well just stop there! If we had not city, and we had no aviation, how much of the world would we not have today? I mean of you have flown? How many of you have lived in a city? Its really hard to fathom how much just these two raw material breakthroughs have changed our lives! In my mind, it all comes down to increasing the energetic or network density, so were increasing the possibility of exchange. We increased the cost ofthe economic and population density of a city increases exchange within that city, so its pumping out more ideas and innovations. And theres great books on this. I think its called The Serendipity of the City, where it talks about this relationship between the population density, and innovation. The more population density there is, the more innovation tends to come out of it! Then in aviations sense, its about overcoming the frictions to free exchange. Most people more than 200 years ago would really never leave say a 30-mile radius of where theyre born, give or take. Maybe those numbers are wrong but you get the point: the world has opened up as a result of aviation! I mean you can go anywhere in the world now within a day! Anywhere in the world. It used to take settlers in the US, what, 34 months to cross the continent, if you didnt die from disease or whatever! Again it just points towards the importance of free exchange and how these raw material breakthroughs support more network density which accelerates free exchange even more and leads to more and more breakthroughs in a cascading fashion! And the analogy I like there is that Bitcoin kind of is like financial steel, right? Its just the best tool for the job, and it just works! It doesnt bend, it doesnt break, it just is an absolutely perfected monetary technology, and its steel but it also has wings  you can just send it anywhere, you can store it in your mind or in a computer anywhere. So it has all this flexibility too. It could be programmed to do different things, and you can build different features and modules on top of the protocol and you can build higher layer protocols. Its just one of those type of breakthroughs, a raw material/network breakthrough. So just a lot to think about there. Finally we talked about the conquest of infectious diseases which clearly we havent conquered all of them but weve done a lot. Saylor made the point that these breakthroughs are the best amplifiers of life expectancy ever! Curing Tuberculosis, which killed a billion people, that had an immediate impact on the life expectancy curve, which World War I and World War II were just a blip. So it makes the point that technology is increasingly more of a variable on our progress. Its almost like technology is becoming exponentially more important to us as we innovate further! Which gets us into the Information Age. The wars which are more of like political actions  these matter much less in the long scheme of human history. But, theres a distortion in the history books, right? If you go to read history, youre gonna read 99 pages about World War I and World War II  maybe 9,900 pages  for every page you read about Tuberculosis. So theres this asymmetry in terms of how important the breakthrough is, versus how much is written about, which I thought was fascinating! And Penicillin, that breakthrough that increased our life expectancy so much, it was accidental! Again as Taleb would say, tinkering is an antifragile process. So the more entropy or uncertainty or randomness we can introduce to the process, the more breakthroughs we have  that can be accidental at times! Penicillin was a Mycelium or a fungus left in a sink overnight, and something grew on it, someone tested it, someone figured out, Holy crap! Holy cow! This thing cures disease, an infection! And it just radically changed the world, right? One of the most important discoveries in the history of Man  from an accident! So I think it just points to what we need to optimize society for, which is: free exchange and experimentation  thats how we create the wealth in the world, thats how we solve problems, thats how we increase life expectancy! So that was a killer episode! I hope you guys enjoyed it as much as I did! And well see you back soon for Episode 3!", "image": null}

Welcome to Episode 1 of the What is Money? Show! Im your host, Robert Breedlove, and our purpose in this show in general is the pursuit of truth. Were gonna explore many topics in depth, and many of them will take us down to the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole, by pursuing what I call is the rabbit! And the rabbit is that question  that all-important question  What is Money? And this question is a seemingly inexhaustible generator of answers that have continuously reshaped my perspectives on the world. And I think they will for you as well. Our first episode is part of a long series with Michael Saylor. Hes the CEO of Microstrategy. Michael is the latest and arguably the greatest proponent of Bitcoin, and an ally of this space in its battle for truth and freedom in the world. And Microstrategy is a NASDAQ-listed business intelligence firm, so Michael has very deep experience in the fields of technology, network architecture  things like this. And in fact, he was actually educated in the domain of scientific paradigm shifts and the impact of technology on civilization. And ten years ago, Michael actually wrote a book called The Mobile Wave, that depicted many of the impacts that he saw FAANG stocks would have on the world: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. He had laid out a case  an investment case, largely  for these companies, and their dominance in the global marketplace. And clearly over the past ten yearsas we sit down in 2020  those stocks have been stand-out performers and have become in many ways the new dominant monopolies in the world today. So Michael has a very deep understanding of these topics that I think actually predisposed him to gaining a rapid understanding of Bitcoin. And as youll see  or as you may have heard in other interviews  he really entered the Bitcoin space in 2020 and got very deep into the rabbit hole very quickly, in the wake of the COVID global lockdown situation! So Michaels a very intelligent guy, very high energy, very hard working, and I think his acceleration into the Bitcoin rabbit hole also demonstrates that a lot of this trail has been blazed for him. So a lot of Bitcoin maximalists have laid the foundation for others to gain a more rapid and clear understanding of the impact of Bitcoin. In the wake of that as you all probably know  you may have not heard  Michaels firm, Microstrategy, actually named Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. They initially invested $425 Million into Bitcoin, and that Michael personally disclosed that he holds about 17,000 Bitcoin himself, so hes got a lot of skin in the game to say the least! And I think youll see why as we go through some of this! So in this, what were calling The Saylor Series, were gonna start from the first principles of energy, of anthropology, of technology, and really build a solid foundation for really gaining a deep understanding of Bitcoins potential impact on the world. And Michael and I, to craft this series, we iterated on its discussion framework, and we finally arrived at his overarching thesis  which he was kind enough to lay out in very sophisticated form  and he goes very deep on the topics weve laid out here, which starts very early, like Stone Age, and we go all the way into modernity! So this is a long narrative arc thats super fascinating, very interesting stuff, and clearly, it takes us some time to build up to Bitcoin, but the journey itself is purposeful and its well worth it! So we divided the content itself into time-stamped chapters and sub-chapters which weve chopped into a bunch of episodes. Each episode is comprised of chapters, and then two of those chapters are sub-chapters. Well have time-stamps available both in the video bar and in the description to the video. And the early episodes will include a lot of Michael talking  so a lot of him speaking solo about his bedrock thesis on energy, anthropology, technology, things like this! And then as we build into modernity and to Bitcoin, it will become much more of a dialogue conversation as we go back and forth about Bitcoin and things of that nature. So I realize this is really long form content, but I assure you, I can promise you, youre gonna find it deeply meaningful! I myself found the feeling of chills at times, there were various epiphanies I had going through this which Ill articulate in some of the outros to the episodes. But this was just dynamite content! And I think its a great view into the mind of Michael Saylor, and it makes a very powerful case for Bitcoin and how much its going to reshape the world. So I promise you that youll find  despite the time it may take you  youre gonna find this extremely intellectually satisfying, perhaps even philosophically satisfying. We go really deep on a lot of topics! So I hope you enjoy it! And I firmly believe the insights that come out of this will actually reshape your worldview! So if this is the kind of content youre interested in, and youre really interested in going deep and getting to truth, I think youre in the right place today! So with that, lets jump into Episode 1 of the Saylor Series here on the What is Money? Show!", "image": null}

And this was that year in both of those ways! Im grateful that our company is an enterprise software company  our value proposition is we ship software to large enterprises to help them think better! And the value proposition is intact, even improved, by all of the changes this year. And our cost structure and our operational systems  the way we operate  were dramatically impacted, and we had to adjust. But I would say, this was the year that digital transformation went from being a bromide or a dalliance, to being something that you really had to internalize!

Id like to jump in, kind of like a first principles look at history, and what got us to today? What got us to this digital age thats changing so quickly? And where do we see it going?

Well I mean the phrase that runs through my head is, There has never been such a thing as a fair fight! Humans have been struggling for millions of years, right? In order to rise, first to become the apex predator in nature, but if you look at our struggle against nature, theres never been such a thing as a fair fight! I remember seeing eagles fly along a mountainside thatll hone in on a goat, and it focuses on a baby goat, not the parent goat  catches it from behind, grabs its foot, and drags it off a cliff, and then backs off and waits while the goat goes bang, bang, bang, and hits rocks every fifty feet and is smashed to death five-hundred feet below, where the eagle circles down, lands on the goat, eats it  leisurely! Nothing fair about it! You know, you feel sorry for the goat, and then you realize, this is not a human being! This is nature! Its not fair! Then you see lions  and its not like one lion chases down one gazelle  its eight lions chase sixty-seven gazelles into a channel with three other lions waiting! And one gazelle is forced to take the right side because it gets crowded out by the other sixty gazelle, and that onebam!  its dead for no reason other than that it just happened to be on the right side of the herd, and theres nothing fair about it! Natures not fair, and when you think about the plight of Man the amazing thing is we actually evolved to be the apex creature on this planet! Now because a single individual, on their own, has almost no chance! Theres that scene in Jurassic Park, and theres the bully, and he just is mean to the little dinosaur creature, some kind of small raptor, and hes like the size of a little dog and he kicks it around, and hes a bully and a sadist! And theres this part where he gets trapped in the parkhes walking and he sees that little creature, and it nips at its legs and he kicks it, and then he turns around and he sees its got a friend and theres two of em! And he looks around again and theres four of em! And then they jump on him and he knocks them off and theres sixteen of em! And then they all jump on him and he fights them off and he gets up and he runs and now theres thirty-two of them! The human beingthe modern American that lives in their world of shopping centers and cars and air-conditioned houses and locked doors and 911 and policemen they can call and feeling safety  they look at nature through a zoo! And they look through the bars and thats nature! Or its in paintings and its all just so romantic! Right? They dont have this view of nature! The view when theres sixty-four of those things  and the horrifying realization that that guy is as sure as dead! Hes a dead man walking  hes gonna die! Theres not a damn thing he can do, it doesnt matter if he has a bazooka, it doesnt matter if he has a machine gun! It doesnt matter  hes going to die! At some point, in the next 48 hours, hes going to fall asleep and theyre going to eat him! And thats the human condition! So when you think about that 3 million years ago the first question is, How did we even make it here? Its pretty obvious that, in that circumstance, if youre alone  youre dead. Youre gonna have to have someone guard your back. And my heart goes out to that Adam and Eve wherever they were  you needed two, three four  you needed a tribe. You needed someone to watch, because when you fall asleep, something is going to eat you! Watch a pack of wolves hunt! The one that kills you? Isnt attacking from the front! Youre not going to get to fight it off! Its gonna be an asymmetric attack from the rear, while youre asleep! And so, the importance of human beings using their brains and thinking is incredibly important! And you start to think about  how do we survive in a hostile universe? We have to figure out how we can get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! And that takes us to the beginning of Man, so if I look back at Stone Age technology and you ask, How do we even emerge from this incredible, terrifying scrum? Theres just key technologies that you decide you kind of like in a hurry! One of them is fire. One of them is missiles. One of them is hydraulics. Theres a lot more that we could talk about, but if we start with fire: fire is like the prime energy network of the human race! It all started for us with channeling energy. Fires a chain reaction where were releasing a latent energy in matter  were converting matter into energy.", "image": null}

How are you gonna do that? Youre going to have to tap into and channel energy! And thats why Prometheus has such an incredible mythic place. Prometheus is to Satoshi as fire is to Bitcoin! Bitcoins a fire! Its a fire in cyberspace! And most people dont realize it, but it has its antecedents, right? And fire came along first, and when you think about what it means  and most people dont necessarily think very hard about it , you always had it  if youre an individual, what can you do with fire? Well, you can start by starting a fire so you dont freeze to death! Thats pretty useful! The fire will scare away the animals. So I start the fire, I can sleep around it, I can not freeze. I can also put it around my camp and maybe like a snake that wouldve slithered in and eaten me will go away. I can scare away insects and smoke away insects with it  thats useful! I can hunt with it! I can start a fire, and I can drive the prey away from the fire. And if Im smart, I drive the prey from fire off the cliff! I wait for them to trip, I go to the bottom of the cliff, I find one that broke its neck. You ever get in a fight with a horse? Or a fight with a hippopotamus? Or an elephant? Its not gonna end well! This idea of heroic hand-to-hand combat is a great idea in the movies! Its an awful idea in reality! And if you went back a million years, you would find that your great-great-great-great-great-grandparent thought you were pretty frickin stupid to fight hand-on-hand with anything or anyone! So I hunt with it  I cook with it! Theres a lot of biologists and the paleotheorists that make a very compelling argument that human anatomy actually evolved because we mastered fire. And when youre cooking something, youre pre-digesting it. And if you pre-digest something, not only do you increase the scope of the foods that you can consume, you also accelerate and you also increase the efficiency with which you can convert that food into calories by a factor of 10:1 or 20:1! And if you can actually metabolize the food 10x more efficiently, your digestive tract shortens, and the energy that your body expends in order to digest food can be redirected  probably to your brain! Right? Animals that dont cook food have small brains! A human being that can cook food can have a very short digestive tract, can eat anythingwere omnivores  we can go anywhere, we can metabolize calories that are very efficient. It only takes us 10 or 15 minutes a day to get all the calories we need! There are animals that have to graze all day to get the calories they need! So fire is critical for that. Its critical for seeing! You channel your fire and you can light up a cave, a camp, a tent, you can light up anywhere. And with seeing comes communicating. You ever travel through the ancient world you see they have all these watchtowers! The Romans built watchtowers! You put a fire in the tower, you can see it for miles and miles away! You create a signal system! A certain presumptive arrogance or ignorance among modern men  we think kind of everything worth doing was done in the past 2,000 years or 3,000 years. I kind of figure 100,000 years ago, people were doing all of this stuff! We might not have the writings of it, but they were pretty smart! So Im gonna use the fire for all of those things and eventually for communicating, but once I figure that out, I can use it for hardening, right? I can cook things, I can harden the tip of a spear, I can use it to work metals  eventually we used it to work metals, and that ushered us from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Fire is intrinsic to all sorts of manufacturing processes. And of course  I give you 1,000 acres of forest, Robert  how are you gonna clear it?", "image": null}

Thats why the eagle drags the goat off a cliff and lets gravity do its work. Instead of trying to fight it out!

I think the one piece that maybe we didnt hit on as much is the intellect itself developed through trade and interaction. Thats how we are more than the sum of our parts is through our cooperation. And thats at the kernel of all economics, right? We have these ideas, we swap them, they become better over time, and we get to energize better and better strategies.", "image": null}

And what makes human beings unique is, as far as I can see, theyre the only animal that plays with fire! And from the point we started to play with fire, we started to evolve at a very rapid rate. Genetically, intellectually, sociologically we evolved. And we talk about the fire of truth and the fire of faith. Its like the keeper of the flame. The keeper of the flame really means something when you have a city, a village, a civilization, a tribe, and youve got a fire and it goes out, you might very well die! You dont want that fire to go out, at all! Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain is a fire! We dont want it to go out either! We talk about feeding the fire of Bitcoin and we talk about feeding the fire of faith and simply being the keeper of the flame. It was an old idea thousands and thousands of years ago. I suspect its the difference between life and death for humanity for a million years! Youve started the fireits all good! But now once you go back 100,000 years youd be running around in 42 degree temperature while its raining on you! Or what happens when it goes to 20 degrees? If its cold and youre wet and the fire goes out, youre going to die! Its not an academic thing  its a serious thing! So human beings harnessed fire and it made all the difference, and then along comes the next set of thoughts. If you can harness fire, maybe you can develop a brain, and maybe youll live long enough to use it. The next observation is: you ever wrestle around with a lion or a tiger or a bear? Pick any animal that you wish to kill  you ever wrestle with a dog that weighs 80 lbs? Not easy! Would you like to fight with one? How do you feel about fighting with ten? How do you feel about trying to run one of these things down? I read about in Runners World, runners want to tell you about how humans were always made to run, because ancient mankind chased its prey and it could run 2030 miles a day, and we just run them down until they get tired! Okay well thats one idea, and maybe we did. But you ever try to catch something thats running away from you while youre hungry around dinner time? I dont really want to run for 20 hours straight until I tire it to death  I have a better idea, which is hit it with a missle! And by the way I literally mean missles! I mean a primitive sling or an arrow, and I think they found arrowheads that go back 100,000 years! Theyre old!

I mean the Balearic Islands like Ibiza they were very famous for slingers. And if you read about them what theyll say in the ancient texts is, the natives of the Balaeric Islands were raised from age 3. Before they could speak they were raised to operate a sling. The sling is about 68 feet long, its made of animal fiber, and you know, you dont throw a baseball  and youve seen highlights, right?  if I increase the lever at the end, if your arm was 12 feet long, youd generate some serious leverage. A whip action! So those slings give the average person the equivalent of a 10-foot long arm, and they practice with those for years, from age 3! You can imagine after 15 years of practicing, you get pretty good! And they werent slinging little light stones or the shit that you pick up on the seashore. Theyre actually forming lead bullets! Everybody thinks, Oh yeah! Bullets are from guns! Well theyre not! I mean, people invented bullets thousands of years before guns! Guns were just the latest idea putting bullets together with gunpowder! The lead bullets probably came along 10,000 B.C. And maybe more, maybe 100,000 B.C.! This is a straightforward idea  if your life depended upon it, you would figure it out. And the figuring out is, you get yourself a very condensed bullet, you put it in the sling. You ever see a good pitcher? A good pitcher can place the ball 90 feet away plus or minus 4 inches? Can a good pitcher hit you in the head if youre standing at the plate? Now imagine someone thats pitching a 11.5 inch lead bullet from 50 yards away that can hit you on the head every time! Because the Romans said they could! So now think about  and this is how bad it is, right? Well talk about this in a bit, but to make the point, these guys could stand 100200 meters off, and from 200 meters off they could actually hit an animal on the head, or another human being in the head. I mean it didnt matter if they hit you on the head  if they hit you on the torso theyre gonna rupture your ribs and you may have organ failure! Theres even stories  Livy, when he writes about the Second Punic War, he writes about Roman slingers, and they sling so many of these things that they pretty much break all the bones of the Gauls beneath their armor! Theyre wearing leather armor  their ribs are broken. And if theyre not wearing leather armor and they get hit, just like getting hit with a bullet in your helmet it may still give you a concussion. It was never a fair fight! Try taking your 8-foot long spear and having a fair fight with a wolf or a pack of wolves? No. A bear? No. Humanity wouldnt be here if we hunted or defended ourselves using spears or using  these close quarter swords and clubs  theyre all very romantic and they film well in Hollywood movies, in gladatorial combat because youve got the two adversaries that are in the same frame, but if you go back a million years, the adversaries were never in the same frame! If you made it this far and you were a human being, you mastered the art of death from above! I mean, killed from a distance and nobody knew that you were there! Not a modern invention. Not only would you stand back 50 meters or 100 meters, you would stand up  and by the way, you would be up at the top of the hill where you have gravity working for you  that gives you more range. You would be back. If you were really smart, Robert, if I told you theres a bunch of whatever creature on the plain and any one of them can eat or trample you, wouldnt you like to stand up 20 feet on a cliff that they cannot run up? Stand up 20 feet above them, wait for them to come by, blast them either with a sling or use a bow and arrow, and if you miss  what happens if you miss?", "image": null}

If youre going to dominate, how do you deliver force harder, faster, stronger, smarter? And I could think of a hundred examples in history and they all  you tend to see those things, so if its got the characteristic that it can be made harder, smarter, stronger, faster, theres something compelling about it! Thats why digital gold is thousands of times better than gold! Because youve got all those dimensions to work on! Thats why the natural creature  gold is a rock, a bear is a bear, a mastodon is a mastodon. Theyre not getting harder, faster, stronger, smarter, theyre just doing what they do! Human beings are! But only because of innovation! So missiles are just a tool but theyre illustrative. Fire is an energy network and an energy source! Its a battery. An energy source and you can deliver it in a certain way. And then that takes us to hydraulics, which is power from water, and water is a network. And we talk about elemental forces: fire and water. Well, you ever look at the ocean, and what the ocean does  wave action is incredible energy. But another source of energy is buoyancy. You every try to pick up a 2,000 lb weight and carry it on your back, up a hill? Or just across! Put a 2,000 lb weight on a carriage, put it on the back of a donkey, drag it onto skids  problem, right? And this particular case cant be solved with fire, we cant easily burn it! On the other hand, if you needed to move 2,000 lbs you put it on a barge, you put it in the water, and the water pushes back 2,000 lbs, and I can push it with one hand! And the mastery of hydraulics is fascinating! I went to MIT. MITs mascot is a beaver! And we have rings that have the beaver on em, and we talk about, Why have you got a beaver? The answer is, the beaver is natures engineer! And the beaver is this near-sighted, short, waddling creature. It shows up, looks around, sees the water flowing. It can just be what, bobcat bait or whatever, their dinner, or it can do something about it! And what the beaver does it just pretty unbelievable! The beaver starts chopping down trees! First the beaver figures out where to chop down the trees, then the beaver chops down the trees, then the beaver turns the tree into a dam, then the beaver channels the river into the dam, creates a pond, floods the pond. Its like its reading the terrain! After its got the pond it creates a lodge in the middle of the pond with an entrance underwater, and then it creates its life in that lodge. That pond-water  water is elemental to life, and that pond creates a vibrant ecosystem and in that ecosystem lots of things grow. And lots of creatures benefit, I mean the ecological diversity improves, and its good for all the plant life, the wildlife  people lament the loss if the beaver screws up forests, and the beaver is just doing its thing and if theres a storm and the dam gets messed up, the beaver swims out in the middle of the thunderstorm or hurricane or whatever it is and fixes the dam! Its a very industrious creature! And you just sit back and youre in awe. You think, Huh? How did a creature figure that out? And then what does that mean to humanity? Of course, it means a lot to humanity! Ive been all over the world, and Ive been to the desert, Ive been to Riyadh, Ive been to UAE, Ive been to Singapore, Ive been to Miami Beach. People think oil is money! They think oil is power! And let me tell you: oil is not really power, its not wealth. Water is wealth! Water is the key to life! If I gave you $10 Billion and as much land as you wanted in the desert, you cant create life! The cost for you to create a pond in the desert, the cost for you to actually create a park with oak trees  if I gave you $10 Billion and you lived in the desert, Robert, what would you do with the money? Whats the first thing you would do?", "image": null}

So what do they do? You buy yourself a jet, you buy yourself a villa in the south of France. You buy yourself a yacht that floats in the Med. And then you figure out how to live your life, because the cost to grow a palm tree in the desert is $20,000 a year! You want 100 palm trees  its $2 Million a year to have 100 palm trees! You want 4 acres of grass in the desert? You have $100 Million a year? For 10 acres of grass? By the way, you still cant have it! Even if you spent $100 Million a year to put 10 acres of grass in the desert, the sandstorm comes! And it wipes you out! Water is elemental to life. We underestimate how important it is! Until you start paying to create it. Yeah you can stay alive in the desert, but a person making $50,000 a year that lives in a city that has parks and rainfall and a nice temperature lives better than a billionaire in the desert! Its just that powerful. Now coming back to hydraulics. Hydraulics will generate power, right? I can harness running water running down a hill and create a turbine, then I can create a mill with that  thats interesting. Again back to the hunter-gatherer thing. If you dropped me 100,000 years ago and you said, Okay well Mike, use your brain! Go hunt and gather! Id be like, Screw that! What would I do? I would go find a stream with a little bit of elevation, maybe a mountain stream that had fresh water  you can drink it. And Id find a big enough one that had fish in it, and then I would find a point where I could divert the stream to create a pond  I mean if the beaver can do it, I can probably do it! I would do some digging, I would divert the stream, I would create a lock, and at that point in the year when the salmon or whatever are running I might just flip that lock and I would actually divert the stream into my pond and create myself  maybe its a 100-foot wide pond, maybe its a 20-foot wide pond, maybe its a 300-foot wide pond. Maybe I would waste a lot of the water  I dont care! And I would let 500 of those little fishies get trapped in my pond! Im not chasing after them with the stick like in Blue Lagoon! Theres no such thing as a fair fight! Im not fishing with the hook! My idea of fishing is with dynamite! Im gonna blow up everything in the lagoon, and Im gonna walk and pick up the fish. But in the absence of dynamite, Im just gonna divert the water. Whats the flow rate of water? How many fish swim by you? I want them all! Put them in the pond, then what do you think Im gonna do? Im gonna go pull out one a day! And Im gonna let the other fishies swim around, and if the winter comes and the pond freezes over, thats okay! Im gonna chip a little hole in the pond and Im gonna walk out every day and Im gonna reach in and grab my fish and Im gonna eat my fish and Im not chasing after stuff! When you chase after stuff you twist your ankle and if you break your ankle youre dying! Right? If you chase after stuff and then a wolf pack catches you from behind, or you piss off an angry mastodon. So hydraulic power, its the water, its gonna bring you something to drink, its gonna bring you something to eat. Maybe if Im worried about the little creepy crawly creatures or whatever, Im going to dig a trench around where I live, and theyre gonna have to cross the water to get to me. Maybe I use water  a moat. If I live on the seashore, Im gonna find a natural tidal basin. And in that tidal basin, Im gonna let creatures crawl in! I went to Maine once.

Lobsters are lazy, lobsters crawl into the cage, they grab the food, they get stuck in the cage. They pull the trap up, they find a big lobster, they keep that one. They find little lobsters, they throw them back in because they need them to keep growing.

And it was then and there that it dawned on me very viscerally, theres a reason why all the streets in Mykonos are so narrow that you cant get a horse or a cart through them! Theyre walking cities! Theres a reason that the equestrian class were the Roman knights. The knights were the equestrian class, and what it meant in Ancient Rome was the top 1%, or the top 0.1%. The nobles of Rome were the equestrian class. What it meant to be rich and powerful was: you had the right to bring a horse into the city. Nobody else could! The problem was not that they couldnt afford the horses. The problem is if they allowed anybody to bring a horse into the city, it would be so unsanitary as to render the city uninhabitable! So most ancient cities, if you wanted them to work, you would have to have them human-powered, and now youve got this dilemma of how do you move goods around? Tell me, how do I move things around cleanly? I need a clean energy source that is not going to foul my sanitary system, that its not gonna actually kill me! And of course its a boat! What do you want? You want 25 cities with ports on an inland sea with at least a season 69 months a year where you can cross from one point to another point without being bashed and killed on the rocks. So you need a fairly mild sea, but you have to have water, because if you have the same 25 cities on land and youre gonna use horse or animal power in order to move goods and services back and forth, its just so dirty, so unsanitary, that your civilizations probably not gonna get off the ground!", "image": null}

If you look at all of these empires: the Phoenician empire, the Roman empire, the Venetian empire, the British empire, if you actually tour all the great ports in the Mediterranean  all the really good ones  the story goes something like this. Maybe you go to Bonifacio in Corsica. Well in 1,000 A.D. this was the Phoenician port. And then the Greek empire came along and it was an Athenian port, 500 A.D. And then the Carthaginians kicked them out and it was a Carthaginian port. And then the Romans kicked them out and there was a Roman port. And then after the Romans stole them the Venetians took this over it was a Venetian port. And then eventually it became a British port, you know? Thats the story of Malta, thats the story of Corfu, thats the story of lots of different ports in the Mediterranean. And the reason why is, if you want to dominate the Mediterranean, you need to have a port within one or two days sail that you can hide in whenever the mistrals blow. And if you control that network of ports when the weather goes bad, you go into the port and your ship doesnt get sunk! And if you dont and youre like a week away from a port thats friendly and the weather gets bad, you get dashed against the rocks and you just die! And thats the end of it. So these are all nautical networks and theyre all based upon terrain. And the Mediterranean was a good crucible for the beginning of a civilization. And when you put together the incredible power of hydraulic transportation and then you consider the consequences of not having it, you realize: you cant really develop the economic density. We havent touched much on agriculture. We could but the general theme is the same: when I drop you and you find a fruit tree, youre not gonna go, Oh duh! Theres a fruit tree in this clearing! Im gonna walk 18 miles to the place where I can find a different fruit bush. And then Im gonna walk 5 miles back to the place where the fish are! Youre gonna actually pick up a fruit tree and plant like 100 fruit trees next to your fishing pond! Youre not stupid! Like, paleolithic man theres every reason to believe they were smarter, stronger, and tougher than we were!", "image": null}

So I was trying to get a quick overview and feel free to jump in if Im missing anything, but: it started out with, We cant handle an animal one-on-one. Its kind of our wits that make us who we are! Through our wits, were able to communicate and coordinate with one another. One thing we didnt get into is the Yuval Harari Sapiens thesis where he says that, Man came to dominate the world because we can tell and believe stories! Like were actually able to abstract and represent reality in symbols, and thats what gives us the ability to make tools, and so on and so forth. So with those strategies that are often cooperative, weve energized them with fire as our base  I guess were harnessing the energy of the world and ancient sunlight through using fire  and then the other interesting thing about fire is that it actually accelerated our own evolution, right? Our cognitive development was increased because were able to liberate more calories from food and whatnot. It also gave us the ability to make harder, stronger, better tools in terms of metalworking. I think thats a great point too, is that mankind actually changes his own course of evolution through the conscious decisions we make, like the tools we make in turn make us! Which I think is a really interesting point to touch on later as well with money. And then we had missiles, so we could actually take advantage of our visual acuity, which is something unique to people  and our dexterity  and actually hunt animals at a distance, and hunt them on a terrain thats advantageous to us. Then we had to tap into water, because we are water first of all  humans are 70% water  we have to consume a lot of water very frequently. I think thats the quickest way to die! Its like oxygen first  we have to have that most frequently  water second ", "image": null}

And we come back to this issue being harder and stronger. We harness that fire and we start to work metals and we move into bronze and we move into iron, and I think the Roman Empire is a great model for the way that human beings interact with technology and the way that they interact with a competitive world and become both antifragile and get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! This same thing was going on in other parts of the world, but Ill focus upon Romans for a bit! You go read Livys History of Rome and he writes about the Roman republic had 700 good years! 700 years before even it went to empire! And we started with this idea of Roman politics. Youve heard the phrase, Beware the Ides of March, in Julius Caesar, and people think of it as, Oh, well thats when someones gonna kill Caesar, but its really referring to the fact that for 700 years, the Romans got together on March 15th and had an election, every year! The Romans were the most organized of all of the civilizations we can find in the ancient world and thats how they grew to dominate  they were just organized! One of their forms of organization is  and this is a thing of beauty  theyre running a process where every year, Marh 15th they have their election. They appoint two consuls, they appoint all of their officers. The consuls then, they conduct about 2 weeks worth of religious ceremonies. They all worship, they appease the gods, theyre getting psyched up. Theyre reminding themselves that theyre unique  theyre celebrating! Simultaneously they raise an army. They train the army! We go from March 15th all the way through to May 1st  6 weeks. In those 6 weeks they get organized, celebrate, get excited, wait for a good omen, and theyre really getting ready, and then the campaigning season starts May 1st. Everybody that knows anything about Europe and the Mediterranean knows that the weather gets good on May 1st! The problem before May 1st? It rains, theres storms, if you set out to sea or you set out across terrain before that time period, if the cold doesnt get you, the storms gonna get you or your ships gonna sink or something! Ultimately, in the history of all of these wars, more people die from natural causes than they die from bullets from the enemy! So the number one danger is: natures gonna kill you! So they were all basically doing these summer campaigns. So May 1st they started to campaign. That goes through June, July, August, September  all good months. If theyre still fighting something, maybe around October they wrap it up. They go into winter quarters by November. November, December, January, maybe theyre having November, but certainly December, January, February  thats winter! Theyre not doing anything because the elements are a much bigger threat than the enemy is! And if you know anything about the Med, you cant navigate the Med in the winter! Even in the modern day, no one would want to go yachting in the Med in the winter  its just not comfortable, you get storms, weather is very uncertain! So all this time, theyre rest, theyre recuperating, theyre regrouping, theyre politickingyou can imagine! Theyre discussing with each other whos most suited. That guys long in the tooth, that guys lost his step, this is the up-and-comer  you support me, Ill support you. Theyre working through that consensus back in Rome, and theyre remembering what its like to be a Roman! And then along comes March, and then they decide whos gonna do what  youre gonna be a tribune, youre gonna be a consul, youre gonna be a governor  lets put in place an administration. And theyre always rotating and they go and they do it again! And if they send off the best and the brightest and the guy takes an arrow in the back, well next year theres another guy! Scipio Africanus, one of the most famous Roman generals of all time, he rose to power in his early 20s after all of his uncles and his father died in the Second Punic War. His entire family is getting wiped out, but theres always another Roman! Always another one! From a very early age! And so the political system had a certain elegance to it because it was tied to the calendar  it was tied to nature! It was a natural cycle, and it took into account the need of human beings to celebrate each others successes. I go campaign, I come back, I get a triumph! It took into account their need to have a common faith. The faith is critical! If were not all Romans and we dont all believe the same things, why are we gonna die for each other? Faith mattered! But the weather mattered! And you know, people dont realize they did it every year on March 15th, because if I told you the weathers gonna get good on May 1st and you need an army, when would you start? Theyre pretty smart  700 years of it  thats the Roman way! And then they also took into account human motivation, which is: everybodys got an ego. Everybody needs their turn. Nobody can hog all the power, so even if you were the greatest general this year, youve gotta give it up to someone else next year! And as long as they kept turning  and if Im the second-most powerful family, youre from the most powerful family, maybe Ill support you for consul with the understanding that its my turn next year! And then maybe my family will fight and die for you! Because we have a chance at glory next year! But at the point where you take over and you tell me, Well you think youre gonna keep the job for the next 62 years  at that point, the fabric of the civilization starts to break down, because that equity and that citizenship and that sense that ,Were protecting the Roman way of life, starts to degrade to, Were just protecting someones dynasty  screw them!", "image": null}

But its not uncommon for someone in modern day America to be doing a job and become CEO somewhere between the age 40 and age 65. Not uncommon! In fact, the captain of a yacht will oftentimes be 40 and theyll stay as captain until theyre 65. You might do the same job for 2025 years! I once took a tour of the US military, and I was treated like a Senator! It was an orientation tour, and they would take to an army base, a navy base, an air force base, a marine base, Camp Lejeune, Fort Hood, etc. And one of the things they did is they took us onto an aircraft carrier, the John Stennis. And so I landed on an aircraft carrier and then I got to tour the carrier, and then I got to meet the captain. The average age of the soldiers on the aircraft carrier is 19! Average age! Theres 5,000 people on an aircraft carrier  19! The officers are in their 20s, some in their early 30s. Do you know? The oldest man or woman on the carrier, Robert? The oldest? The old man is 41! So I start talking to em. And the #2 is 38! If youre the #2 Head of Operations, its an 18-month gig, and if youre the captain, it might be 36 months! And so I start talking  and this is a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier! These guys can start a war! Its like 1/12 of the firepower of the US Navy.

Youre talking about a 21-year old lieutenant coming out of the naval academy saying, These people signed up to commit their life and their career and potentially sacrifice their life to be a navy officer!

And theres a certain submission to nature and the organism is greater than any one individual and any one family. Its continually refreshing itself! We have to have a constant flow of new talent, new leadership. Someone drops the baton, someone else picks up the baton! Thats what made the Romans great! They suffered no kings among them! You look at the Second Punic War and then maybe it was the Second Macedonian War? Eventually the Romans went to fight against Philip of Macedon. He was a king! And he had an awful son, and his one son got fighting with his other son, and convinced the father to murder the second son, and then the father realized that hed made a mistake because his first son lied to him!

No apologies about it, from age 3, this is the way it is! And Rome comes first, and everybody elses interests are subjugated! And when you look at that, they started with that system  a good system!  I mean people forget about it! 700 years as a republic! Find me another republic that lasted 700 years [inaudible]. Then youve got the Roman army, and that tells a different story. The Roman army takes us back to this issue of, There was never such thing as a fair fight. The Romans werent fighting fair! They wouldve laughed at you! The Roman approach to this was to take my illustration of the slinger on the cliff and take it to a whole new level! The Romans manufactured ballistas, catapults, every sword and shield to be the same length, every soldier took the same step the same length, everything was the same! You could be an 8-foot tall goliath, and the Roman 5' 10\" tall normal dude is gonna beat the crap out of you because youre not gonna get within 12 feet of him because youre gonna take a spear in the gut from the 12 guys standing to his left and his right as you charge! In all of these time periods, all of these wars, and you read Livy and he describes them very in depth, over and over again: hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of battles, and they always consisted of the Romans maneuvered to get the high ground, the Romans maneuvered to get the enemy out on the plain, the Romans unleashed the artillery onto the enemy while they stood and obliterated 10% of them. Then the Romans unleashed some more artillery! Theres one story where the Roman army cornered the Gauls. The Gauls are on a mountaintop, on a hillside, and the Romans are below  they just surround them, they stop, they start to pummel them, and they rain down hell from above  bullets, boulders, napalm, and Livy writes, Before a Roman even took a step toward the enemy line, half of the Gauls were dead and 80% of them had been maimed or incapacitated from the bullets. And then the Romans start to move up and do something! Its like, theres none of this, Lets just charge into battle and fight it out with our sword, right? Never happened that way! It was always going to be: find a way to get an advantage. And by the way, the technology is very critical! The Romans had a military industrial complex. Theres a way to do it, youre gonna do it in a certain way. They had an entire body language, and entire system of how youre going to act. If you want something which is eye-opening, theres this story of the Roman navy from the First Punic War. The Carthaginians dominate the Mediterranean, the Romans are a land power. The Romans dont know anything about naval power  but it tells you a lot about the Roman psyche and intellect. The Romans are getting beat up by the Carthaginians because the Carthaginians control the ports and they have the fleet. The Romans have no fleet! One day, a storm kicks up, and the storm drives a Carthaginian naval ship into a Roman port  its blown into the port by a bad mistral. The Romans capture it! They take it apart to try to figure out how the Carthaginians make their ships. You cant make this up! This is the most amazing thing in history! They find out that the Carthaginians make their ships from a kit from reusable standardized parts, and not only are all the parts standardized, the Carthaginians have labeled each part with the instructions with where it fits and the number of the part. The Romans deconstruct the entire thing, steal the entire blueprint. 9 days later they made 150 ships! You think these guys were screwing around? Theyre not screwing around! Its like, everythings, Oh you know, Im gonna take my time to figure this stuff out. No! War has a way! War has a way of quickening your activity! Bam! Im losing? I find a ship, thats the DNA, thats the formula of the ship  150 ships. To make a long story short, the Romans win the First Punic War and they vanquish the Carthaginians and they become the naval power! Of course, its not that the Romans invented everything, its just that the Romans stole every good idea from every civilization from the Greeks, from the Carthaginians, from the whatever that they crushed! And because they lasted, were able to read their histories! It kind of blows your minds that in 500 years  by the way, you think the Carthaginians invented that? Maybe they stole it from the Phoenicians! 500 B.C., if you want to win wars, you dont just make ships. And you dont just train hard. And you dont just make wagons, right? Roman roads. The Romans had standardized parts, a standardized gauge for a wagon wheel  every Roman wagon rolling on the road is carving ruts in the road. That gauge has to be standardized, you cant just make any wagon, you have to make it exactly the same! For all those people that recoil at standardization, well that Roman wagon gauge eventually became the standard width of a railroad track in Europe. And then the standard width of a railroad track everywhere! So if you want to know how wide a Roman chariot was, or a war chariot or any chariot, just go stand on a railroad anywhere on Earth  the Romans gave that to you! And the reason why they did it that way is because, if you build wagons with different gauges, they fall in the rut, they snap the axle, and thats death! So its like, Henry Ford said, You can have it any color as long as its black! No! You cant have it any way you want it! Its not that every civilization figured this out. Its just that every civilization which insisted upon doing it a different way with different bells and whistles got crushed to death! Theres an analogy with this in the Bitcoin world too! When you come up with a different feature its like, It would just be 10% better, you know, if you made your wagon 10% wider: it would hold 20% more and you would need 10% less and your transaction costs would be less!", "image": null}

So theyre actually gleaning insights from civilizations that had come before them, which again hearkens back to that Yuval Harari concept of our ability to abstract our learnings into symbols like language or whatnot, and then pass them from generation to generation such that the most successful strategies take advantage of the collective learnings up until that point!

Standard sizes, widths, weights and measures. Those protocols matter a heck of a lot! And if you dont have them, its impossible for people to cooperate! So weve talked about money a lot as being essential for civilization to cooperate and allowing us to specialize, but all these other logistics protocols or military protocols are in their own way equally important! Ill make one last point on Roman engineering on aqueducts. The Romans understood the importance of hydraulics, and they took it to a new level. They actually created aqueducts that would bring water from up to 70 miles away to a given city. There are a lot of coastal cities on the Med that are uninhabitable  the natural economic density is really a function of the amount of water per year, so if the amount of water per year is based on rainwater, maybe you can have 500 people live in the city. And if you bring the aqueduct it goes to 5,000 or 50,000. And so the economic density requires the hydraulic flow for sanitation and just to keep everybody alive! So engineering the roads, the aqueducts, its the rails upon which the entire Iron Age civilization was built! And Romans  if anything  theyre engineers! And they elevated engineering, above all! What is engineering? I am an engineer. I think engineering is an incredible honorable, ethical life-affirming profession. The basic credo of the engineer is, I look at nature, and I look at the circumstances that Im surrounded by, and I use my intellect and every material and technique at hand in order to construct a better world for everyone and everything that I love! Thats the credo! Im not going to be a victim of circumstance! Im going to actually change my circumstances with my intellect and that might mean build a bridge. It might mean build an aqueduct, build a road, build a ship  whatever it is, just like the beaver builds the dam, the engineer builds the world! Look at any city where you take the bridge down, and try to figure out how life changes! And its pretty consequential! Ill leave you one more vignette on Rome and then well move on I think to the Dark Ages. I have a holding company, its called Alcantara. And Alcantara is based upon something I saw in Alcantara, Spain. Its a Roman bridge  it stood for 2,000 years! And if you go underneath that bridge youll find a Roman inscription in Latin, where the Roman Engineer whose name is Julius Locker said, This bridge will stand for all time. They took their engineering seriously!", "image": null}

Michaels incredible, hes very deeply knowledgeable about all things: history, tech, energy. I hope you found that conversation as fascinating as I did! And I got a lot of fresh insights talking to Michael, and I love the initial introduction of, Theres never been such thing as a fair fight! So its as if everything in nature is always trying to sharpen its strategy to figure out a better, faster, cheaper way of doing things. Namely, getting food, reproducing, things like that. So I thought that was really interesting, and theres a nice corollary there between ecological strategies an animal might use and a business strategy! Its the nature of innovation as well. So I came to see evolution and innovation as things that are very closely connected! Evolution being kind of the organic form of innovation, or innovation being the inorganic form of evolution, which I thought was super fascinating! Its fascinating to me that thinking is what makes us the apex predator! Its our ability to run these simulations of future action  we can actually spin up avatars and other elements of the situation and think through them before we actually execute, and we can also communicate about it with one another, so we can out-coordinate other animals, right? So even though we may not have the most vicious physical appendages in the world, its our wits that make us men, that allow us to out-compete and be dominate, frankly. The dominant species in the world. On that same vein, another change of my own worldview was how Michael describes that human beings  as far as he could tell  are the only animal that play with fire. And by harnessing fire, harnessing energy, were actually channeling energy across our intellect  thats another way to think about it, is that we create these idea structures in the world, and the visualization I have in my mind is almost like a magnetic field, if youve ever seen a diagram of a magnetic field, there are these field lines that emanate out and circle back in the north pole and the south pole. Its almost as if we could project these intellectual magnetic field lines into the world, and actually channel energy through them to create things and do things! These are the weapons we use, these are the structures we build. Say a boat  weve figured out how to reconstruct the raw materials of nature in accordance with an established intellectual pattern such that that boat now has buoyancy, and we can move ourselves without friction across water! So just a super interesting new way to look at the world! He went into the three primal technologies that helped us build everything around us: fire, missiles, and hydraulics. Fire serves as the prime energy network for humanity. And one thing Ive long thought about is that its common for us to think of energy in different forms. We think of gravitational energy versus kinetic versus heat energy, all of these different forms of energy, but if you really zoom out, I think every bit of energy that we harness on the planet is essentially solar energy, right? So even hydrocarbons, which are very popular today: oil, natural gas  were combusting these hydrocarbons, but what the hydrocarbons actually are is ancient sunlight thats fallen on the Earth. It fed and formed this biological matter: plants, plants that fed the herbivores, herbivores fed the omnivores and carnivores, and all this energy capture basically dies and decomposes, and thats what becomes these sedimented layers of hydrocarbons  of oil and whatnot. So in a way, any form of energy we tap  even if we think its gravitational energy  I mean I guess the Earth does exert its own gravitational energy to some degree, but a lot of it is coming from its rotation around the sun. So most of the energy, if not all that we harness in the world is actually a form of solar energy! The sun is truly our divine father, if you want to call it that. Our cosmic father. And I guess the one other category would be starlight  it contributes a small amount of energy into the world. [1:49:45] For all intents and purposes, all energy is solar! And I think that was a really interesting way to look at things. And when we harness fire, we have this force that is a self-generating form of energy. So once we figure out how to spark a fire and control it, we have a form of energy that can expand and produce and generate itself and we use this for a lot of purposes! How he described clearing a forest with fire, I thought that was a super-efficient way to clear a path of predators, of obstacles. Fire is really good at that! Also, it improved visibility for us at night, because night was our worst enemy before fire. When darkness fell, we were essentially neutered. Were visual creatures  humans rely on their visual acuity as their primary sense, and under the cover of darkness weve lost this primary sense organ! And fire allowed us to re-establish that. We could actually use it to ward off predators, set up camp, it just improved visibility for us in more hours of the day. And its a great example too of how our conscious decisions and what we construct and the things we use can actually shape us! We can actually co-evolve with our conscious decisions! An example of this would be  specific to fire  is candlelight. Before we could harness fire reliably, we didnt really have illumination after the sun went down. So candlelight gave us all this new-found time to stay up late, reading, studying, planning  all these things that help make us more intelligent over time, it created this feedback loop where we discovered fire and all of a sudden fire gave us all this found time or discovered time to continually expand our intellectual horizons even further! Another thing was cooking. Cookings so fascinating! Harnessing fire to cook, were actually predigesting our food. So we liberated nutrients more easily. We reduced the metabolic load on the body to break down food, and by doing that we freed up resources internally that were reallocated to cognitive development. So by figuring out fire we were able to break down food more easily, predigested, and then we freed up energy to become smarter. To figure out more ways to channel that energy across our intellect. So that was just like mind-blowing! And then finally the fire-based signaling systems he referred to with watchtowers flashing signal fires and whatnot, thats like the original telecommunication network, where we could project our intellect farther and faster into the world. We further increased that core human capability for collaboration, because now we didnt need to be within earshot of each other, we could be at long distance! Just to be able to see a signal fire from even miles away, we could communicate certain information, especially when we developed codes like a Morse code we could use by signal fire, allowed us to send information at the speed of light essentially over a relatively long distance! And then the second Stone Age technology that was really impactful were missiles. I thought that this was super-cool because Id never even thought of missiles on the same level as fire or water, but its such a great point because again, back to that original point of theres never been a fair fight in the universe  so the way humans can out-compete in nature is by engaging in predetermined unfair fights! We need to engage in conflict that we know we have an asymmetric advantage so we can preserve ourselves and we can obtain the most food energy for the lowest energy expenditure. So like his analogy, Do you want to go wrestle with a lion or a bear, or do you want to hit it with a sling or an arrow from a hundred yards away! Theres much less energy exerted for a much higher outcome of energy consumption in the form of food. And the slings and arrows giving us the power to deliver force faster, harder, and stronger, its super interesting stuff! And then giving us the ability to really develop the element of surprise in battle! The advantage to be able to select from where were going to just start the engagement  from high ground, ideally, with the sun at our back, with the wind in our face, downwind  whatever it may be, it gave human beings the optionality to select when and where they would engage their prey! Back to the whole Sun Tzu thing of terrain being the primary element in any battle. So a bear is probably the most dominant terrestrial creature, whereas in the ocean, say its a great white shark or something. The bear is gonna whip the shark on land, and the sharks gonna destroy the bear in the water, so its all about the terrain. The terrain is the first order consideration in any battle. And by using missile technology, it lets the aggressor choose the terrain. The third one, we talked about hydraulics. And I thought a lot about water and how clearly influential and impactful it is on our development. We are water, were constituted of 70% water. The old adage 3 minutes without oxygen, 3 days without water, 3 months without food  youre dead. So water is very important! But other than boats and buoyancy in general, I hadnt really thought about the use of hydraulics and channeling gravitational energy, and I thought it was really cool how he brought up the Great Pyramids at least being partially constructed using hydraulics. That they would drill these long tubes or trenches and use the buoyancy of water, its polarity acting as a resistant to gravity and they would use that to overcome gravity and move these giant blocks that they otherwise couldnt! And that led to the construction of the Great Pyramids and these other monumental constructions that we simply could not have completed using raw human power! We again had to use our intellect and channel energy across it to accomplish greater feats than we could using just our God-given capabilities, our physical capabilities. And I love the analogy, the beaver being natures engineer. Its just so fascinating that like humans do have this ability to channel energy [inaudible] across at the highest order of it  clearly, but theres something in nature too where the beavers a great example, that hes actually eating these trees, thats his food, and also hes constructing an environment for himself thats conducive to reproduction. He builds his little fort, blocks the river, creates an entrance under the water, and he has a safe place to mate and raise children. Its as if nature has this impulse to become smarter. So although there is this big distinction between man and animal, theres also a continuum. I think of a squirrel that buries nuts for the winter  hes kind of engaging in a form of delayed gratification. Hes not necessarily behaving like an economist per se, but hes a little bit closer than a purely predatory animal that maybe just eats whatever it can! Or a bird that builds a nest  all these things that nature really is making best use of the gifts that Earth bears. But I think on that continuum, Man is just so far in and thats why were so dominant! I love the example too talking about the moat waters, an effective defensive technology. This points to a lot of history, when America forked off of Great Britain, it was the moat of water  the Atlantic Ocean  that made it so difficult for England to continue to project its dominion onto America, and thats what led to the Revolutionary War, and led to American independence. Theres been a lot of writing! I read a book called The Next 100 Years that made a pretty emphatic case for North Americas geographic situation where we have the Atlantic on one side, Pacific on the other, all of this coastal access makes us a great trading partner with the East and West. It gives us a massive military advantage in that we can deploy military assets into both moats if you will very easily. When he got into the discussion of the Mediterranean a little bit, how it was actually the cities around the Mediterranean because it was the perfect trading ground, a place to move goods and services across water with super low energy. The description of trying to push a block by hand versus putting it on a boat, you can push it with one hand. Once we gained the frictionless or near-frictionlessness of water, the utility of energy becomes super-high. We can accomplish great results with very small effort. So these cities that dotted the inside of the Mediterranean, this created a super energy-efficient network of trade. And thats what became the cradle of civilization! Thats where civilization first picked up, because there was so much economic density resulted from the low-energy requirements of trade within the Mediterranean! Again back to the terrain being primary to any battle, even if its an economic battle, right? Then we got into Romans and how they conquered the Western world, and the insight for me there was that because of the civilizing force of trade and inter-dependency they had, the Romans actually became dominant due to their self-organization. They were the most organized group of humans up to that point in history. And thats why they became so wealthy, and they became so imperial. They created so much wealth and civilization in and around that cradle that they actually started to expand outwards, and they developed methods of doing this in accordance with the seasons. So they would go out on a military campaign in the Summer and they would come back, have their election processes in the Winter or whatever the timing was, and then they would repeat the whole thing again in the following year. And they also adapted this seasonal ebb and flow into their political structure, so they were giving everyone their chance to make sure that the hierarchy that constituted their civilization was being constantly revivified with the most competent people! So they would shed off this leader and let someone else be elected. And all of that thought and political structure is what underpins Western civilization today! That is the origin of the democratic process as we know it today. So just so fascinating to me how deeply connected we are to history. The other thing that came out to me was it was the ancient Romans that realized the value of establishing a common protocol. Protocol being a means of interaction or a form of interaction or a mode of interaction like a language or a rule set that we both abide by. And when those rules are consensually adopted and firm, it gives us the ability to make a lot of things irrelevant. We can kind of both trust the rule set, trust that were gonna play by the rules, then we can just focus on playing the game. Whereas if the rules are messy and we dont know if this person is gonna follow the rules next year or not, or are the rules gonna change next year or not, we cant plan, we dont gain that ability to have a deeper time horizon or a lower time preference, because the rules are mushy! We cant trust one another as well, so theres a connection there between the firmness of the rule set, and the development of inter-personal trust, and the proliferation of civilization, which if you think of civilization as essentially being a lower aggregate time preference for the civilization! The lower their time preference becomes, the more civilized they are, and these things find their peak expression in arts and culture and morals  all of these things! Really interesting to me how all of that just built itself in layers. From the energy efficiency and economic density afforded by the Mediterranean built into this civilization, built into this political structure, built into this military structure, it just really changing the way I saw all of that  such a history lesson for me! These common protocolshe told this story of the gentleman on the aircraft carrier that the potential for everyone needs their turn, its an amazingly potent motivational force for everyone in the civilization! How I relate to that is as a kid there was this notion that anyone could become president in school. And maybe that was just a silly  it is a silly thing, but maybe just the thought of that as a kid seemed to be motivational! Kids are like, Oh! Yeah Ill be president one day and so Ill get good grades, try hard at sports, be good, eat my vegetables, whatever it is! Because theres this incredibly high aspirational goal, you are incentivized intrinsically  its an extrinsic motivation  but I think through that you find an intrinsic motivation to be your best and highest and most competent self. I thought it was really interesting that the Romans zeroed in on that so long ago! And then too, he told a story of the Romans discovering the wrecked ship, and then they reverse engineered it, and then a few months later they built a whole fleet of these things. So it goes back to the concept of to never be shameful to emulate. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. But in a more pragmatic sense, if there is a solution out there that works better than what you have, you cant really be afraid to copy it and reproduce it. I mean thats sort of what the markets designed to do, right? Which gets into why things like intellectual property are bogus! Because you cant own an idea necessarily! You can satisfy wants to the highest degree or at the lowest cost and thats how youll be successful in the marketplace, but the idea of owning an idea gets us really on that slippery slope towards totalitarianism where things like numbers can be made illegal, certain words can be owned. It just doesnt make sense! So I thought it was interesting that the Romans really pressed their military advantage by readily copying ideas from either their enemies or from their forebearers! The other thing there about protocol is he mentioned they laid out these political protocols, but its as if by standardizing  the width of the wheel which has actually been carried over to the width of the track today  by standardizing these common structural protocols, political protocols, again firm rule sets, they were able to increase their productivity tremendously. Again their productivity and output just exploded, and you can think about this even with home construction. By standardizing the one type of screw or a few types of screws for different purposes, you can produce all of these things at a huge economy of scale. So you can produce these screws at very low cost, which would increase the total output of new homes, the one that youre constructing with these screws. Versus, if everyone did their own custom screw, nothing would be interchangeable, it would be hard to do anything at scale, it would localize the economy for screws which would drastically restrict productivity. So I love this interesting connection between protocol standardization and economic output and prosperity. And this one really blew me away: the credo of the engineer that Saylor referred to as someone that looks at their surroundings and makes use of their intellect and all of the materials available to them to construct a better world! I mean how beautiful is that? Its poetic! I think he said at one point, To engineer is divine. Its so interesting to me that thats what we are! We are creative creatures by definition! As an example, ask yourself, What is the purpose of your hand? Its a really hard question to answer, because the hand is by definition multi-purpose! It can do so many different things! It can grip, grab, punch, we can write, type, think, I mean all these different things  we can signal to one another  the hand itself, were equipped with these ultra multi-purpose tools, and I think in terms of humanity trying to channel energy across the intellect, that the hand is kind of the primary output of that intent, which I thought was really a different way to see things for me! Finally, he got into natural law. Which we could define as the right to liberty, property, and life, So the right to be free, to freely experiment and explore so long as you do not tread on the freedom of others. The right to property, which is  property is not the asset itself. Property is the relationship between the individual that spends time investing and recreating or making an asset, and that asset. So if I go out and spend my time building a boat, a system with sound property rights would say that I have exclusive rights to that boat. The area that I invested my time and energy  the thing that I spend my time and energy to create  I have exclusive rights to that object that I can then trade those rights with other self-sovereign people. And thats the flywheel of economic activity! So we can each specialize in a craft, but we can reliably go into the market and obtain other things of value  we can trade our own craft for other things and satisfy all of our wants, but still have a narrow scope of specialization that allows us to become super-adept in that particular area. But that adeptness benefits everyone because were trading into the marketplace. So making the point that societies that deeply respect natural law tend to succeed, they tend to out-compete, because they are voluntary games! If we respect natural law, if we respect peoples right to life, to liberty, and to property, then all of a sudden they willingly embrace that society, theyll work for it, theyll die for it. The principles that America was founded upon are these principles, essentially! Clearly weve drifted a lot since, but thats at the bedrock of Western civilization! And then at the opposite end of the spectrum  as I was saying, America is much closer to today  when you make a market for appeals and excuses, youre likely to get a lot more of both. As Cicero put it really succinctly, The more laws, the less justice. So I think its beautiful how the Romans embraced natural law, implemented it into their society, their culture. I think that became the heritage thats pouring forth to us! And forming the sediment of Western civilization. And I think its incumbent upon us to study this, and see how far weve drifted from say when America was founded in 1776 to where we are today. How much the state has actually become antithetical to this entire process. We have this super over-regulated environment, a vast proliferation of complex laws, and a commensurate downfall in justice worldwide! So I hope you guys enjoyed this episode. I thought it was mind-blowing and were just getting started, so Ill see you guys at the next one!", "image": null}

I was hearing on the radio people talking about all these different things going on and, despite being a high-performing student in some respects, despite being kind of a smart guy or whatever, I had no clue what they were talking about! And that was quite humbling! So because of that I reached out to some people online to get some information on economics, and I was sent  thankfully  basically Rothbard and other ways to the Mises Institute. So I was devouring that all through high school and college, and I think that gave me a very strong if not somewhat heterodox view of money as far as the modern age goes!

It does also paint a generally coherent view of the world, and having that I think is just generally powerful to have because youre able to make rational decisions about what to do! It sets the stage so you can apply it to just about any part of your life. So especially with Austrian economics with its specific ways of looking at things like entrepreneurship, it sets you up for thinking about entrepreneurship in a very broad way, encourages entrepreneurship, encourages capital accumulation and all that. With that, whatever it is someone has an interest in beyond just the economics, it can help you in your decision making  it sets up a good picture of the world to place yourself in.", "image": null}

It seems absurd but its true because you have to get the wood from somewhere, and that requires all of this specialized knowledge of cutting down the wood, etc., then you have the people who have to go get the graphite, the little metal piece, the eraser, you have the rubber of the eraser  you have all of these lines of production that go into this single thing! And so there is a factory where probably one guy knows how to take all of those resources and put them together, but that ignores all of the structures of production that lead up to that point! So what that essay taught me  I mean before I was even done with the essay it just all clicked  what a market really is, its a very expansive set of these structures of production and exchange between different producers and consumers and all of that. Also, because of how complex it is, you probably dont want to mess with it! So it was very easy with those simple realizations to get sucked into the anarcho-capitalist mindset of Rothbard. From there, Ive certainly tried to challenge that worldview a lot, but for the most part its just been sharpening over time! Adding nuance where needed, but mostly just diving into the implications of this and how we can apply it perhaps to our understanding of the historical events and the world around us.", "image": null}

And it was a wonderful group of people and thats where I met many friends who I know to this day! Yeah the Mises Circle was started later on because when youre in these groups there is this kind of understandable pattern where you stick with a lot of basics, because you always have new people coming in to check out the group, so you want to keep it accessible to a wide audience. For instance, when the topic of economics comes up, youll find that a lot of groups like this, its talking about the broken window fallacy over and over and over again. Its like, Thats a good lesson! Its great! Every new person needs to learn that lesson! Theres a reason why its the very first thing in Henry Hazlitts Economics in One Lesson. However, as someone who already knows that lesson and has a deeper interest in the economics, there was a desire to be able to dive in deeper with friends. So a few of us just made an additional group that could act as a reading group and dive into whatever was interesting us at the time!

As soon as you get into Bitcoin, its hard to stop thinking about it! So in a way it did become the Bitcoin circle! The Nakamoto Institute idea did kind of stem out of that, but basically the Mises Circle was where these ideas were first being developed. We were the ones  sorry I shouldnt say the ones, there were other places that were thinking about Austrian economics!  but it was a place where we were trying to take this thing, Bitcoin, that we had all gotten interested in, and try to apply an Austrian lens to it, to understand it through Austrian analysis! At the time online, there was just not that much to go by to think about Bitcoin from a serious economic perspective. So I was like, Okay, well, well just have to figure this out! The good news is that the Austrians pretty much had money completely figured out! So it was really just about porting over what already existed onto Bitcoin. But that does have its hurdles that I think a lot of people have recognized: that not all Austrians have been able to make those leaps!", "image": null}

So in high school you come across Austrian economics, which is not a brand new science. Its been around since the mid-1800s I believe. But you come across it, youre not learning about it in school, you dive into it! I dont know how you come across Bitcoin between 20082012 but you do, and I see the Nakamoto Institute as a natural extension of the Mises Circle and discussion, but, like youre touching on, there is that hinge where youre reframing the conversation, and I find it remarkable that your mind was able to not switch the conversation but switch the framing very quickly upon this new idea! And what Im impressed by is your ability to digest a new idea to you, and decide what it means to you! So I just think thats remarkable and I wonder  for Bitcoiners today a lot of Bitcoiners today they might discover it on Twitter and it still is a very solo experience! And I gotta imagine its quite different to be able to have these incubated conversations very early on, and very interesting and very special to maintain these relationships over this long period of time and still be interested in the same thing! Sort of like, Im amazed when four guys end up in the high school and form Radiohead, and they just happened to meet as children and theyre able to create music together, but also maintain those relationships! Because people change, and your views change, and maybe Bitcoin is this one fundamental thing that doesnt change. But I find it remarkable! Maybe you could just touch on: Has it been a different ride for you? Having that experience  you know in college I used to stay up with friends and we used to talk about things all night! Maybe all weekend! And you can get into things in philosophy and metaphysical topics and esoteric things. I have less time with my friends to do that Im not saying I have less time now.

Now there are actual scammers  I think everyone would agree, including shitcoiners, that there are many for real actual scammers in this space! But the real thing is just, this article was me trying to take the scarcity of Bitcoin completely seriously! And take these implications to the logical conclusions and think about, Well what is the implication of that in how I should view other people in the space? To me thats like, If everyones a scammer, that doesnt mean to have a negative view of everyone! But its more about being able to cultivate the lowest time preference attitude possible! Because if your default is that everyone is just trying to take your Bitcoins, then it sets a high threshold for what youre willing to actually give, which means that you are cultivating serious standards for yourself! And all of this is just very important because there are only 21 million Bitcoins and as weve seen the price since that article has continued to increase at an exponential rate, and you just have to take that seriously! Theres no going back, and I wish there was going back, because I was a college kid up until around when that article was written! Its like, I couldnt even afford Bitcoin when they were super cheap because I was completely broke! So I wish I could go back and be buying $10 Bitcoin! So you have to have that forward-thinking attitude, but not just to tomorrow but deep into the future! So when a person is offering to sell stuff for Bitcoin its like, Well whats in it for you to pay in Bitcoins? Now if there wasnt a capital gains tax on just any Bitcoin spending, then there could be a reason to want to spend and replace because its just like, there are obvious benefits to being able to spend in Bitcoin rather than using a credit card. However as far as pure economics, a lot of people talked about spending Bitcoins as if its this sort of great, altruistic thing that grows the network or whatever! No, what grows the network is its scarcity and Number Go Up, not dis-HODLing! And so youre not really helping, especially if a lot of these merchants are just gonna be turning around and selling the Bitcoin themselves, theyre just suppressing the price  thats all youve done! Whereas if you HODL it, youre helping add  youre helping the value increase, thus on the very margins youre benefiting from Bitcoins growth!", "image": null}

I mean for me, I think the root of this article is praxeology. I didnt know that word at the time I read this article. Its funny you say youre gonna get people upset  youre calling everyone a scammer! So you read that title and Im like, Alright bro! Lets go! Like, how am I a scammer? Im reading through it and Im thinking, Yes, yes, well hes gotta call me a scammer somehow, how is he gonna include me? How is he gonna upset me? And then I think the really interesting part is that you did call me a scammer. You said: Hoarders are scammers! They want your Bitcoin! I said, Holy fuckin shit! Im a scammer! He just got me in here! And Im not mad at him! And I think the reason that  what clicked for me is that it goes to something that Breedlove just said on my show recently or on Twitter I think, but it was like, Bitcoin kind of unlocks the selfishness to selflessness. So its encouraging selfishness to get to a more selfless place for the entire community. But you gotta recognize your self-interest first! Thats what I got through it: Im a hoarder! Im a scammer! I want your Bitcoins! I want them for less than you think theyre worth right now!", "image": null}

Before the show you were talking about growing up Jewish, I forget what Jewish thinker or whatever but I remember I was hearing something about, You cant help others if you dont help yourself, kind of thing. So thats a bit of wisdom that people walk around with and can often forget about it when they demand that other people just be altruistic for no other reason than someone wants some free stuff. But yeah thats a common viewpoint of how free market capitalism, not corporatist capitalism or whatever the heck you would even want to call this hellhole that we have. Because Mises writes about the sovereign consumer. Where ultimately a producer on the free market  he has to be selling to someone, and the person buying things is the person who gets to decide what makes or breaks that producer! They are the real sovereign! You can put a product out on the market, but that doesnt mean that anyone is going to buy it! So if you cannot create something that people are willing to buy, then youre shit out of luck! So in a free market capitalist system, you have to think about other peoples wants and needs in order to even satisfy your greediness! Which I think is a very good thing for a society, because you do have to basically be empathetic of others and think about others needs! And then if you do well at satisfying those peoples needs, you get handsomely rewarded, so in a sense what Breedlove was saying, that sort of selflessness is kind of rewarded. So the only way to be very successfully selfish is to be selfless in one sense of the term.", "image": null}

And then you bring up under the topic of Investments are scams  and this blew me away when I was revisiting this the other day  you talk about, Investments are scams because theyll lead you to believe that you can get a higher return than holding the Bitcoin itself! Despite the economics of Bitcoin naturally making this an absurd claim in the medium-run, in a post-fiat world therell be plenty of investments that have a greater return and risk than holding Bitcoin, but theyll be assets that generate Bitcoin cash flows. I think thats astounding, talking about Bitcoin cash flows in 2014! You know, we look at this in 2021, and the writings on the wall: you can look at something like MicroStrategy and what theyve done with their treasury, and you could just look at the data points of the price of Bitcoin compared to anything else in the market!

And the name of that conversation Rejecting All Forms of Activism, and that was actually maybe ten minutes out of the hour and a half  and I think the whole hour and a half is astounding  and people should check that show out on its own.

She moved to Hollywood when she was young, wanted to get into the movies, never got into the movies, and held that sign for decades. And it was sort of like a running joke in town! And she ends up in the movie holding the sign, and the reference to it is making fun of her for holding that sign! And yet thats her dream! Her dream is to be in the movie, and she got in the movie, and Im imagining in my mind that she doesnt even care that theyre making fun of her in the movie! Its a fait accompli. But to me its the saddest thing in the whole world. Thats what I got across from your conversation with Peter. So what does it mean to reject activism?

There are a lot of things that I think everyone wants to change in the world. Theres certainly things I want to change in the world, its why Ive been interested in Bitcoin and other related topics! But a lot of people have been trained to think that, for instance, going to the voting booth every four years or whatever is the highest calling as far as actually doing something to change the world. Now, do some elections matter? Probably, theres probably like different local elections that people could get involved in, where they can actually have a real impact. I wouldnt discount that!

So theres that but its also the sheer number of people in your voting blocs, you just dont have an appreciable statistical effect! So if thats the case, then why expend so much energy on that one act, as opposed to other things that you can do in your life? People look towards that activity as a way to address a lot of big problems in life, so like, You name the area of their life and someone will tell you how voting for the right person is going to fix everything, or get us put on the right track! Meanwhile, I think theres just laziness in, at the very least, assuming that elections are the be all, end all. So externalize all of that responsibility onto just some ballot thing you throw out. Because I think about the world around us: theres a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities, theres a lot of places that you as an individual can make actual impacts in your community, in your family, and none of that involves having to go convince a bunch of people to fill in a bubble the same way you do! But, it does involve having to do actual hard work, and I think thats perhaps something that people are not interested in doing, and certainly it is hard work! But in order to get anything done in this world, you do have to put in the work! So I find it unfortunate that people hinge so much of their life on politics, without thinking about these other opportunities they can take to improve their station in life, especially when those other opportunities not only will have an effect, but probably could have an even bigger effect than those elections themselves! So I think Bitcoin is just the best example of this, because the Federal Reserve has been a problem since the day it began. It was created because banks wanted to control the money supply further so that they could manage our lives more than they could manage it prior to the Federal Reserve. And its devalued our money since then in a dramatic way, its had all of the effects on the economy that we could have whole podcasts on. So it hasnt been fixed, it was never fixed  for the most part people werent even talking about it! It wasnt even that much of a topic at all until Ron Paul and especially in his presidential runs, where he opened peoples eyes to this! But even then Ron Paul was merely educating  now, I say merely and yet, I think most of the people who hate the Fed, that kind of stems from Ron Paul  so, many thanks to the good doctor for spreading the word and getting us to believe that. Even so, as far as political action  to actually do something about it  thats been at a complete standstill and obviously weve sort of regressed in the sense that the monetary supply continues to increase, there are no checks on the system, were seeing whats happening this week with Gamestop and its revealing a lot of absolutely insane inequalities in the way the monetary and financial system is set up and effectively rigged. So it just doesnt go anywhere! We make no progress no matter how much we might stamp our feet with regards to the fact that the Fed exists and hasnt been audited. But Bitcoin comes along and it comes at it in a completely orthogonal way thats also completely productive, its just like, Okay! Well just make our own! And we just do that! I dont even have to consider the idea of calling a Congressman to say, Hey! Can you uh, think about ending the Fed? I dont have to do that at all! I can just go stack sats! And every sat you stack is at the margins pushing us towards hyperbitcoinization! Now, maybe not to a large extent, but they all add up! Every sat thats going into deep cold storage is pushing us closer to a fully Bitcoinized economy. So because of that, the actual expenditure of energy is going towards a much more fulfilling place. Were actually getting something for the effort that we put in now! So before, I was a Libertarian pre-Bitcoin, Id stamp my feet, I was like, Oh! How bad is it that we live in this world that has the Fed! I dont have that negativity anymore! I dont care! In fact I feel bad for all of the Americans who are harmed by it, but I actually kind of relish the Federal Reserve taking absurd action, because its like, Youre just digging your own grave! So we can actually be somewhat accelerationist on that now! Its like, Yeah! Thats fine! We have our own thing now!", "image": null}

And when Ron Paul ran for president, I saw it in the same way  I was in New York, I wasnt familiar with this senator, and I wasnt listening or hearing the arguments per se, so I just knew that there was a flank senator running from one of the lower states of the union. And it wasnt anything more to me than a flank  an Andrew Yang running, or anybody else, right? And I think Andrew Yangs a bad example here, Im not discussing him here either, but I think hes been more well received than Ron Paul was by the greater masses! Im not saying I receive him well or not, I think more people received Andrew Yang better. And what Im getting at is, Ron Paul was not received well in the north, or in New York, or in my circles. And that precluded me from doing my own research.

People should actually go back and read some of his statements in Congress. He has amazing stuff! I think relevant to Bitcoiners, for instance  they would probably love reading what he had to say about KYC regulations and stuff like that! When that was going on I was not that familiar with him. I knew one or two people that were into him, but there was in particular a moment in one of the debates  I dont think I was even watching the debate live but I think I saw a clip later on  one that I think had a big effect on many people, which was him standing up to Rudy Giuliani with regards to Osama bin Laden and the War on Terror, and Ron Paul pointing out that, You know, they attacked us for a reason, and they stated that reason! Now that doesnt mean that that was a good reason, but we can go and see what was the grievance that they felt that caused this to happen in the first place, and in what ways can that cause a need for self-reflection? And in this case its like, Well weve been meddling around in the Middle-East for so long, it has created a lot of aggression towards the American foreign policy machine and the war machine that has been basically oppressing those people! And of course theyre gonna be mad about that! So it was a great moment  people should go watch that! In hindsight really what that did  that didnt make me a Ron Paul fanboy, it just made me [think], Oh! Hes like a cool Republican! And he was on my radar like, Okay, this is a guy thats cool.

Hes very much an educator through and through. I think his whole life is one of service to the community. His work as an OBGYN delivering babies and all of the stories around that  hes delivered thousands of babies in the Lake Jackson area, including people in need. And his time in politics was also like a means to be able to educate people about these topics that you dont hear about! No one talks about the Fed! Going forward though I was all on Mises.org and reading all about Austrian economics, and I kept seeing the name Ron Paul! Which was very surprising, because he was just like that random old guy that was pretty cool in the election! And I soon found out that all of this Austrian economics stuff I was getting into, he was all into that! That was the whole basis of his entire political platform! In hindsight it was like, Oh! Thats why he was so cool! Because he was spouting this stuff that Im learning right now! And so I came to respect him because I found out he had been a major proponent of the ideas that I was very much getting into. And by the time the 2012 election was happening, if he had become president, how cool would that have been? But, it was more a time for me to use Ron Pauls bid as an education opportunity, to be like, Hey! Theres this candidate  what are the ideas hes talking about? Theyre very important! Lets learn about Austrian economics and anarcho-capitalism! I didnt care so much about the actual politics of it, if that makes sense.", "image": null}

And when I get in on the conversation it turns out that, well, everyone is completely wrong about how all of this stuff works at all! The point is is that the event itself was not impactful on me, but the fallout of it, spurring an interest in economics, was extremely impactful on me. So I would say that 9/11 and COVID and stuff were much bigger events as far as an actual appreciable effect on me, because 9/11 I was quite young, but I certainly remember the effect that it had on the community around me. And COVID had obviously we were all stuck in our homes and stuff like that. I never had to wait in line to go to the grocery store and I know thats very minimal compared to the hardship that a lot of people have but I bring that example up because that was the first thing [where it] became apparent that something it for real different here! Its not like COVID was the first time there had been a scare about some kind of viral epidemic. In my childhood I remember there was monkey pox, SARS, a brief time in 2014 that people thought Ebola was gonna find its way over, so it was not the first time that there had been a scare of a viral epidemic, but it was the first time that it had been a viral epidemic that actually had an effect.

Whats weird is that I dont actually feel that weird anymore! For a long time I was kind of the weird one because, Hey! I think that it would be better to homeschool kids than to send them to public school! I think that perhaps its actually better to live away from a city! Instead of being in the middle of the city. Or I think people should probably have semi-automatic rifles at home for self-defense! I think people should have magic Internet money that they hold for the future! And all these things were a little crazier to say in 2019 than they were by the end of 2020. Now its almost like, Yeah! Who doesnt want to go move out into the country! I mean everyone has had to homeschool to some extent and Im sure many people have kind of seen some of the benefits! So it has accelerated and I think its great! You know I think its terrible circumstances, but I do hope that in the fallout from that, people got shaken out of their norm in a way that can reorient them towards a more positive way of living life! So Im hoping that we can come out of all of these negative events with a better way of living. Thats a little bit of optimism I have.

I get what youre getting at there. Lets dial it back a little bit! Do you think that sovereignty is achievable at some individual level  youve talked a little bit about this where were a ways away from an individual being able to accumulate enough capital to take on the state and be sovereign. But in terms of, you can stack sats! You can be 100% Bitcoin! But, youre gonna get taxed if you spend and replace, most of society is still operating on fiat and central banking usury, and now the government I feel is  and whether its on its last legs or not as Alex Svetski believes  its sort of rearing its ugly head and involving itself more in our lives. And I feel more restrictions and more externalities than ever since Ive been involved with Bitcoin. Bitcoin gave me a lot of that freedom in my mind and a way to put myself out of circumstances I didnt want to deal with! Kind of like what you were talking about  why fix this field? If this field is horrible, lets go find another field and farm that land! I dont have to spend my life making this field better!

Like theres just a rat race! I look around and theres a lot of people that are in a rat race that Im not quite as concerned about! For instance like having to be able to save money and then go an invest it or whatever. I feel like having Bitcoin in a portfolio helps slow that down. Its like, Well! You have your Bitcoin! You have this thing for the future! You dont have to be constantly looking for get rich quick schemes, which a lot of millennials seem to do! Which is I think what drives a lot of this Gamestop behavior! Some of the other forms of that  people just want to find the quick way out because its the only way out! So Bitcoin kind of fixes that rat race a bit because even if you just have a normal wage job if you can just put a little bit away each paycheck, youre going to be making a lot of progress, especially as time goes on! We see what happens in four-year cycles! So I think thats going to have an even bigger effect on someone of lesser means! And so in a way thats sort of more sovereignty because its like feeling less constrained by the universe! You dont have to worry as much about where food is gonna come from next week, and you can think more about a long term vision of stuff. And when you have that long term vision and the actual idea of what capital youll have available to achieve that, when stuff like a tax or something comes up  Yeah we can all go on about how taxation is theft  but youll also be able to take that reality into consideration much more easily! Its like, Okay! Yes! Add that cost of doing business, but that wont get in the way of my bigger vision! Yeah I dont know that anyone gets to true sovereignty, but you can always be accumulating that capital to be able to address and build towards those long term visions, even with certain constraints popping up!", "image": null}

Just on that topic, I think what people do need to realize is like, In order to do anything, you need to be able to do something! You cant eat unless youve produced the food! So capital is a necessity, its not  but I think when that word comes up its often in a Marxian view where capital is seen as this being of its own thats above us or whatever. I view it as just tools. Capital is just tools. If you want things, you need capital! You need the tools in order to produce it, you need to accumulate capital so that you can address human wants beyond just whats in front of your face! You dont want to be the person whos living paycheck to paycheck which is what youre doing in the state of nature. Austrians like to talk about Robinson Crusoe economics, meaning the person whos stuck on an island! So you get thrown on a deserted island  when you start out, all you have is whatever berries and fish you can gather day after day. And its not until you start finding a way to catch more than you actually consume that you can start to think beyond, What am I going to eat today? And once you can solve that problem, you can begin to solve a bigger problem. And its only through that process of accumulating those tools  whether its in the form of knowledge, physical productive factories or whatever, but you need that in order to actually, for real, solve the the problem, so you can get to bigger problems!", "image": null}

Maybe with an influx of people or something like that? And it seems like youre outside of town. Ill loop that in with a little bit of, What is your take on the word citadel, and are you in a citadel situation where your neighbors dont matter? Do you have a citadel in your mind, and your neighbors dont matter? Or are your neighbors getting better or worse? How are things going in the neighborhood?", "image": null}

As far as citadels, the original Reddit post that citadels came from was this super-dystopian vision of the world where basically we lived in this Brazilified world where you have slums everywhere and then pockets of very wealthy people and they have these fortified areas to keep out the riff-raff. Like the movie Elysium or whatever  thats how this envisioned it, and if you dont get your Bitcoins then youre stuck outside of it! I dont really think about it like that! I actually think that a sound money economy will be good for everyone, rich and poor! And it will increase the quality of life for everyone whos able to denominate their economic life in Bitcoin rather than a fiat currency. Certainly theres going to be people who were able to buy thousands of Bitcoins and theyre going to be uber-wealthy and I hope they enjoy their many yachts! Although more boats means more potential for boating accidents so I hope they stay safe out there! My vision for the so-called citadel has more to do with what Hoppe describes with city-states, and just having more localized governance! So that instead of being ruled over by a highly central organization that manages millions upon millions if not billions of people, you have localized governance systems that are more in control of their own private lives without the input of those groups. And with that, you then have more of those groups who are having to peacefully interact with one another because they rely on one another for trade of resources. And I think that just turns back the clock a little bit in some ways but also turns it forwards with the technological capabilities. Back to a time  massive centralization of state apparatuses is a new thing. Before the mid-1800s, Germany was hundreds of little nations! And same with Italy, and same with all of these places  a gazillion little micro-nations! And these places will tend to be generally more peaceful because they rely on one another, for one, and theyre also inwardly focused on some things. I would recommend that people go  theres a Hoppe talk, The Advantages of Small States or something like that. Hes gonna do a better job than me at explaining that! But thats more of what I think of with the citadel is more about localized governance so that people can find communities that best serve their individual needs as opposed to what a faceless bureaucracy thinks your life should be managed as.", "image": null}

It was really hard to convince my kids and my wife that I need to go to Texas to listen to these guys talk about this money that keeps going down in value in terms of US dollars! And in my mind I wasnt really worried about the USD denomination because I understood what I was getting into at that point, but it was hard to convince other people! Its like Im telling them, I want to go vote. And theyre like, Yeah. Okay, cool! But maybe this is not the year. And I didnt get to go. And another reason there is it generally takes place on my birthday! Again  Im not gonna be here for my birthday, which is generally when we throw the biggest family party of the year because my daughter was born right after me, so its not even my birthday party and I dont even tell people its my birthday! So I didnt get to go, but Im sitting at home, and, Yo, that shit came across Twitter, and it lit a fire! That was the first time that Bitcoin entered the physical realm for me! Where I felt the vibrations! It felt like the mind hive  the human global consciousness. Bitcoin reverberated with me as an individual before that  I had sort of enlightening moments with Bitcoin, but this was where I was like, Holy fuckin shit!

It is using different persuasion tactics to try to win someone over on an idea, or make someone feel a particular way. Whereas, dialectic is very much like dry debate! Its like, lets look at the facts, lets argue through the logic. Think of an Oxford-style debate! That would be a dialectic! A rhetoric is more like a United States presidential debate where you just get on stage and no ones trying to make a clear argument about like the system of government and, Heres why this not a good way to do things. I propose that we do this because XYZ  its all a bunch of  its a show! And the problem is a lot of people want to engage in dialectic because its how you learn, you have to sit down and really think through things. But not everyone is having a good faith discussion! When youre on the Internet, theres millions, theres billions of people on there! So each one of those people is going to have a different interpretation of everything thats flying through the screenanother problem with that is its a very hostile environment! A lot of people I think theyve finally come to realize this: the Internet for a while had a hippy feel-good feeling to it, where its like fun good times, people are nice, everyones having fun!", "image": null}

You might not agree still, but you have gone through this exercise of putting your logic and ideas to the test. When youre engaging in rhetoric its nothing like that! Its, Did I dunk on my enemy? Did I get someone to feel a certain way? And so youre just playing a completely different game, and its important to know which game you should be playing at what time!

Theres also plenty of good uses too! But he is explicit about, This is not about being right and truthful, this is about winning the argument. And so he has all of these different tactics like, Oh! Your opponent says this? All you have to do is turn it around with this jab and youve totally destroyed him! So its like the art of the troll from the 1800s! You know, these ideas, they have been around for a long timeon the Internet, because theres such a high volume of information, we get to see more of these little argumentative simulations happen in real-time, and so we almost get a sharper sense of them. Thats not to say  I dont want to suggest that were better than Schopenhauer or something, were better than Aristotle  Aristotles gonna be better at dialectic than I am, and Schopenhauers gonna be better at rhetoric than I am, and probably dialectic than me. And Aristotle also wrote on rhetoric  both of these guys are gonna be better at both than me! But, Ive probably seen more argumentation than they have, and so theres been more iterations. So in a way, I would guess that a lot of people today have sort of strengthened those muscles in ways that they couldnt have imagined! And the landscape is Im gonna guess much more chaotic than it had been, and its engaging in much different media, so we also have to deal with like imagery! How does an image come across! Neil Postman in the 80s spoke in Amusing Ourselves to Death, where he was basically saying that television, the medium, totally changes our interaction with intellectual concepts because it sort of turns everything into cheap entertainment! Because everything now is based on these visual things rather than  he describes how normal Americans were going to the Lincoln-Douglass debates, which meant that normal Americans were sitting down and listening to Lincoln and Douglass engage in dialectic for like six hours straight! And they were able to take in all of those ideas! We dont have that landscape anymore! We have like, Heres a funny picture! And you could generate those extremely fast. We get on Twitter and we just have a constant stream of Tweets. Its a very heated battlefield! And yeah, I think if you dont have this attitude ready to understand that people are going to engage in rhetoric, troll one another, be hostile to one another, purposefully misinterpret one another  if you dont have that attitude, youre probably going to have a bad time!", "image": null}

Im gonna just read off a little bit of this: Definitely know when to argue, when to troll. Its important to have echo chambers  it lets you cultivate a group of people who share these ideas. Thats something that I kind of struggled with. I sometimes feel that were in a Bitcoin echo chamber. I was definitely someone who was outside the echo chamber, and the Bitcoin echo chamber drew me in! I saw the Tweets, I dont know how they kept coming across my feed, but I couldnt argue with them, I couldnt refute them! So I do think it feeds out, but it is also about growing the group and giving an opportunity to get good feedback and information from the group. Youre not really talking to the people who you are replying to on Twitter  its for the other people! And its really key to understand that! And you must understand who your actual audience is! I love this: relentless propaganda every single day! Just do it! Pump it out! This is good for Bitcoin, there is no bad news for Bitcoin! We must always anchor on the most bullish position! You should never be afraid to take the possibilities to their logical extreme, and from there work reality into your model with nuance as necessary, as needed, and as deserved. A no-coiner doesnt necessarily need to understand that, Oh we might be going to $99 million instead of $100 million  always give them the most bullish! Their opinion isnt merely wrong its completely wrong  always be bullish! And one of your final  and this really struck with me  trigram memes are good! Think about three-word memes!

So like, you can read someone or play for someone the audiobook of The Bitcoin Standard  you can also just say: Number Go Up! Its both effectively the same thing!

Its because I actually believe in Bitcoin and I want more people to become Bitcoiners so that they can also share in the wonderful gifts that Bitcoin has to offer! So with that, yeah! We need to actually understand how Bitcoin operates if we want to be able to communicate that, no matter in what form we end up communicating that best. So it could be best that youre talking in a very trollish tone sometimes. It could be better for other people to be doing academic research or whatever. But the point is either way, in order to be able to craft the best message whatever that best message might actually be, youre gonna have to actually understand how does this thing function.

I dont just want to be believing things just for the heck of it! I also hope that the people who do get brought inand I think they do!there tends to be this great culture in Bitcoin where once people are brought in, theyre lured in because it is so strange and interesting, and then they themselves find themselves going down that rabbit hole of learning more!

Are these bots? Is this coordinated? What is going on here? Its not coordinated! I mean maybe theres a case somewhere, but by and large its not a coordinated effort!

The reinvigoration of the great American West! And so my final question for you is like, What does that mean to you? The rejuvenation or the vision or the future of the Western Frontier? And the rejuvenation via animal life or carnivory? What does that mean to you? And Im wondering when are you moving to Colorado? Im not talking about borders, Im just talking about expansive land with moutains and hills and buffalo roaming!", "image": null}

I mean look, Im a Texan and so I think Ive always had sort of a  always in that background was a romantic view of the West and frontier culture is very much present in Texan culture! As far as that, I think the whole meat thing is a rabbit hole unto itself, but I think our society is not well aligned with the environment, and I dont say that because I want to take us back to a pre-Industrial society or something like that! I actually think that a free market would be more conducive to ecological sustainability. But part of that is we just see a lot of ecosystems being destroyed and I want to see that reversed! And a less popular opinion  although its gaining in popularity  is that large ruminants are good for an ecosystem, rather than harmful! So the common belief is that cow farts are going to destroy the climate. And so you need to stop eatin meat, we need to end factory farming  all of this stuff. Basically end meat production more generally speaking because it is destroying the environment! But I have the opinion  and people can look into this by studying Allan Savory and others  theres a book that recently came out called Sacred Cow that brings up more of the environmental issues. But basically large ruminants are a vital part of the ecosystem! Because they break down the soil, aerate, which allows the soil to capture more nutrients, they shit, which also brings nutrients back to the ground. Theyre very much part of the actual lifecycle! The animals were there! We followed the animals into America! Not we specifically in terms of my ancestors, but humans as a species followed large ruminants across the Bering Strait and down into the Americas. These animals have always been a part of the ecosystem, and its absurd that theyre suddenly causing a problem, when in fact we can see when you introduce more of these animals and manage the herds well, they revitalize these ecosystems and they can bring back grasslands to places that have completely lost their grasses. You have a desertification of some landscapes, but once you have those animals stomping around and shitting and all of that, you get the grass back, and then its full of life again! So I want to see more regenerative agriculture! Im obviously a big meat-eater and I care more about the ruminants, but also other styles of agriculture for other products can also be brought into a more regenerative production cycle, and I think thats better for humans as well. I think it probably increases the quality. It certainly increases the quality of the environment that we get to enjoy! Id like going out into nature and seeing nature so itd be kind of sad if all that lost its life because weve failed to maintain it through these practices. Anyway, I think people, as far as the buffalo in the American west, I think people greatly underestimate just how many bison there were running around the American Plains! They had herds that were miles wide that would take people days to cross, to get from one side of the herd to the other! These things were just absolutely massive, and they were all part of a thriving ecosystem and I think we can bring that back!", "image": null}

When I went to prep for the show I started from the beginning, and Id almost forgotten how much I had digested of your work, how important it was to me! And I say that sensitively in the terms of like, when I was reading your work in 2019 I wasnt podcasting, I was just consuming writing about Bitcoin, it wasnt important to me necessarily who wrote it or the consistency of the voice from piece to piece. So if I had visited you in March of 2019 and came back in December of 2019, I was linking some of it but I had read a tremendous amount of stuff in between, maybe I had caught you in a podcast or two  or ten  in between. But I was just digesting for the sake of taking it in! And the pieces I do want to focus on which are Money, Bitcoin, and Time, the Tyranny of Time Scarcity, and Masters and Slaves of Money, those pieces are really important to me because Money, Bitcoin, and Time is a piece that stands with I think The Bitcoin Standard and Vijays The Bullish Case For Bitcoin. It takes a lot of those same principles and distills them, and I think in a very complex yet simple to digest way! And when I revisited your work though, I really started to get bigger themes than I had picked up the first time. [02:57] Not only was I like, Youve got a mountain of work! I have it all here all printed out! And Im going through it and Im like, Wow this is a mountain of work! And I still had to read it again maybe two more times, but Im like, I remember this! This is all coming back to me! These are the stories I tell when I try to explain Bitcoin! I just didnt necessarily remember the author per se! So theyre very important pieces to me. So just thinking about Bitcoin and time and money: how is money a story told by humans?", "image": null}

It was actually the first thing that I wrote about Bitcoin, and similar to you I was just digesting for a number of years  about two years before I wrote that piece. I guess I published that at the end of 2018? January 2019. So I had been going down the rabbit hole since the end of 2016, so a little over two years of studying nonstop like you had just described. And that was pretty much a synthesis of everything I had learned up until that point. So actually it drew heavily from The Bitcoin Standard, it drew heavily from Vijays work, and the work of many others. And I tried to just weave it into a case for Bitcoin from first principles. And the first principles being that money is this story told by mankind. You could also call it a social construct, its like a social technology. And something like the calendar, right? A calendar is a social technology related to that which has an interesting connection to time. Probably many of the listeners have read the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari. Harari calls these the imaginary constructs that humanity is able to generate these abstractions or useful fictions around which we can orient and concert human action. So these include money, the nation state, human rights, various abstractions. And this ability to generate imagined orders and fight and die for a symbol, basically, is what makes humanity the dominant species in the world. A gorilla troop can mobilize 150 gorillas or whatever to go to battle, but humanity can unite tens of thousands of soldiers under a flag! So we gain this ability to allocate human energy and socioeconomic across space and time in a more precise, directed, and concerted fashion by using symbols or stories than any other animal in the world. Ergo, we dominate the world! [06:15] So in that sense, money is probably the most important story mankind has ever told! It is the original social construct. And that piece attempts to go through the evolution of money, how its changed over time, and how its actually a tool for storing and transacting time, and you could say time or energy  because everything mankind produces requires time or energy. And another way to think about money is as the most tradable asset in an economy and the most liquid asset, so it represents a claim on everything else. It can be traded for anything else mans time or energy can produce. So it is this timeless story or timeless social construct, but it also reflects the storage of mankinds time and energy in a tradable form.", "image": null}

I think Naval has described humanity as the networked species. And the simple case that humanity is more productive under a cooperative division of labor  meaning that theres this kernel to economics called the comparative advantage, which is: you make hats faster than I make bootsyou and I both benefit by specializing in hats and boots respectively and trading with one another. We increase output per man-hour of hats and boots by specializing and trading. And we need one another. We are more productive functioning inter-dependently than we are in isolation. Thats the thing! You could almost think of us as a collective organism in a way. We can satisfy more individual wants cooperating than we can living in isolation. And you cant avoid that! Its math, right? All the luxuries that we enjoy today, no man could singularly produce them. Another great book that goes into this is The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley. And he talks about a computer mouse in the first chapter. And he says that there is no individual on Earth that knows how to make a computer mouse! No one! No one can do it! Its this complex configuration of trade networks and specialization and learning and heuristics and tools and resources and technologies that all inter-connect in this network that output the computer mouse. But you cannot pluck any human on Earth off the Earth and put him on a desert island and say, Build a computer mouse! Theres no one that could do it! So we need one another! Social cooperation is the advantage by which we become more productive and wealthy.", "image": null}

Maybe talking about Harold and Louis and the fishing pole. And I just thought that was remarkable where first we had the micro, and I think that was where I was in 2019, just to kind of lead the story a little bit of where theyre kind of figuring out where theyre gonna specialize or spend their time. And when I revisited it or think about it more deeper its really the macro over generations!", "image": null}

So were building  as we trade and specialize, each of the trading partners then gets additional free time. They get the same level output in the same time, therefore they have basically discovered this new amount of time in their day, and they can spend that time producing further or they could spend it in leisure. But if you produce further, then you create more time savings, and theres a compounding effect. And it builds itself in layers throughout history. So the simple example of that which is in Money, Bitcoin, and Time, and this is one that came out of The Bitcoin Standard, is  I gave the example of two primitive trading partners, Harold and Louis. Actually it was named H and L to signify Harold, with a high time preference  meaning hes more short-term oriented  and then Louis, with a low time preference  which means hes more long-term oriented. And both Harold and Louis are alone on an island. They subsist by eating fish. They both start just catching fish with their bare hands. And they can basically spend eight hours a day catching fish with their bare hands  enough to fill their belly for the day. So its a full days work for a full days food, essentially. Louis, having the lower time preference, thinking out into the future of how he can bootstrap himself out of this primitive situation, decides that he can forego eating  he can go a little bit hungry a few days a week  maybe he could only fish six hours a day and have a little extra two hours of fasting at the end of every day, and spend those two hours constructing a fishing rod! And I think the example is, at the end of two weeks, Louis has successfully constructed a fishing rod that now allows him to collect a full days worth of fish in say three hours. Whereas Harold, with a high time preference, is still spending eight hours a day just to eat! So now all of a sudden Louis is saying, Alright, Im catching as many fish as Harold in just three hours of work using this fishing rod. Im full, Ive got enough food for the day, Ive now got this five additional hours that I could spend doing whatever I want. So he could just take that and be lazy! But again, hes Louis! Hes got a low time preference  hes thinking about the future! So hes like, I figure Im gonna go out and build a net, or construct a boat, or all these other tools that help you catch more fish per man-hour. This process feeds back on itself, and then before you know it, its Harold sitting by the river bank spending eight hours a day subsisting on fish. Louis is out to sea in his boat with his net, his spear, his harpoon  everything hes developed  and hes catching not only more fish per man-hour, but fish in the deeper sea so hes catching higher quality fish! Hes improving his quality of life! And then if he passes these lessons on to the next generation, and the next generation is born with all the advantages  all the capital and learnings that hes accumulated over his lifetime  then they can start that process again from the boat! And then this process builds throughout history until you have these giant fishing ships we have that go into the deep sea and lay trawls of net for miles and miles, and bring back millions of fish they sell on the market. So this is the compounding effect that a lower time preference gives you. And this points to the kernel of all economics, which is delayed gratification. Youre consuming less today to create savings for tomorrow. Or to innovate to create more savings for tomorrow. And its these layers of savings that civilization is built on!", "image": null}

When I read that piece I was very inspired by Louis! And I felt like I was Louis embarking on Bitcoin at that time. Now I feel like Im in the middle. At the beginning of 2021 I feel like Im in the middle of that longer cycle where Im the seventh generation of Harold, maybe. And were stuck in this fiat world! The beginning and the after  the beginnings out of my control  and in 2019 I really felt like I was embarking on a much more  I saw a lot more light! I do want to turn to some more of the macro of price signals. Weve talked a little about time preference and the micro, but the price signals  why are those so important in terms of like a unit of account?", "image": null}

First of all I have to define what a price is. And I like to relate this to language, actually. Its kind of like the price signal, you can think of as an economic telecommunications network! So the price is just saying that everythings trading in the world, and so everything trades at some ratio of everything else. A house may be worth eleven cars, or a car might be worth ten hot dogs. Everything trades at a ratio of everything else. These exchange ratios clearly would be very complicated if thats how we traded. Wed always have these barter exchange ratios! So what happens in an economy is  again that most tradable asset which is by definition money  everything gets priced in terms of money. And this simplifies trading in terms of calculation, execution, negotiation, and so what you have there is a mechanism of comparison, and this is similar to language in that words have sense in relation to one another. Theres an argument that you can trace it all the way back to where someone is holding up a rock and saying, Rock, and that word doesnt have meaning in relation to words, it has meaning to the rock. And thats true, but once you further out into the linguistic sphere, you have context and grammar and syntax  all these things are relational. So were deriving meaning from language, based on the relationship and configuration of words. The same is true in our economy: we derive meaning from human action based on the configuration of prices. So people are going into the world staking their time, energy, capital, in an attempt to solve problems or satisfy wants for others, and the game is to generate more outputs than you made inputs. So I put in X time, energy, capital, that has a certain market value. I want to create a product or a service or a piece of knowledge that earns me more time, money, and capital in the end. But all those decisions are guided by the decisions of others. Everyone is competing to satisfy wants for one another over time, so the price is the informational bearer on how much things cost! How much are inputs and outputs worth! So this entire system is what coordinates entrepreneurial action. So this game were all playing where were trying to figure out, How to better satisfy the wants of people? How do I improve human productivity? How do I render value to people? We just define value as whatever people want! So theres a lot of wants out there, and you go out and satisfy them profitably. That is the game of economics, and that game is governed by prices. So that is the informational signal that is propagating throughout the economy. Whats incredible about it is that it adds so much efficiency to decision-making! And the simple example there was, if there was an earthquake in Chile that disrupted the flow of copper, all the market actors in the world  no one needs to know the why, no one needs to know about the earthquake, no one needs to know about the destruction  they just need to see that the price of copper went up! By that occurring, youve changed the incentive structure for all users of copper. So people buying copper will either buy less or theyll seek substitutes, and all the producers of copper will produce more, because the markets bearing a higher price for it! So this market signal is how economic systems coordinate themselves and correct disruptions. So this disruption in the flow of copper into the world economy would be self-regulated or self-corrected through the price signal! And all done in a way that you dont need to sit down with a simple planning committee and say, Hey! There was a disruption to the flow of copper, we need to decide how much were gonna send here and there. The other way to think about this is, the free market is the ultimate distributed computing network! Were all inter-connected by the price signal. Each individual node  which is each individual human or entrepreneur  they have maximal knowledge of their localized situation, right? You know, whatever business youre in, you know that business better than anyone else, and youre communicating information about that business into your market through your buying and selling decisions. Thats constantly reshaping the price signal for others, and the same things happening from all other nodes, so youre getting information back to the price signal. So its a self-organizing economic network communicated through the price signal. So its like the nerve signal of the world economy, is another way to think about it.", "image": null}

So we laid out a little bit about the economic gamification of money and how were networked. But now we need a kind of way to keep score, so you need a ledger! Before we get to Bitcoin, weve actually had an example of a transparent ledger before on a very small scale on the Yap Islands. If you would maybe talk a little bit about how they kept track of money through the Rai stones in a transparent way?", "image": null}

So that was a super interesting ancient monetary system because it most closely resembled what we see with the Bitcoin open source ledger, basically! Rai stones were giant stones, like you couldnt move them by hand, it took dozens of guys to retrieve these things  I think from quarries. And they had a very particular shape. There was a significant amount of work necessary to procure them, which we could think of as akin to the Proof-of-Work that limited their supply. So you couldnt just print Rai stones  that was very important! So they had scarcity in the marketplace. But they lacked some other monetary properties like divisibility and portability. You couldnt move them easily  these are giant, multi-ton rocks. You couldnt divide them easily. So the Yap Islanders kept track of it with an open source ledger, effectively! Everyone on the marketplace would trade, and then when they would decide that part of the stone had been traded for some other good or service, they would announce this  literally verbally announce this to the marketplace  everyone had their own individual ledger, and they would record the trades. So that was a distributed ledger, effectively, that truth was established by consensus, and then no one could go and change their individual ledger and say, Oh this trade didnt happen! Because then it wouldnt reconcile to the others. So its very similar to what Bitcoin does, in that  thats what every node and miner in the world was doing  its checking the work of every other node and miner. Consensus is reached in a distributed fashion! Was that the original question?", "image": null}

To continue that thought, that was hard money at first! Hard in the sense that it was hard to produce, hard to forge, not hard in the sense that it was a rock, but hard in the sense that it was hard to procure, until David OKeefe arrived, and turned hard money into what we would call soft money today.", "image": null}

And weve seen this a number of times throughout history. Another example are the glass beads in Africa. But historically, markets have tried to zero on the asset that best satisfies the properties of money. And we can think about this as the services money renders! We want money that can be divisible, durable, recognizable, portable, and scarce. In the case of the Yap Islanders, they had figured out a system that satisfied those five properties, that provided those five services. However, once OKeefe arrived, he basically technologically disrupted this monetary system, because he had dynamite, he had boats, he could go out and quarry these rocks much more cheaply, so therefore he could compromise the scarcity of the money, and use it to acquire things in the market and diminish the value of the money. And thats exactly what happened! I think it was coconut oil that he was trying to procure from them? And he saw that they were using these stones as money. He realized that he could go back and get some dynamite, come here, mine huge quantities of these stones very easily, and then use it to acquire a ton of coconuts and then you could go sell these back in a different market. And glossing over some of the detail, thats more or less what happened. The Yap Islanders tried to resist initially, but he was able to get through to a few of them. And then the entire monetary system collapsed! So the lesson there is: if someone can produce a money more cheaply than others, they essentially control the monetary system, or they can disrupt it down to the point of the cost of production of that money. And we see a similar dynamic with central banking today. Where theyre producing money at zero cost, confiscating wealth from all users of the money, and driving it into the ground, frankly, over time!", "image": null}

And before we dive a little bit deeper into that hinge on a more specific micro-level  Im curious on your thoughts on how China and India dealt with gold and silver? And moving towards what the world considered to be the standard, and how that might have affected their societies from a wealth preservation perspective?", "image": null}

So theyre good canaries in the coal mine, I think historically, for what we will see for countries and groups that resist Bitcoin going forward. As Saifedean brilliantly says  and Im gonna paraphrase it  history shows that it is impossible to ignore the consequences of someone else holding a money that is harder than yours! So this inflation-resistant quality of money, it is a game that imposes itself! You cant just isolate yourself or your economy or your nation from someone else holding a harder money than you, because what will effectively happen is that theres more demand from a money that holds its value across time, so capital will be absorbed by a hard money economy, making them wealthier relative to the softer money economy, giving the hard money economy the advantage over the soft money economy. And the example there was China and India obstinately holding out on the silver standard while the world was moving to a gold standard, and it just kept playing out! England was I think the first to move to the gold standard, and then the game theory kept playing itself out that other countries realized that they had to adopt a gold standard to remain competitive, and then eventually it was China and India were the two players remaining on the silver standard. And thats why England was able to colonize much of India! It basically became an English commonwealth, because you had English people on a gold standard able to go in and buy vast amounts of Indian capital and land and resources. And then control it for many generations! Similar thing played out in China, but I believe that led to the Maoist revolution, actually. That there was such a breakdown on wealth that they eventually had a revolution. I might be mixing the chronology up there but the moral of the story is: China was economically plundered by remaining on the silver standard relative to countries that moved on to the gold standard. So in a Bitcoin lens its similar  the game theory is: it cannot be ignored or argued away! Its: whoever holds the hardest money is going to accumulate the most economic value.", "image": null}

How much do you think it set back those civilizations till today? If they had maybe gone to gold sooner? I mean dealing with colonization and just the wealth of the society within the society?

I mean, had they adopted the gold standard much earlier I think it would have changed their entire history! They would have been much more powerful and wealthier today. There would have been a lot less suffering between then and now, but as good as gold was, the Achilles heel is that it still introduced the need to trust the custodians. Trust the banks. And the economies of scale associated with transacting  meaning that its very heavy and difficult to move around  so theres a big cost associated with transacting with gold. So this led to the centralization of custody. And then governments  which have the monopoly on violence  they inevitably co-opt the gold supply such that it can become a revenue stream for the treasury. They can just borrow whatever they need! And thats why the gold standard always breaks down and ends up in fiat, in my opinion. Because these custodians  its absolute power corrupts absolutely! You give a custodian absolute power over the gold supply, they inevitably issue more bank notes or warehouse receipts than the gold reserves can justify, and the entire standard becomes compromised over time! Again it compromises scarcity of money by abstracting it in a paper currency. So as good as good was as a force for civilization, this Achilles heel always led to its ultimate abuse and breakdown.", "image": null}

And I ask that from a  obviously we would get more if we collaborated, and I do think reciprocity is a big part of our internal nature!

Im tempted to just cover it at a high level here. So in nature  and this is all organisms  one of the most deeply rooted primordial organic impulses is the territorial imperative. So animals want to take territory, protect territory, and so you could say they seek to expand their dominion over space, but I argue too that  again, as Einstein taught us, space and time are the same thing  it also applies to time. So animals seek to increase their genetic dominion over time, which is reproduction. Were all trying to reproduce and spread genes as far and wide as possible. The territorial imperative of biology is expressed in man as property rights. This is how we determine who owns what in the world. Who owns what space, who owns command over other peoples time. This is all embodied in what property rights you have accumulated for yourself. The highest property right in an economy is money. It is the meta-property right that holds claim to all other property rights. So that is the deep connection I think here. And thats why people are crazy about money, by the way. If youve ever whos lost money, or money can also make people crazy, its getting to the deep circuitry of who we are! And to that end I do think that our modes of social organization, they can exhibit these predator and prey dynamics, where youll see  again its all about inputs and outputs at the end of the day. We think individually and individually we are compassionate, by the way, with our local group, and what people do well  we want to have reciprocal altruism in all of these things. However that compassion does not scale! Again, back to the Dunbar number thats kind of the limit of what organic societies can mobilize with apps and collective imagined order like we described earlier. You cant really scale biologically beyond that Dunbar number of 150 or so odd people. So if you look at nations or some larger groups, it would be a lot more cutthroat! So if theres a way that the collective can earn more outputs from  if theres a way for individuals operating a collective like state governors or military officials, they can input less energy than they can get in output. So they can enforce a monopoly on violence and impose taxation that costs them X, and then they get tax revenue that equals X + 1, they will do that, right? Its an economics game! Its not how you feel about the people, its very ruthless in that way. So in that way thats what I think you see happen throughout history with this disruption of monetary orders, economics game. And thats what drives the market by the way! To zero in on the money that is most resistant to theft, supply manipulation, because at the end of the day, people have learned through these countless market iterations that, I need to store my wealth  this accumulation of time and energy savings, the fruits of my labor  I need to store it in a form of money that cant be inflated, confiscated, deauthorized, and that money was gold! It was trust-minimized money is another way to say it. So thats what made gold, gold. But again the drawback was the custody and portability issue. Gold was an insufficient [inaudible 37:13] so we couldnt move it easily, we couldnt beam it over telecommunication channels, so it did not keep up. It forced us to need to trust custodians to warehouse that gold and maintain that currency peg 1:1, that trust is always abused until it falters. To get to why the US had established itself as the gold standard is again about gold. In World War II, every time Nazi Germany would invade a country, the first place they would go is straight to that countrys central bank and hoard their gold reserves. They did this in Poland, they did this with a few others. And very quickly many European countries wised up to this and said, We need to ship our gold out and store it somewhere that Nazis cant plunder, and it just so happened by geographic happenstance that North America became that safe haven! So as a result of World War II, a lot of gold  most of the worlds [gold]  ends up in North America, and then surprise, surprise, end of the war, US steps in, [passes] the remaining opponents that are all war-weary, theyve been fighting, theyre resources are diminished, and US is holding all the gold, so we sent out people in, we finished the job, we then hold a peace conference to rewrite the banking system rules to our own favor. So we say that the US dollar will be pegged to gold, all other national currencies will be pegged to the US dollar, so were on this gold standard, but its a gold standard that the US controls, because now the world is trusting the US to be the gold custodian effectively in this model. And that was 1944. 30 years later, the world sees that the US is producing way too many dollars than its gold reserves can justify, countries start demanding settlement in gold. They want to sell their dollars and repatriate gold. And eventually it gets to a point where the US says, Weve had enough of this! And they stop, they close the gold window in the infamous 1971 Nixon shock. I think it was Germany that tried to repatriate their gold when the US decided that they didnt have enough. And that moved the world into this totally uncharted territory of a global fiat standard. And if you just look at the socioeconomic data ever since, things have gotten really bad in a lot of ways.", "image": null}

Lets take that lens and turn it now back a little bit towards the aggry beads in Africa and what happened there. Before we get back to the power that the central banks have now, that weve broken the peg and were no longer pegged to gold.

It blew me away! And Im a guy thats been staring at this and just to see it happen I was completely floored! So I can only imagine what its like for others, its gotta be similar at least. We see another dynamic similar to the Yap Islanders in that aggry beads were small decorative glass beads that were used as money for centuries in Western Africa. This is around the 16th century that Europeans begin landing on African shores. Theyre doing expeditions both exploratory and trading expeditions. And shrewd Europeans discern that, Hey! These Africans are using these small glass beads as money! Theres glass-making facilities back in Europe that I can mass-produce these things. I can counterfeit these things en masse and I can bring these things into the market and acquire all of these goods and services that the African economy can offer, basically at a discount. So just like OKeefe collapsing the production cost of Rai stones with the Yap Islanders, Europeans are able to collapse the production cost of aggry beads in Western Africa and thereby use it as a mechanism for confiscating their wealth. To your point earlier, if wealth is just this accumulation of time saved or its frozen time, we could say both money and capital are both a form of frozen time or energy, and time and energy has to be invested to create them. And then capital and money  money could be used to claim time from other people, capital can be used to improve your productivity which is to say to increase your returns on time spent. You can dig a hole faster per man hour with a shovel than you can with bare hands, you can catch more fish per hour with a fishing rod than you can with your bare hands, etc. So what happened was a surreptitious confiscation of African wealth over time, that these expeditions kept coming in. Africans actually could discern a little bit that some of these beads were counterfeit and there was a little bit of resistance at times, but that just fed back into better counterfeiting, and before you know it it became all mixed up of capital from Africa into the hands of Europeans was just tremendous over time! But this was a little more painful because it was slow and surreptitious. Versus the Yap Islander situation that was small and quick so that it was able to sort itself out. This one was much more of a parasitic long term relationship where it wasnt evident to African traders what was happening! They were just getting impoverished slowly over time as a result of this relationship. And the net outcome of that was impoverished Africans. Slavery was already practiced in Africa, so eventually they started selling slaves to Europeans, they started selling one another, family members, everything. And this catalyzed the trans-Atlantic slave trade. So the point here is that its not just a metaphor to say that stealing money is stealing human time. Its not just a metaphor! It directly contributes in this instancethe stealing of human time through compromising the money supply directly contributed to the direct theft of human time in the form of slavery. And the trans-Atlantic slave trade was just an atrocious thing! It was 365 years, 12.5 million lives stolen directly from African shores shipped to Europe and the America, 2 million of those died in transit in the infamous Middle Passage. It still has effects in the United States and Europe today. Not only were those lives stolen directly, but their children were born into slavery, this led to the Civil Rights movement in the 60s, all of these cascading socioeconomic consequences were rooted in [inaudible 47:13]. So the big argument there is an exclusive privilege to produce money without accountability to market forces is an apparatus of enslavement, and thats exactly what central banking is. They are counterfeiting currency to the benefit of their own shareholders at the expense of everyone else. So my argument there is central banking is the black corps in the world today that leads us towards more totalitarian government, and ultimately well see situations like we saw in Soviet Russia at some point if it goes unchecked!

Id like to stack some numbers up side by side. You touched on it a little bit before, but its like, the Trans-Atlantic slave trade  and I hate to break down these calculations into time and economics, but I think its important to benchmark things  6.8 billion hours of human time per year was stolen over 365 years. Youre talking about 2.5 trillion hours of time stolen! Not even including the progeny, the people that died. And you think about Harold and Louis, and each one of those individuals could have been a Louis, and could have been part of building a dynasty or some sort of citadel for their family or foundation or prosperity. And that was taken away. And then you see even more egregious scenarios where you have these unfair fights where now you move from aggry beads to cloth strips. I think its Portugal, is fabricating and counterfeiting cloth strips which are money in parts of Africa, theyre buying slaves with the fabricated cloth strips  some of these slaves happened to be weavers of cloth strips! Now indentured slaves are brought to Portugal, where theyre now building an economy around taking indentured slaves and having them produce the counterfeit goods that are then enslaving their own people. And it just cycles through! Id be curious to hear how that benchmarks against 40 years of being off of the gold standard? And I think that these are really big connections! You said something earlier before where  and I slightly disagree with you in terms of like, People are listening or learning  Im not convinced that this is getting through to the masses  all of these examples! Thats why I really beat them! I want to highlight them! Because theyre not taught in school, theyre not even taught in higher education and universities  the history of money and how we chose gold, and what makes good money. Its interesting though because you can see signs that people understand this over time. You have music like in 1971 you have Marvin Gaye, Inner City Blues, talking about inflation, but it doesnt mean that its getting through or that this kind of ethos is really connecting with people! Even now Bitcoin is accelerating and more people are asking me about it in a positive light, but I dont think theyre connecting aggry beads and fiat! But if we could just benchmark a little bit of how you see the time theft through fiat money printing. And the lenses there is that, if you can make glass beads for essentially free, if you can make cloth for free, and if you could make money for free, what does that mean? And then just kind of benchmark it.", "image": null}

One way to think about it is the exchange value of money will converge to its production cost over time. So if it only costs you next to nothing to make a cloth strip or a glass bead, theres an incentive to spend that money buying goods and services until market exchange value reaches production cost  until youve inflated it down to its production cost. And that also explains the incentive scheme behind fiat currency. Its literally a keystroke in a centralized ledger. We say printing money often, but they dont even print money as much as they used to! Its more about a keystroke of entering new reserves into a bank balance is pyramided on top of to increase the money supply. So I quantify the Trans-Atlantic slave trade to benchmark the Fed against just the US central bank  not looking at the other central banks around the world. And you can develop a proxy for the amount of time stolen from the productive economy through quantitative easing, or money printing. And the data I used to do this were the average hourly wage rate per year  this is from the Social Security Administration in the US  I looked at the changes in US M2, which is the money supply year over year in the US. You can then divide that change  that increase in the money supply  divided by the average hourly wage rate. It gives you a proxy for how many hours were stolen. Thats basically: What is the market rate per hour of the average worker? How much money did the government print that year? Thats how many hours were stolen, because when a government prints money, theres no fair trade there. Theyre not adding any productive assets into the economy. Theyre not putting any assets in, theyre not adding any human time, no ingenuity  nothing. Its just a reallocation on the claims of the productive factors in an economy from the hands of one to another. From the hands of society to the hands of the government, or the central bank you could say more specifically. And when you stack this over  I only looked back 40 years, 19812020  the average hours stolen per year by just the US central bank, the Fed, came out to 23.4 billion hours per year stolen for 40 years straight! So this was two and a third as many as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, 6.5 billion hours per year. I guess its closer to four times, actually! Three to four times more hours stolen per year than the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. And over the course of 40 years, the total calculus came out to almost 1 trillion human hours stolen by the Fed in 40 years of money printing. And then if you quantify that back to the workforce number, its as if the Fed had a slave force of about 11.7 million people for 40 years straight, breaking down the hours to the number of people needed to satisfy those hours. For a long time I took a great deal of reticence to talk about central banking in this way, because it is distinctly different from physical bondage, where there are chains and whips and violence thats very visceral and real. Inflationary monetary policy driven by central banks is something much less visible than that, much harder to identify, but because of that invisibility, the tradeoff is that its done at a much larger scale! Its three to four times as much as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, looking at just one central bank! So its bad! What else can you call systemic time theft other than slavery? When you look at it through this lens I think it gives you a frame of reference on whats truly wrong in the world today! We have theft at a minimum, slavery at a maximum, integrated directly into the prevailing economic order. And it may sound crazy, it may sound tinfoil hat, but just a quick study of the history of humanity  weve always had systems of slavery, always!  every civilization has enslaved someone else. Its been the norm  the vast majority have used slaves. Weve just figured out a way to really scale it and hide it in a more sophisticated way than weve ever done before, in the institution of central banking.", "image": null}

Thats a really interesting way to put it! I think what makes that really hard to grok is that, one, what make it really hard to grok at first in 2019 was, Im a huge benefactor I believe of this sin or this scam or this heist! And Im not incentivized  I wasnt incentivized in 2019 in my mind to do anything about it! I was a big beneficiary of it. I dont philosophically. I dont mean from justice. I wasnt for it, but it wasnt really in my best interest to find this as a truth! And it was shocking! And in the two years since, I now feel like what used to be an exported heist is now turned inward. Because we can no longer take advantage of whats going on outside of our borders to the degree that we have, both through physical force and through fiat central banking human ranching or farming. Now I feel that its turned inward, and thats where I think it really started to click at a deeper level.

Theyre distracting people, people are still caught up in this hallucination that its red versus blue, conservative versus liberal, when in fact they all serve the central bank master! But I would argue that Im less concerned about  I mean clearly it would be great to wake people up immediately, but these things take time. So the way I see things playing out is: the more money is printed, the more abusive the system becomes, the more demand will be driven for encryption technologies, self-sovereign solutions, Bitcoin, frankly  people want to store their wealth in a place it cannot be confiscated, manipulated, abused, inflated. And the experience that Ive gone through falling into the Bitcoin rabbit hole: where your money goes your mind follows  as with the experience youve gone through  it changes people over time. So my longer term vision and bet is that over the next 10, 20, 30 years, youre gonna have a massive awakening that the state is just a giant scam! Its a huge fraudulent organization. It abuses people. And now people have this ability to fight back in an unprecedented way with digital technologies: they can self-organize, you can move your capital in a system parallel to a legacy financial system, you can escape capital controls, you can do all  so that gets into the whole Sovereign Individual thesis, which I always mention this book. Im writing an essay series on it now, its gonna be a 12-part series more or less covering one part per chapter in the book, plus one extra part covering Bitcoin specifically. Im arguing that were transcending this false statist dichotomy between capitalism and communism, and that Bitcoin enables a new mode of socioeconomic organization Im calling Sovereignism. And that encryption technology  which is at the heart of the Internet, Bitcoin, and other tools that I think well see coming down the pipe in the coming years, this is inherently disruptive to the state. It gives people a level of sovereignty thats never before been possible! We needed a large monopoly on violence to preserve the peace and protect property rights in a trading economy before, but now a lot of these functions that the state was necessary for in the analog stages can be satisfactorily provided by software in the digital age. So were in a Renaissance, really. The transition from the agricultural age into the industrial age or the fall of the feudal age  these things in retrospect theyre major transitions, but no one saw them coming! If youre living in feudal society, you just think this is just the world, and the way its just gonna be forever. The printing press is invented10 million books are printed in a year. [inaudible] These ages are getting shorter and shorter. Agricultural age is much longer than the industrial age, the industrial age is much longer than the information age that were moving into. Technology, as its innovation cycles accelerate, our organizational cycles accelerate, because society is a reflection of the technologies used to facilitate it! So weve moved from large scale industrial tech, which necessitated a large scale nation state, to small scale microprocessing and digital technology, which will enable small scale self-organization. Who knows where this goes! But I think its abundantly clear by this point that digital changes everything! Software is eating the world, and government is not immune to that!", "image": null}

One way to think about prices is as an element that determines where attention is warranted. So if the price if something is increasing, that represents an unsatisfied want in the market economy  there is more demand than there is supply for this good or service. And so by extension, Bitcoin is a clear example of this. When a price of something goes up, attention is drawn to is. People pay attention to price changes. And you could say that the element for drawing attention is that the demand is outstripping supply, so theres an unsatisfied want there. So this draws the attention of producers in the marketplace to go and try to solve that want. The opposite would also be true, that if the price is declining, its sort of descending away, its getting less attention. It would indicate that a want is being satisfied more efficiently and effectively, and producers or entrepreneurs would pay less than that. Again in terms of the connection between price and attention, Bitcoins a great example of that. Every time the price goes up or down, thats when it gets attention or less attention. So in that way, centralized bodies producing money, theyre inflating the nominal price of assets or goods or everything, right? Theres more dollars. The example that I gave is a wine maker operating in a central banking economy, who essentially faces three courses of action when a central bank prints money. The assumption is that hes selling his wine for $20 a bottle to begin with, so he knows that, Okay, say the central bank doubled the money supply, just assume inflation is even  its not actually even in the world but for simplicitys sake  assume that his inputs are gonna effectively double in price. He has three choices: He can continue selling his wine for $20 a bottle and eat the loss  his cost of inputs has doubled but he keeps his price the same  he eats the loss due to inflation, he can choose to double the price of his wine to $40 a bottle, which will keep his margin constant  so the cost of inputs has doubled, he doubles his selling price, his margin is constant  or, he could water down his wine, or use cheaper ingredients, a lower quality products but he keeps selling it at $20 a bottle to preserve some of that margin. So faced with those three options, clearly hes not gonna take the loss. If he increases his price to $40 a bottle which would be the honest thing to do frankly, he is creating more attention, right? Hes increased the price of wine, so hes drawing more attention from competitors that will look to sell that bottle at a higher price as well, and then those competitors might not be as honest as him! They may choose to sell the wine at a higher price or even a lower price and compromise on quality, so hes left with kind of this third choice, because even if hes honest hes probably gonna lose some business to competitors  because hes had to increase his price by doubleand then his competitors can hide some of that cost through again, cheaper lower quality ingredients. So hes sort of incentivized to deceive his customers in the short run! Now over time this would work itself out because his reputation  say he would have a reputation for a certain quality of wine  he would then be diminishing that quality which over time his reputation would be diminished as well. But it would take time for this to occur. So the moral of the story is: inflation is forcing producers to be more short term oriented. Again in raising their time preference. Which also encourages them to deceive their customers in the short run. Theyre thinking less about their long term reputation, more about their immediate financial profitability. And as a result of theft integrated in the money supply, inflation integrated directly into the money supply, producers of all sorts are forced to weigh their moral and financial [costs] in this way, theyre gonna have to hold each one in each hand and decide, Am I gonna put food on the table and a roof over my head for my family, or am I gonna compromise a little bit [to run a better] business? So its that mode by which I argue inflation is a cancer on the socioeconomic and moral fabric of reality. And again if civilization is [characterized] by the lowering of its time preference and the broadening of its time horizons, inflation is causing us to become less civilized, more deceptive, more short term oriented in general. And I think you can see this again back to https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/ inflation screws up society really bad!", "image": null}

And weve had some discussions about it but I think its really interesting that humanity is subject to these cycles that are  I mean I dont know where they come from, theyre just these super-seasons almost, these 70-year turnings. And I dont know where they come from but I find it very interesting! Dalios economic cycles are interesting too, but I would argue that a lot of them are driven by this vulnerability of money to be co-opted, to have its scarcity compromised, which incentivizes people to accumulate debt. If your money is losing money every year, then youre incentivized to take out debt in current dollars, and let the inflation diminish your real debt burden over time, so again it flips, it inverts the incentives of money, where typically the incentives of money are to create savings. Savings undergird investment, investment improves time preference. So were actually thinking longer term, were becoming more civilized. Fiat currency inverts that entire situation. And I think most of Dalios work is focused on that aspect of money, that its been repeatedly abused and pushed to be a more debt-based money over time, and then you get these huge inflationary booms, which is actually just a giant misallocation of capital. People are starting projects that they think they can profitably complete, but its all a result of a distorted price signal, and then once reality comes into play, it collapses! So this is the Austrian business cycle theory, that fiat currency distorts price signals and exacerbates the boom and bust business cycle. And I think Dalios work really just  without saying it  measures and focuses on that. Saying that fiat currency is disturbing the standard business cycle. Which the standard business cycle would just be, people are always gonna get hyped up, overexuberant about something and its gonna get a correction. Thats normal! Growth is inherently unstable. But fiat currency fuels that fire and exacerbates it tremendously!", "image": null}

Alchemy again back to moderns  we think that alchemy is a joke  its a bunch of people that thought they could turn lead into gold and it never worked? Not at all what it was! It was basically the precursor to the Scientific Revolution. Carl Jung says that alchemy was the dream from which science was born. You know Ive only got like five minutes left here so I cant dive into it completely, but Ill say that I find it very interesting that the highest aim of alchemy was to develop or discover the incorruptible substance. And this substance was to serve as the antidote to tyranny in general. But we would say that most forms of tyranny are state-based at least in the modern age. And I find it very interesting, this connection! The other thing is people think it was about how to turn lead into gold? That was just the symbol of it, actually. To turn lead into gold was to eliminate impurities, to absolutely eliminate impurities, to uncorrupt matter. And in removing corruption from matter there was also this feedback with the soul, the spirit, the character of man. So it would actually be refining our own morality, character, uncorrupting ourselves as we pursued this decorruption of the world, if you will. Again the highest aim was the Philosophers Stone, which the alchemists called the lapis philosophorum, it was the incorruptible substance they were seeking. And I find it very interesting the connection to Bitcoin that 21 million Bitcoin is the first incorruptible thing mankind has ever created! Weve created something that existed beyond our own reach. No one in the world, no entity, no individual, no government, no central bank, can change  thus far at least, 12 years into Bitcoins life , $600 billion in market capitalizationa civil war later, that was Bitcoin Cash it was a Bitcoin fork, there have been a number of attempts to co-opt Bitcoin, to increase supply, increase block size, etc. Its been hardened through hostility. Thus far it seems as though 21 million Bitcoin is the first incorruptible figure mankind has ever created. And by being incorruptible, the great promise of Bitcoin is to disrupt the greatest institution of tyranny in human history, which is the central bank! So we have an incorruptible substance in Bitcoin, we have an antidote for the corruption of central banking. And if you talk to Bitcoiners that have studied this thing deeply and are active with it intimately, it changes you! Bitcoin changes you! I dont know how to describe it specifically, everyone has their own flavor of experience of it, but the general theme is that youre more family focused, youre more community focused, youre more purpose driven, more focused on saving, less focused on spending, youre asking deeper questions, youre thinking about the world more. It really does have a tremendous impact on the character of those that go down this rabbit hole earnestly. I dont know. I dont know what it is: is Bitcoin the Philosophers Stone, the lapis philosophorum, who knows? I mean this sounds extra crazy tinfoil hat, but I would just say go do the research yourself! Look into it! Most of my knowledge of alchemy came from Jordan Petersons book Maps of Meaning, which is a tremendously difficult book but also a very worthwhile read. And were existing in a time where ancient wisdom seems to be resurging in the digital age. We get people doing yoga, meditation, ayurvedic medicine, paleo diets, psychedelics like ayahuasca are becoming more important, Bitcoin you can even argue is a form of ancient wisdom in that its Austrian economic money. Austrian economics is the ancient wisdom of economics! Whereas Keynesian economics is central bank propaganda, more or less. So maybe this alchemy thing coming back in the digital age too is part of that! I dont know, but I find it very fascinating!", "image": null}

Ive got a Youtube channel and a podcast, the What Is Money Show. Our first guest was Saylor and the Saylor Series. Were gonna do similar series like that with the best thinkers in the world, essentially. So my aim is just to sit down with some of the smartest people in the world and talk as long as they want about whatever relevant topic they want. Try to make it something like the intellectual Olympics, something like that, so that theyre very enjoyable to watch. Also on the Twitter page Ive got a LinkTree that I update frequently which has links to all my work. Thank God For Bitcoin, I co-authored that with seven other co-authors. Its been very well received! It goes into the moral applications. Its a moral treatise on Bitcoin told through a Christian lens. Its not a preachy book. Its not a super rah-rah Christian book, I think it just makes the moral case for Bitcoin and roots that in some Judeo-Christian mythology. And yeah I feel extremely fortunate to be working in this space! Its given me purpose. I Tweeted this earlier today: Before Bitcoin I wanted dollars. After Bitcoin I wanted to make a difference. If you let it, Bitcoin will make you more purpose-driven. So I would encourage others to let it! To explore this space deeply and earnestly, and it will make you ask fundamental questions that will transform you!", "image": null}

And I must say  for me especially  this is a fantastic place to be, because the model and the research that Ive done seems to be getting validated as we speak! Its a bit too early to call of course, were not at the levels we are expecting, but hey it sure goes up, and it goes up at exactly the time that the model predicts  that is right after the halving or slowly after the halving to our target level.

So we have your OG model, the S2F model, and weve also got the S2FX, the cross-asset model. In terms of performance against reality, how would you rate them the two different ones?", "image": null}

And maybe to give listeners some context, especially the new ones  a lot of new people are getting into this space  the first stock to flow model was created in March 2019 and it was a time-series model, so it looked at the Bitcoin price and it looked at the stock to flow and measured to quantify scarcity and then theres a nice correlation between them. And you can extrapolate that into the future and you get to a value that was then quite conversatively estimated at $55,000 end of 2021. And its later adusted with new data and other [coin?] correction to $100,000 USD at the end of 2021. So thats the first model  the original OG stock to flow model! Then a year later in April 2020 the S2FX model  the cross-asset model  was made, and it was basically not a time-series model anymore! So it was a model that also uses the same stock to flow measure for scarcity and looks at market values, but then, across different assets! So Bitcoin is one asset, and I divided four phases  four phase transitions within Bitcoin. But then it also includes in the model, in the data, and ultimately in the model parameters  the stock to flow and market value of other assets like gold, real estate, silver, diamonds  and thats what makes it very different from the stock to flow model originally, but also more robust if you ask me! The important thing is that price prediction for end of 2021 is also a bit higher  its $288,000 as an average price in that specific four-year period. To be honest, I like both models  theyre both my babies! But if I had to choose, I would choose the S2FX model, because its not a time-series model so its more robust. Its always better to have time out of the equation, because well get maybe into that later, but if you correlate to time-series, there is a big risk of correlation being spurious. And that risk is less if you dont have time series! The other big thing is that we can now interpolate instead of extrapolate! If you have a time-series model  it can be the number of transactions, it can be the time itself, it can be the number of Bitcoins in existence  then you dont know what the number of transactions in the future are, and to base the prediction on top of that is a risky thing! Its extrapolation  its based on data that you dont have in your data set! But the S2FX model, we have gold being at a higher stock to flow, and real estate being at a higher stock to flow and higher value, so we can actually interpolate within the data that is used to fit the model, and that is a very, very strong argument for this S2FX model!", "image": null}

The thing is, its kind of shifted over time, right? And I guess were talking about both the different models, but with the S2F, one of the interesting developments was this idea of cointegration, which then later it seems that part has now been shown that we can apply the cointegration test. From your perspective, what does that mean? Does it essentially just mean we dont have the confidence that would have been provided by cointegration, but you believe that the model might still provide some high-level predictive power? Is that how you would summarize it? Or how would you summarize it?", "image": null}

By the way, I got a lot of critique on the models, which I also invited, because I think the models are only getting better if theyre open sourced and discussed! And the point you mention about cointegration was one of the more interesting and very intelligent discussions! I liked that very much! Its important to know that it only applies to the first model  the time-series original S2F model  and not to the S2FX model. And what it basically does  its a measure that gives you some certainty that it is not a spurious regression, not a spurious correlation. Because theres always a risk that you find correlation [but] that there is no causation or no relationship at all! Its just a fake, fake correlation  thats always a risk! And to be clear, that is still a risk! It could be, the relation between stock to flow, scarcity, and value, could be spuriousalthough every day that seems less likely! It is important to make that point! Now with cointegration its actually a test, and that test  if you apply it and it proves cointegration  then the less likely, its not certain, but the less likely the relationship, the correlation, is spurious, is false. So theres a lot of probability that its a causal relation and a correlation that you can use for making predictions! But the discussion was quite interesting because it was actually held with a Dutch guy, an Australian guy, a German guy, and me! There were four people working on the same data and the same test. And first we all did the same test and the test clearly showed cointegration! And cointegration means that the series stick together very closely. The story about the drunk and the dog was made. The drunk goes on the street to walk his dog, the dog is on the lease, the drunk goes everywhere, the dog goes everywhere, but the distance between the drunk and the dog can never be longer than the leash! And thats what you measure  the leash! They always stick together, and actually thats what you see in the data! If you look at the Bitcoin price, it sticks to the model, it tracks the model really really close! And if you do the test, you also measure there is cointegration. But then the German guy said, Well, one of the assumptions of the test is that both variables are stochastic and not deterministic, so they should be random and not predetermined. And of course, stock to flow is predetermined! So we couldnt apply the test! So although the test showed cointegration, theoretically and practically we cannot use it! But it clearly shows the moving of the price around the model. The test also shows it, but we cannot use it! Yeah, that was the end of it right there! You could say, Okay, we should use another test, or develop another test, because it clearly sticks to the modelthe price. But on the other hand, its maybe best to be conservative and say that there is no cointegration and probably the relationship is spurious! So, that was the end of that discussion! On the other hand, if theres no cointegration, it doesnt mean there is no correlation. And the cointegration only works on the time-series model  so the original S2F model. By the time the discussion was at its peak, I introduced the other model, the S2FX model, and there of course you see an even higher R2, and even higher correlation, and we cannot apply the cointegration test over there. Yeah, that was a very interesting discussion at the time!", "image": null}

If you do it on other coins for example you find no correlation between stock to flow and price. You actually find cointegration and correlation with the price of those altcoins and the price of Bitcoin, but not between their own stock to flow and the price of those altcoins. If you look at gold and silver and other assets, there are not much assets with a large stock to flow! With a stock to flow larger than, say, 2. Theres really not much there: silver, gold, diamonds, real estate, maybe art. Art is a $2-$3 Trillion market but I dont have the data for that! I would be very happy to analyze if somebody has the data. But thats about it I guess. For example if you look at gold, gold over the same period that we have the Bitcoin data, since 2009  if we look at the stock to flow of gold and the market cap of gold, it sort of stays the same! Its very stable and I plotted it in some of the charts. The amount of movement in stock to flow of gold and the market price of gold is  if you plot it, its really stable! Its remarkable!", "image": null}

And I think youve also been Tweeting out recently just under a month ago, you were saying, RIP to the idea of lengthening cycles and diminishing returns. So why was that?", "image": null}

Its basically the time model that a lot of guys are using, and that is I think for the first time used and published by Trolololo in 2014. It has this nice curve and it fits the price of Bitcoin very well! But it tends to be not that stable. It tends to be you have to adjust it every year to keep it fitted to the data. So the time model is there but its also underestimating it a little bit, and it doesnt of course give credence to the step function that you see in the Bitcoin price. And that occurs after the halving! So if you use the time model, its the first crude indication and weve all seen those charts, but it doesnt give any weight to the halvings and the very clear timing of price rise that you can see in the Bitcoin price that is around a year, one-and-a-half years after the halvings. Its a nice model, but its maybe a starting point but not a robust one. And while were at it, I think it also underestimates it a little bit, because if you look at the S2FX model, you can clearly see that last period, the last couple of years, the Bitcoin price was a little bit underperforming to that model. So the phase if you will  the last four years  was lower than the model predicted! And that might be due to COVID, the last part of that four-year period was kind of low, but if you use only that data  the time series data  to fit the curves, then it must be a little bit lower, it must track that lower data in the last couple of months! The other thing, actually the main reason why I said the lengthening cycles and the lower cycle theory is dead  if you track the prices without the model, just looking at the data, you compare it to what happened after the 2016 halving and what happened after the 2012 halving, you see that the price now is right in the middle of those two historic tracks. And the diminishing cycle return theory says that it has to be lower. It states that the next peak will be later and lower than the last  well if you look at it right now its obviously not the case! Its a bit early to call I should say, but were smack in the middle of the last two! So yeah, it doesnt look that way!", "image": null}

Even though we dont have cointegration and thats not part of it anymore  its just interesting to a person looking at that chart, that you think, Okay, its really interesting that its staying inside that range!

But first of all, the fact that the price tracks the model so well its actually magical to see! Also for me! You make the model, you hope it will be right, but of course the proof is in the pudding, and now we see it happening. So its really magical to see it, Im very happy about that. And we have to see whether it goes to the $100k or the $288k, but Im quite optimistic about the $288k. That would be my target! About the 463 days, thats actually an improvement that was suggested by Preston [Pysh]. Preston and I discuss the models a lot, and also that site digitalik.net, and you mentioned the Bitstein bot  it is a beautiful thing! And digitalik has also real-time charts on his website. Well Preston said  youd have to ask him himself because he can tell it much better than I!  but he said, Okay I see what you did there. You tried to keep the model as simple as possible, only to have the stock to flow as an input, but we also see from the last two halvings that the price effect kicked in later. So there was a time lag in price going up after the halving, and we can model that if just very roughly look at the last two halvings. We see that the all-time high after the 2012 halving was about 13 months after the halving, and for the 2016 halving that was about 17 months after the halving! So on average theres 15 months from the halving to the all-time high, and if you multiply that by the number of days in a month which is 30.5, you get very close to that 463 number, and thats how you calculate it! And when you use that number the fit will be even better than if you use only the stock to flow variable, because you now have adjusted the average to stock to flow over those 463 days. Yeah I think thats a very nice addition and it tracks even better!", "image": null}

I wonder, because we really dont know when any of these things break down, right? And when I say break down, I mean break to the upside! It may just be that enough people around the world wake up to Bitcoin, start buying it, and then just completely destroy all the models and just completely blast through, right? And this would be more like  as I was discussing with Preston  the idea of the final cycle. So I wonder, as you look at the landscape, whats your thoughts on that idea of, Okay, are people just gonna start front-running the future cycles and just buy it all now?

Well thats a very interesting discussion! I think well be having that exact discussion for the next 1218 months at least! It touches on a lot of interesting aspects  this final cycle discussion. And let me mention a few: one is the efficient market hpothesis, which was also one of the critiques on my model. Nic Carter wrote a nice piece about it. The efficient market hypothesis says that all the information thats publically available should be reflected in the prices of the assets. Stock to flow is publically available, the model is publically available, it should not be so easy to make money as just to buy Bitcoin now, follow the model and be rich! That model cannot be! On the other hand, and then we come to this front-run argument: if now we see that the model does work, regardless of the efficient market hypothesis, it does work and it goes to $288k, what happens then? Will people when front-run the next cycle? Because for the next cycle the model predicts a price thats far above $1 million per Bitcoin! So will investors then price that cycle in as well? And the efficient market hypothesis says that they will, because the information is out there, weve seen that it works, and if everybody thinks that it works then it would be the rational thing to do! On the other hand, I dont know! I had that same question when the price shot up after publishing the article in 2019, but that turned out to be too early, because the price went down aftwards. But we had that exact same discussion back then! And just like back then, I think we will not have a final cycle now, and we will not see front-running  we will see some front-running, and some FOMO if you will after $288k  so the price will probably go much higher, maybe to a half-million at the all-time high, but I think the other important aspect is risk, and that was my counter-argument at the time against the efficient market hypothesis, that critique as well. And I wrote an article about that. Yes, the model is out there, yes all the information is out there and it shouldnt be as easy as it seems to be now to make money  just buy Bitcoin and follow the model and be rich  on the other hand theres perceived risks and real risks in the market. I did a poll on that! And the number one risk that people see is governments banning Bitcoin! And we see a lot of actions in that direction! We see US Treasury minister announcing draconian laws over Christmas with a process thats not very democratic, so theyre really trying to kill it! And we see today, like [inaudible from inaudible 27:56] warning about regulation that has to be made against Bitcoin, although regulation of course is not a ban, well it could be good or bad, but its a big risk! And people see it as a big risk, and governments have barely woken up to the possibility that Bitcoin could be a $1 Trillion, let alone a $10 Trillion market, so when that happens, they will move! And that could be a good thing or a bad thing, but there is a risk! And another risk is quantum computing. They could break the private public key relationship. So all the experts say its not possible and its not possible for at least ten years and there may be adjustments to the software, etc., but still it is a risk. And I think those risks whether true or not will surface again, especially after the FOMO phase, after we hit the stock to flow target models and maybe beyond. There will be risks, and there will be black swan events that make those risks look very real! We will go down again. So I surely think that that will happen, and also thats another argument  human nature! Greed and fear! It will stay the same. So yeah we probably will have FOMO once we go up and go beyond $100,000, and we go too high because of greed! And then some risk will surface and people will be so fearful and theyll estimate the risks too high and price will go down. I think that will stay the same. Having said that, the third discussion well touch  its the topic of hyperbitcoinization! All Bitcoiners know what it is, but it basically means that Bitcoin goes to the moon. That it will become a unit of account, and that maybe the Dollar dies. And Bitcoin will be the thing that we all use to pay and to save money. Yeah, when that happens, that would be the final cycle, but it would be more of a final cycle for the dollar in my opinion than for Bitcoin! So it will be the moment that the Dollar will end, to exist as the global currency. And I dont think that will be this phase, the phase 5 if you will, but the phase after phase 5, when Bitcoin will reach a market cap of somewhere in the neighborhood of real estate  lets say $100 Trillion USD. I like that number for some reason!", "image": null}

But as weve seen, most of the weak hands have already been shaken out by the volatility, so the hands holding the Bitcoin right now are stronger as ever! I mean if I look at my own coins, Im not gonna sell, never! Ever! But to the next person who wants to sell, but you dont get my coins. And they will be harder to get. And its really funny, I can see that on the on-chain data as well. The fact that theres not much coins. And I dont mean the balances on the exchanges that are Tweeted about and looked at. I mean really the on-chain data, it shows a pattern that is very consistent with the stock to flow model and the four-year cycle, and it shows a shortage that is scary actually!

You make that point and its a good point about how you add across Greyscale and Cashapp and Paypal and others  thats buying more coins each day than are issued by the miners each day. But then I guess the other part of it is old HODLers, because eventually at some price they might say, Okay I want to take some out and buy a house and buy a car, because obviously yes Bitcoin is going up but I need to live, I need to look after my family, I have living costs. Maybe that will become a more dominating factor of just how many people are willing to offload, even if its a small portion aggregated across millions of millions of HODLers. That small portion can add up to a new amount of supply hitting the market in terms of the sale of Bitcoin.", "image": null}

If the listeners dont know what we were talking about, Google it, look it up in Twitter and find that chart! The HODL waves basis is really an intriguing way of looking at Bitcoin! I make the HODL charts myself. If you run a full node you have all the data, so if you can do a little bit of programming in Python you can make them yourselves, and you can go a lot deeper than that as well. For example the UTXO set, the total amount of coins in the transactions that are unspent out that  that changes over time, which is sort of the HODL waves in one dimension. That gives a treasure of information about how those coins move, who is selling, and its really unique to Bitcoin as well, because in bank data you dont have that! You would have to have access to all the banks databases. With Bitcoin for the first time you have that!

One interesting one is looking at, of all the unspent transaction outputs, you can look at how many of them are sitting in a profit and how many of them are sitting in a loss position, and try to ascertain where the market is at from looking at those numbers. Looking more broadly at the macro world of all of this, what are some other relevant factors to think about?

Its a lot of FUD. Its really a lot of FUD, and its been there since Ive been in Bitcoin! For years and years Ive heard that type of FUD, and its at specific times, when the price is sort of wobbly and theres a lot of things going on such as with regulation at the moment, and all of a sudden  I get daily about 50 DMs in my Twitter of people, How about Tether? How about Tether? They put their comments under each one of my Tweets, and my impression is that its like an army of FUDsters that try to spin a story, and of course it gets picked up by people without a brain! So yeah its nothing! There was a podcast I dont know where it was but it was with the two guys from Tether last week  it was very good! They explained how it works and why Tether is there, because you know the banking system is very slow. If I transfer money to the US or to Australia it could easily take three days, where if I want to park some Bitcoin money in cash and use dollars for a couple of hours, that then would not be possible. So yeah you need a coin, a synthetic dollar where you can park your money that goes way faster than the old, slow, traditional banking system. And I get it! Of course how much the Tethers are backed by real dollars and other assets  thats an important thing and more transparency can be given there by Tether, but its a very traditional issue as well with having collateral against loans and future markets that are fully collateralized every day. I guess for people who are not aware or not familiar with those collateral processes, that it sounds very opaque and mystique, and its just stuff that you make a lot of FUD and conspiracies about, but for me its a non-issue.", "image": null}

But I mean, what Ive been seeing since 20082009 basically since Bitcoin was developed  since the global financial crisis  the amount of quantitative easing and the amount of money being printed by central banks what they have done the last years is so overwhelming, its the only macroeconomic topic! It overarches everything! Its staggering really how much money has been printed and what it has been used for! And Ive been in a position where I have dealt with banks on a daily basis, from bank contacts, with Basel capital management requirements, from insurance contacts, solvency requirements  weve been selling stuff to the central banks for years and years and years, and they buy everything! You know that famous scene in The Big Short where the crew is at a conference in Las Vegas about mortgages and mortgage securities  theres also conferences like that in Europe, actually the same organizers. And at those conferences  the central banks are there as well  everybody talks about the central banks because theyre the biggest buyer out there! They buy everything! They have an unlimited budget! I think if youre in the trenches and you deal with the central banks and with quantitative easing no matter how you call it  it can and has become a semantics game lately if youre in the trenches and doing this work, you see the absolute staggering obscenity of it, if you will! It really reminds me of Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany! Well have to see, but knowing the quantitative easing and how it works, its very helpful in making me a big believer in Bitcoin, I truly believe that!", "image": null}

That was the 2017 cycle and the 2013 cycle, and they are quite different actually! 2013 was of course very early, and it was in a stage where mining was a big topic as well, because that was the year also that ASIC chips  mining chips  application specific integrated circuits, very specific mining chips were produced and made the security of the network like a million times bigger, and everybody that had that chip had an advantage. So there was huge optimism and excitement about this next step in the Bitcoin history, and price shot up from a low of $2.5, average $5 to $100 to $1,000 within one year! So that was really unimaginably fast, without much corrections in between as well! But then 2017 the mining technology was already done, there was a lot of improvement but not that big huge jump like in 2013. So the new thing and the excitement was all about altcoins and ICOs and forks. Everyone was dreaming about tokenized world and new coins and FinTech wave hit the markets! And that craze shot the price up from $200-$400 at the low to $20,000 at the high, so that was also very nice rise, but it had several corrections in between, like six or seven! Very different from 2013. It had six or seven corrections of about 30% in between in that big rise. So right now the big question is: correction or no correction? I guess part of the answer we already have because we just had a big correction when price shot up from $10,000 to $40,000 and then crashed to $30,000, which is -25% correction. But if you ask me its very similar and maybe more similar to 2013 price-wise than 2017! So we might as well see not that much corrections on our way up! And that is also compatible with the macro environment that we see at the moment. We talked about that  the quantitative easing has gone full throttle of course since COVID, and more money has and will be made by central banks in the months to come than we have ever seen before. That money has to go somewhere! That goes to banks, that goes to companies that are saved that would have otherwise defaulted, and all the people, all the managers and employees of those companies, they can go on buying stuff which is a good thing of course, but it also keeps the economy going and in that way in a real sense that quantitative easing money  the printed money  enters the real economy! And it enters the real economy at the top first: managers, politicians, the people that are already rich. So what did they do with it? They buy assets: a second or third house, a street of houses, as an investment objective. They buy gold, they buy Bitcoin! And part of that you can quantify in the model, but part of that money will trickle down to assets and also to Bitcoin. But with the amount of money being printed, its almost unimaginable that we go down from here or have very big corrections. And quite honestly you can see that in the prices too! The last three months, if there was a significant dip in the price, it got scooped up immediately by buyers! And Michael Saylor was very eloquent and very open in how he did it, how he bought his first $200 million and the other $400 million and the other buys since then. He does this very professionally with a lot of help from people that have the equipment and the access to the market, and they move that money without moving the price too much, in very small tranches. [49:00] Yeah I have the feeling that every dip, every time the price goes down, there is somebody with stronger hands that will say, Thank you very much for the coins, they will now end up in my wallet and they will go in deep cold storage, never to be seen again! Or at least in the next ten years! So yeah I think were witnessing that right now! And it feels more like 2013 than 2017.", "image": null}

Ive been invited almost weekly to join meetings with hedge funds, family offices, banks, insurance companies, to talk about Bitcoin, not only the stock to flow model, but just the whole Bitcoin thing and how you can buy it and how you can hedge it and how you have to look at it as an investor. So theres really a lot of demand from investors, and one of the things that I find very interestingalso for myself  is the derivatives markets. So if you look at the futures market for example, you can now buy Bitcoin for, say, $35,000, and you can sell it at the same time for a year later  you can future sell it for more, I dont know what the price is, but $36,000. So you get a certain $1,000 profit, you only have to wait for a year! And of course you give up your upside and you also have no downside so theres really less risk, but you really have to know what youre doing. But anyway, if you do it like thatits a cash and carry strategy  you can make a 20% return annualized, and that is the kind of returns that Warren Buffett and famous hedge funds get! But not banks or insurance companies  theyd be happy with maybe 5%. So 20% in an easy trade like that is something that cannot be ignored and is seen by more and more people, and some people pop their toes in the water and of course it works. It is too good to be true! And after that in a negative interest rate environment that Im living in in Europe, -0.6%, you can actually borrow money for negative interest rates if youre an institutional investor. But even as a private individual you can lend against your house for 1% or lend without collateral for 3%! Well if you use that money  and Im advising not to do that, but for professional investors this is candy that is too good to be true! And then if we look at option markets, we see implied volatilities of over 100%, which means theres call premiums from 4050%. So you can do volatility harvesting strategies which are very very profitable and cannot be done on other asset markets! So the whole derivatives markets and the relation between the spot markets, derivatives markets, futures, options, etc., Ill be watching them like a hawkactually participating in them! I see a lot of people entering those trades and looking at it. I think the future and option market prices will give us a lot of information about the future, so its really interesting if the base rates of the futures stay that high, if the implied volatilities in the options markets stay that high, and yeah so thats one thing that cannot be denied anymore by the more traditional investors and that will be seen by more and more. The other thing  its not so much investing but more society thing  its a very positive thing: good money, sound money is very important for humanity! Its good for trade, its good for specialization, its good for capital allocation and allocation of scarce resources, where the investors were not. And to have sound money, a measure, a unit of account that can be counted upon, it can be depended upon, is very interesting! And very important! And we dont have that at the moment, because central banks are printing the money at will, theyre using it for political purposes, theyre weaponizing it, and its like an architect that uses a measure like the meter or an inch that changes every day! Imagine how a building like that looks after the architects are finished! And thats our economy at the moment! So were building with a measure that is changed every day, and Bitcoin will  for the first time  introduce a constant. And that is the 21 million coins. So that will for the first time ever, be a constant in finance like there is a constant in physics  the speed of light, for example. In mathematics. So that is from an Austrian perspective and I talked about this with Saifedean lately. It could be very interesting, this constant! And maybe with that comes a sort of predictability, but at least a totally different kind of economy, separation of money and state, and in my opinion it will even unleash the next Renaissance with science at the very heart of it, but also with art and freedom and a totally different society than we have at the moment that is dominated by governments and states. And this one will be more sovereign individual and math and art-based! So yeah I find that a very hopeful perspective, and thats maybe, apart from the investing, the main reason why I find Bitcoin so very very interesting!", "image": null}

And some of the earlier points you were just making there like the cash and carry strategy  now obviously for those of us who are more hardcore Bitcoiner, we wouldnt want to give up the upside of holding Bitcoin, but for somebody whos a little bit more trying to dip their toe in here, this is an easy way for that kind of person to  so long as they have the right institutional set-up to be able to achieve that kind of strategy. And I think the other point that you raised thats really interesting in terms of where the next big amount of demand or the next potential big markets of people who are gonna come into Bitcoin, is this whole cost of carry which were seeing in Europe! People who have large amounts of fiat money in their bank accounts are now starting to get charged for that! And well, if we think from a cost of carry perspective, you can quite cheaply hold Bitcoin for a tiny tiny fraction of the cost that these people are paying to hold fiat money in a bank account, so I think that is just gonna really start driving home this cost of holding fiat. Whereas historically it was free  or you made money on it!", "image": null}

Im kind of curious, just jumping back to your time at Oracle and selling enterprise software: what was that like, and what did you learn selling enterprise software that you kind of bring to the Bitcoin space? Or your outlook on economics, or how systems and networks work?", "image": null}

So I graduated college in 2010, and that was my first job out of school, was selling enterprise software. And I stayed there for about 4 years before leaving and doing other things, but my time there  a couple quick points: I would say the first thing that really threw me off was that Oracle is an IT company, right? They serve enterprise customers and they give them technology. And yet the internal technology at Oracle was garbage! So some of the sales reps were using Salesforce CRM tools to manage their own pipeline, even though Oracle had all kinds of CRM tools. And then you start calling on these large businesseslike one of my accounts was Verizon for a long time. And you take a look at a company that you think has their stuff together, and yet they make horrible decisions managing their IT year-over-year: everythings abandoned, its short term, and I was sort of disenchanted by the allure of these big companies and what they were meant to do. And if I go back a second, I felt at the time that my whole life was leading up to that, and going through business school and learning these things. And all of a sudden  you know, getting the job that I thought I wanted! And it just wasnt as fulfilling as I thought! I had a good time there, I paid off my student loans there, I met great people. The stress of a sales environment  I actually performed really well under that environment. I did well there! I just had the flash in my eye of, Is this the rest of my life? Is this what Im gonna be doing? That just wasnt good enough and so I took a little detour.", "image": null}

You speak about the internal architecture at Oracle. And then maybe [with] your own internal software it seems like you rearchitected your life! You kind of rebuilt it from scratch.

What ended up happening was, I was being groomed for a promotion. I flew out to Denver to meet with a new team. And I sort of had this experience of, I dont want to become these people! It was just the classic sales reps: not polite to the server, infidelity runs rampant in the community, and just all around deeply unhappy people! And soI feel that Im susceptible to my environment as most people are, and I could just flash before my eye again realizing that I was going to become this. And so what ended up happening is I just hit pause, I went through a Yoga teacher training here in Minneapolis while staying full-time at Oracle. And I sort of had the viewpoint of: (1) my future life at Oracle as the trajectory shows, and then you have (2) this other community of people that are radically different! That process opened my eyes to, Okay, maybe I dont have to do the thing I thought I was meant to do! And it gave me the courage to try something different. And so what youre alluding to then is my wife and I quit our jobs  we met at Oracle selling software  and we quit our jobs and bought a one-way ticket to India a few months later. Then we backpacked through Asia for a year, that was in 2014. All the while there we were building a wellness business essentially teaching wellness entrepreneurs like Yoga instructors. Teaching them business skills: how to build a website, how to market themselves, things like that. Because were business people that fell into the Yoga world, and we noticed that that community is not very good at business. We had the skills, so it was a nice match. We did that for 3 years traveling and working, and then bumped into Bitcoin in 2017. And then I realized, Okay, this is what I really want to be doing! And more or less, I put my foot on the break for the Yoga business stuff  hired a small team to run it  and then just decided, This things important here! Im gonna rearchitect everything on Bitcoin! If you think about it from the high level, the pendulum swung into the corporate world where I thought I was going, and then I just rebelled against it and did the complete opposite  backpacking hippie for a few years. And you know we meet sort of in the middle and theres Bitcoin! Which I think is a more wholesome synthesis of who I am! I think Im more suited for that! So yeah its been a fun ride in Bitcoinland ever since!", "image": null}

I did grow up eating mushrooms just casually, just put it on your steak. And it wasnt until I graduated college  I had started experimenting with psychedelic mushrooms, I started foraging and just looking for Morel mushrooms, which are common in the United States. And it was through foraging that really kicked it off! Youre just out in the woods, youre hiking around looking for treasure. That sort of kick-started an interest here. I started learning about what these things are, found out about Paul Stamets and started learning about them. That was maybe 2011 or so, that started. Yeah I carried that with me just as a side project! [06:40] Im always studying some weird thing. And it wasnt until we were living in Bali in 2018 the first half of the year and going to lots of meetups and writing for a crypto publication online which  anyways, forget that part of the story!  and then I started putting together the Mycelium Archetype. I first heard about it through Terence McKenna, who had explored the Internet through comparing it to Mycelium as sort of this living, breathing network-like organism where individual units sort of together create this larger whole. The sum is greater than the parts! And the whole network actually displays tendencies that a living organism might do! And so I had an epiphany that night in Bali, rode my scooter home, and just sat there and wrote and wrote and wrote, and more or less got probably 80% of the first article down  at least in idea form. And 6 months later I put it into an essay and published it. So it sort of merged the two worlds! Its quite shocking that in Bitcoin you can do something like that! As someone whos into a lot of weird stuff, the synthesis of the two and how its accepted in this community is pretty special! Whatever you bring to the table, that lens sort of taints your perspective on Bitcoin! But its also really useful, because you have these sort of analogies to draw on previous knowledge bases that people have, and so theres little short cuts into the Bitcoin ecosystem. At least thats how I see it!", "image": null}

I thought there were a lot of interesting things going on here! One I kind of saw you leaving Oracle and that kind of life and going out and building  its kind of like your Mycelium, you going underground, you getting distributed, you gaining knowledge, trading, growing, and then you kind of come up with Bitcoin, it seems like. Maybe thats your spore, I think thats the word! And what I find thats really interesting is that you look at Bitcoin through this mushroom lens! And what I think is really interesting about that is also the timing of it. Were in the bear market and the article gets into that! You know, Bitcoin is like Mycelium, its kind of growing organically and trading and learning, even though you dont see anything above the ground. And then you make this interesting connection where Mycelium and maybe Bitcoin are like dark matter and neurons in the Internet. They have life! Maybe you can touch on that: how is Mycelium like those things?", "image": null}

So Mycelium is  for people who arent necessarily initiated into the world of fungi  fungi have their own kingdom. You have animals, you have plants, you have fungi, etc. Theres millions of different organisms that make up this kingdom, and the predominant form these organisms take is the Mycelial form. And you can think of this like an underground root system. Its one cell-wall thick, its just an underground Internet  it connects all the trees and plants together, it forms communication networks, it communicates, it trades resources, it sort of acts as an immune system for the forest, and from that lens you realize that a forest is not this competitive thing. Like, yes theres competition here and there, but really it should be looked at as its own ecosystem that acts as one unit! And the Mycelium is sort of the membrane that holds it all together! And that underground network archetype just seems to show up all over the universe. So fungi have been doing this for over a billion years on our planet. Theyre sort of the shepherds of life on our planet. This network system just seems to be a really effective evolutionary strategy. And then you start to realize, all dark matter and dark energy takes on this same network archetype. So if you zoom way out, its the network. If you zoom in on your neurons, our brains our the same network archetype! And so you start to see it all around! And to me what that says is: its an evolutionary strategy that whatever we call life employs, and it happens to be a very effective strategy, because fungi are the most resilient type of species on our planet  its not even close! Theyve survived all six mass-extinction events. Where you know, the dinosaurs get wiped out  fungi inherit the earth. It happens again  fungi inherit the earth. So this network archetype just seems to be sort of the definition of antifragility! And now you look at that through a Bitcoin lens and you realize, Okay, Bitcoin is like this Mycelial network  individual people and computer nodes. We all sort of make this network, and we all act in our own rational best self-interest just like the Mycelium does. But together you form this unit that adapts to its environment! It seeks out unmet demands and sends a signal to developers to go create some new software. If a bug is in the system, information travels through the network and it rebuilds. So it learns and it adapts, and its very hard to kill because just like Mycelium you can break it in half  just literally break the organism in half  and now you have two organisms! And so you could cleave off a section of Bitcoin and you could go confiscate all of the miners in the United States, and the network routes around that and it creates an opportunity for another part of the organism to flourish! And you can sort of go down  and I like analogies, I find them to be effective. Obviously, Bitcoin is not Mycelium. But theyre useful, and some people push back, like, Speak true or speak straight! But I prefer the analogies. I think theyre more fun! And now thousands of people have reached out to me in DM saying, Hey! I didnt really understand Bitcointhis analogy worked! Or, I gave it to a friend, or, I didnt really think about Bitcoin in this way. And so it seems to have struck a chord. And to be fair, Im not the first one to talk about this. Ralph Merkle has a really famous quote where he says Bitcoin is a living organism. And if you havent seen this quote  I dont have it pulled up  but its a very, very cool, poetic way to look at Bitcoin! So Im standing on the shoulders of giants and since then many other people have written about it. Especially Gigis work, Proof of Life, etc. Thats a fantastic series!", "image": null}

I really dig this whole, Bitcoin is a living organism thing. I think it is an emergent life form of some kind! Does Mycelium make mistakes when its trading and learning? Does it have maybe an enzyme that is a casualty? The analogy Im kind of looking for  what Ive thought a lot about  is maybe the cyber hornets. Maybe they arent making mistakes! But like Ross Ulbricht and Roger Ver  who you know were in the Bitcoin space and were acting maybe  they thought in their rational interest and maybe perpetuating or trying to grow the system? I dont know where their place would be in the analogy.", "image": null}

Its like this branching, forking little finger-like tentacles that are each individually exploring their locality. And lets say one of those forking little branches of Myceliumthe edge of the network  lets say it comes across a predator of some sort. Another fungus or a bacteria. It sends information through the network to the specialist. The specialist mushroom scientist creates a custom enzyme  theyre the best chemists on our planet  creates a custom enzyme, and then ships it around the network. And then the network learns and grows. It has essentially a chemical library of different new molecules that it invented for its own benefit to survive, and then you apply that to humans  all of a sudden, we start taking compounds from the fungal kingdom! The majority of our medicine comes from fungi because our biology is so similar. And the medicine works for them and it just so happens to work for us. So back to the Roger Vers of the world  how I see them would be: theyre just one tip of the network. And they made a decision they thought was right. Now it seems like the network decided that they were wrong  but thats the deal! Theres casualties here! Underground is the most hyper-competitive part of all of our ecological systems! Its gruesome down there! And same with Bitcoin  its pure competition. You screw up  youre kicked off the network. No problem! And your reputation matters, and dont gamble with it!", "image": null}

Fungi eating rocks is the main reason we have top soil. Top soil enables us to grow food. It took fungi over 1 billion years to produce just 18 inches of top soil that we have today. I didnt even know anything about this! That part in the ecosystem, and the time it takes  any of this! I thought that was really interesting. What is horizontal gene transfer? And how is that different from other species or the way other networks work?", "image": null}

So lets compare it to vertical gene transfer. In genetics this is Mother + Father copulate and have an offspring, that offspring has the genes from the mother and father so its a vertical transfer from one generation to the next. And horizontal gene transfer is essentially  lets say theres two fungi in one ecosystem that are competing. And one fungi says, Wow, that other guy  hes doing really well! I wonder why hes so effective in this ecosystem? So the fungi eats the other one, or consumes some amount of genetic information. It absorbs from another species thats parallel to it, and then it incorporates that DNA into the species! Im anthropomorphizing here  I dont know what the fungi are thinking when they do this. But it seems like a last ditch effort that says, Wow, my strategys not working! Im gonna steal their strategy and hope it works! And now if you compare that to Bitcoin, the analogy I use is that, Okay, theres thousands of different cryptocurrencies now  they each make different tradeoffs, theyre all trying to create features to out-compete Bitcoin  I think the answer is its futile but theyre gonna try! And lets say theres some new technology thats produced  lets say zero knowledge proofs or some sort of privacy tech. Maybe Bitcoin wants to implement that! And so the Bitcoin Mycelial organism could perform horizontal gene transfer and just adopt what that other network uses and bolt that onto Bitcoin!", "image": null}

You make these broad and excellent points relating human psychology, hype cycles, and the mushroom method.

Maybe you could speak to that: how is that similar to Bitcoin cycles and our psychology and how we think about cycles?", "image": null}

I think thats a super fun analogy! So how Mycelial organisms lived is through underground  theyre in that networked form. And when conditions are absolutely perfect, it concentrates its energy right below the surface of the ground, and then it produces a mushroom that shoots out of the ground. That mushroom is like the apple on an apple tree. The real organism is underground, just like the tree is the Mycelial form. However that fruiting bodythat mushroomthat it is is a reproductive organ. It grows very quickly, and then it releases the little mushroom spores  tiny microscopic seeds that float around and they land nearby. And when they land nearby  as long as theres two of them near each otherthey fuse together and form a new colony. And then they live underground and they grow and grow and grow and then when conditions are right, that new organism reproduces by producing a mushroom! So thats the fungal life cycle. Now if we compare that to hype cycles in Bitcoin, most of Bitcoins life, the price is boring! Theres no hype  nobodys talking about it. Thats the bear market! Thats like the Mycelial form when its just underground, networking, eating, growing  all those things. But when conditions are absolutely perfect in Bitcoin land, the price goes crazy, everybody starts talking about it, capital floods in, your taxi drivers talking about it, and just like the mushroom, out of nowhere it explodes! It very quickly matures and dies back very quickly. So thats the blow-off top. But just before it starts coming down, it recruits all these new people to the system, and those are like the little mushroom spores. And now the mushroom spores fly all around. Most of them died, but a few of those newcomers into the Bitcoin market stay! And those become the next waves HODLers. And then the bear market  they network underground, they build resilience, thats when were doing things like Proof of Keys, getting people to hold their own custody, learning about Bitcoin. Yeah thats sort of the bear market! It feels like the Mycelial organism is concentrating all that matter right below the surface, and it doesnt feel very long before a mushroom will pop out and the price will rise!", "image": null}

The mushroom thing is so interesting because you talk about it in the book where humanity has had this long mysterious relationship with mushrooms: fear, maybe anxiety, euphoria, medicine. Its funny, its even in video games! The red and white mushrooms in Super Mario Brothers  I never really connected these dots. You even tell us what kind of mushroom that is! And then its like, Bitcoin conjures up a quasi-religious fervor. And we talked about it as a life form as well, and I feel both these kind of camps! How do these either inter-relate, or what does it mean that Bitcoin is like a religious fervor?", "image": null}

The first part is about Mycelium decentralization  essentially establishing that as a fungus. The second one is about the social layer. Thats humans interacting with Bitcoin. And you can think of that as humans interacting with mushrooms! And I take a long time-scale to go through that one, and what Im trying to bring up is that humans have had relationships with mushrooms for as long as we can look back in time. Oftentimes thats simple food. They can be used to sharpen your knives, as medicine, to transfer embers, to get you high, they can kill you, dyes  all kinds of things! Theres lots of fossil evidence of ancient man using these tools. Theres one famous one: tzi died in the Swiss Alps like 8,000 years ago. And what he had on him was a necklace with one mushroom which hardens when it dries out. Its so hard it can sharpen steel! And he had another mushroom that you can store an ember and travel long distance. You can have one ember for three to five days inside this. Its called a tinder conch. Think of a little vessel that keeps a spark alive. And if you think about ancient man, fire is everything! He was crossing the Alps in winter, and of course you need your fire! So what this tells us is that ancient man realized how important these mushrooms were, and they formed a relationship with them, and the humans that formed a relationship with mushrooms out-competed the others! [22:37] Then you fast forward and now you start to have these societies that realize that certain mushrooms get you high. And at low doses that actually increases your eyesight. And so that makes you a more effective forager if you consume low doses of psilocybin. And at higher doses it creates more of a religious-like experience, or a community-like experience. So it would be like a bonding thing for the tribe. And higher doses like I said its a religious experience  youre taking in all kinds of new information. And so theres a theory that thats why humans evolved! To have such large brains. Because theres this unexplained period in history where our brains were small small small small small, then all of a sudden our brains exploded! And thats the neo-frontal cortex! Thats responsible for language, symbolism, higher critical thinking, religious ideas. And so I tease with that idea just a little bit there, and then theres all these examples of different tribes who worship the mushroom in different ways, or have ceremonies with it or whatever. And Bitcoins kind of the same way! Its sort of this mysterious thing that people feel like they discovered something when they find it! You want to evangelize it as soon as you get it! And so theres all kinds of parallels with the religious side. And now some people  we live in a very secular society now so a lot of people arent really into religionthats fine, Im not either! However, from the religious angle in Bitcoin, people would try to say, Oh! Youre so religious! Youre zealous! Youre tribal! Thats true, right! But they try to use that as a bad thing! If Im investing in an upstart money that is attempting to overthrow the incumbent dollar and all the power that comes with it  I want crazy religious people to defend this network, especially in the early days! Its like providing cover fire to get Bitcoin through the door. Once it gets to a certain size, it will become too big to fail, and so the religious community around it is massively massively important. Guys like Michael Saylor realize this  he coined the term the cyber hornets. [24:45] I think thats quite apt! Yeah and now here we are: a bunch of crazy people overthrowing the legacy system peacefully! And its attracting the smartest, most interesting people on the planet to this thing  this thing that somehow represents truth in a world without it! And it gives young people purpose! It just feels like the right thing to do! And it feels like something that humanity needs! So myself and many others find it very easy to dedicate most of our waking hours to this thing. And podcasts popping up everywhere, incredible writers  the industry is just flourishing! So its quite fun to be a part of it, I would say.", "image": null}

I feel like theyre written from two different people. I think theres many facets to brand it, Im just really curious  this is just like a drop in the bucket! The first book for me is a page-turner. I just gobbled it up! And you put it on your website  I love this  its a 58-minute read. I did it in an hour and fifteen or and hour and a half. But that to me was a page-turner!

So the first one is likein the great trilogies of the world, maybe this isnt the greatest trilogy, but Star Wars: A New Hope  and now were moving into the the Rhythms of History: The Empire Strikes Back! And we got this greater macro front that were dealing with. And I dont know what the third opus will be! But I really want to turn to the second one. And as we phase into that  you make a point though in the Mycelium of Money about Bitcoin getting through the great filter of crypto  and that religious fervor will help it survive. And I see that. But Im almost like, Screw crypto! This is whats gonna help us get through the great filter of humanity. So we have this birth of Bitcoin, but now we got this larger context that were all dealing with in these turnings. And to kind of speak on that, you put on the website, the turnings was a 50-minute read. I did it in about six hours over two days. I read like three paragraphs and then I had to go for a walk and think about things! We talk about how we go through time, and time is maybe not completely circular, maybe not completely linear. Ive heard [??? 27:43] say its more like a spear, continuing through time but theres a circular nature to it. But what are these turnings that were dealing with? And lets start from really wide out: what is a 90-year period of turning?", "image": null}

So just to comment quick on the great filter. This is just a fantastic framing I think, both for Bitcoin and  I like what you mention with regards to humanitys point here  it might be humanitys point. If someones not aware of what this is, its essentially asking the question of, If theres so many galaxies and so many planets around the world, why dont we see life around us? Why isnt there spaceships, why hasnt anyone visited us, why havent we seen any evidence? And the thesis is that, as life develops, there becomes these crucibles, these really hard challenges, and most species die out when they hit these challenges. It sort of filters out these species. So maybe there was a million humanoid-like species around the world, but they cant ever figure out how to get off their own rock, and so they eventually bomb themselves off with nukes. So that could be a great filter! Or maybe the great filter happened behind us! Maybe it was from single-cell to multi-cell organisms! Maybe that is really hard to do! And so theres single-cell organisms everywhere, but very few make it past that! We dont know! But its nice to think about. Now if we think about Bitcoin, I call the great filter of cryptocurriences the nation state. Many people call it the final boss. My framing there was, if your cryptocurrency doesnt feasibly stand a chance at surviving a state-level attack, then theres absolutely no point to continue. Because theyll let you get big, and up until the point where it matters, and then theyll squash you! And 99.999% of cryptocurrencies will not pass this filter. I think Bitcoin is the only one that I feel confident that it will! [29:47] Yeah I dont think anything else will at this point! Now lets transition to the Fourth Turning. For context this is a book written in 1996 by two demographers  they spent like 30 or 50 years studying demography, and they realized, Why! Theres all these patterns! And why are all these patterns coming up? They put this into a series of books. The Fourth Turning is one of those books. Its like the Cliff Notes of their book called Generations, which is like an encyclopedia of history and trying to find patterns. Most people think of time as a linear process. From a worse past to a better future. And thats sort of the culture today. You mention from the Jewish tradition they view it as a spiral? It goes upward over time? That makes sense. Thats actually a really good point: lots of ancient cultures had observed cycles of history! And the main one he measured was called the Saeculum, which is a long human life which happens to be between 8090 years. And for whatever reason every 8090 years we go through a crisis periodthis is typically war! So 8090 years ago we have World War II, before that we had the Civil War, before that we had the Revolutionary War. And so, Why does society have this crisis every 90 years? You dig in deeper and all of a sudden you realize that there are very clearly defined stages! In a 90 year period there are four stages, or four turnings. You can think of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. And theyre really a mood, and that mood would allow you to predict how society would respond to a catalyst. The mood helps you observe it from that way. And why are these moods created and why are they so observable? Because humans  just the way we emerge through culture and society  we have this repeating pattern of four different archetypes: the hero, the prophet, the nomad, the artist. And what happens is, based on the mood at the time when youre born, that will imprint you as a young person. So everyone in the milennial generation, we grew up during the unraveling, and now were all sort of the same. Then when we grow up, now as this well-defined generation, we start to act based on our upbringing in predictable ways, and we start to imprint history! And then the next generation, theyre dealing with all the crap that we put on them, and then they do the same thing! Ill pause there for a second to say that the thesis comes off as something that shouldnt be true. Many smart people bump into and they go, Ah! That kind of sounds like a stretch! I hear lots of counter-examples in my head! I cant even believe this! And what I would say to those people is that the book itself adds a lot of color. This thesis needs a ton of examples before it really clicks. And I try to summarize it in the essay, but if you are interested and you want to go deeper, I think the book will help solidify these. And now I see this runs pretty much everywhere! I cant help but observe through this! So it does seem fundamentally human. To bring us to present time, were right in the middle of the fourth turning, which is the crisis period! Thats essentially the realization that our institutions are crap! This is our politics, this is our healthcare, our governments, this is everything external to the individual  all the institutions are garbage! And then we all of a sudden realize, Wow! We really do need these institutions! What is healthcare was good? What is politics was good? So people had this collective realization that they want to re-do it and they want to have good institutions again! And you can look at that as supply and demand of order. A high supply of order means our institutions are doing well. A low supply of order means that our institutions are bad! So we have a low supply of order now, but as you enter the fourth turning, the demand for order is accelerating. Its rising very quickly! So that causes a frenzy, so any little spark in a fourth turning will be a really big deal, because were all primed to make that change. Were in the middle of a fourth turning now, we have probably about ten years left. It started in the 20082009 global financial crisis, and I predict it to end around 2030. I dont think weve hit the climax yet so I expect some turbulence here, and then I expect massive changes to politics, to healthcare, to money  everythings gonna change! And the analogue is 19291945. So that was the previous fourth turning. It started with a financial crisis in the stock market, the Great Depression, FDRs New Deal. Now we get into World War II and then we have Bretton Woods towards the end of World War II. All kinds of things changed: U.N., NATO, World Bank, IMF, social security, pensions  all kinds of crazy stuff was built there, and it was very unprecedented at the time! Now we take these things for granted, but at the time it was very radical! FDR ran off a campaign of fiscally sound budget! He was gonna balance the budget. And then a few years later hes passing the largest stimulus bill in history, and going full Keynesian and doing all kinds of crazy stuff! And the business people at the time  the governments in desperation  so theyre reaching for money wherever they can get it. And the business people at the time are going, Okay, we either print a lot of money, or theyre gonna start taking money from the people who have it! So all the business people are like, Yeah, fine! Devalue the currency! No problem! And of course we know that devaluing the currency hurts the little guy more than the people with assets. And that started deficit spending during a crisis. And now were deficit spending for fun! Everyone gets some points ! if youre Stephanie Kelton.", "image": null}

Lets do that. But first I have to address the point of how do we not participate? This one comes up a lot! It sort of feels like, if this is true, then our futures already written  so whats the point? Right? Thats sort of the thing that comes up. But the reality is, this is a very general approach. This is how society moves. You can think of it like, lets say theres twenty variables in how you measure society. How do we approach politics? How do we raise our kids? What is the supply and demand of order? Are we individualistic or communistic? Each one of these are on a pendulum that just swings over time. And the mood just determines  it gives you a rough angle: are we increasing in demand for order, or decreasing? Right? So its very broad! You cant avoid it at the society level, but at the individual level you can break every single one of these rules no problem! And many people do! But its really just how that group-think occurs.", "image": null}

So as a millennial myself Im a hero generation. Heroes grow up in the unraveling which is deregulation, everybodys getting drunk at the party, nobodys trying to end the party, this is the 90s, this is the early 2000s, the gettins good! Nobody really cares, nobody is asking questions  its fine, right? So millennials actually grow up over-parented, and the reason is because the previous generation  Gen X  they were under-parented, so a whole country in America hated kids because they were the black sheep kidsthey didnt have supervision, so they were bad boys! And so millennials are a response to that, saying, Wow! We gotta fix the kids! So millennials are super-overparented, you cant hurt em, were bubble boys, thirteenth-place ribbons, were all special, so we grow up with that, and then we also come of age during the crisis. This is the period where we rearrange the exterior world, we go to war, or we do something big enough to change everything. Thats sort of the millennial generation: thats the hero. The risk with the millennial generation is that theyre too orderly, theyre too collectivist. So were gonna flirt with socialism  we already are! And the millennials like that, they choose that! They unironically call each other comrade, which obviously if you pick up a history book you might realize how stupid that is. But they dont! And they actually prefer to over-index towards collectivism rather than individualism. And I feel  myself  I do not fit in with this model at all! Ive always been individual, go against the grain, do my own thing. However I see my peers very much like this! So thats sort of the thing here: I might break the mold, but my friends havent  its pretty obvious. So thats one generationlets go through a few more to actually get to your point. [39:44] The next generation is the prophet archetype. The prophet archetype is the baby boomers. These are the people who grew up, they were born after World War II. Everything was given to them after World War II  this was Pax Americana, white picket fences, the gettins good, suburbs, equality is high, and then these little spoiled kids who got everything, they grow up and they realize that the culture was sterile, its boring, theres no edge, the music sucks, nobodys doing anything spiritual, and so that prophet archetype comes of age and they cause an awakening. This is a rearranging of the interior world. And thats halfway through the cycle! So at the midway point we rearrange the interior world  at the end of the cycle in the fourth turning we rearrange the exterior world. And the prophet is responsible for that interior revolution. This is the psychedelic 60s, Civil Rights movement. Before this this would be the Puritans, and any religious movements  they happen at that period! They grow up, theyre principled, theyre narcissistic, theyre ideological. Theyre all hippies, right? Then that ended, they had a wake-up call, and then they became yuppies. And they were the individuals. They didnt actually want to grow up  they were the ones who raised Gex Xers without any supervision. That brings us to Gex X. Theyre the nomads, theyre practical, theyre like, Just tell me what to do and Ill do it! Theyre usually the ones who have to make the hard decisions, theyre the bad boys, theyre pragmatic, and throughout history they were never the key leaders. They were always the strong general who actually won the war. They put their head down, they did the things nobody wanted to do and they got it done. Versus the prophet  baby boomers  are more like sit in the tower and talk about how we see eye-to-eye or we dont. The Gen Xers dont actually do that much to culture compared to the prophet and the herothe millennials and the boomers. [41:52] And the reason is obviously that the prophets create the interior revolution, the heroes create the exterior revolution. And the nomads are just sort of part of the process and they bridge the gap. They dont actually cause too much changes in the world. Then the heroes, the millennials, and then you have the youngest generation now, this is Gen Z. This is the artist! Theyre caring, theyre indecisive, and artists grow up during a crisis. So theyre growing up right now. The previous artists were the silent generation. They grew up during the Great Depression, and they didnt want to rock the boat. They were conservative, they were silent, just in the background. And the young people today theyre growing up during the crisis so theyve become sort of withdrawn and sensitive and theyre conservative with their values. They dont want to risk anything because its pretty risky out there! And the Gen Z are gonna grow and be the empathetic mid-lifers, theyre great grandparents  fantastic grandparents! Yeah they dont really mold the world that much, but they prevent the Millennials from going overboard, because if the Millennials go overboard, the heroes go overboard, we have this very orderly, rigid society! Nazi Germany would be an over-indexing of the hero generation: were all on the same team, youre either with us or youre against us, strong central planning, no problem if we get rid of our liberties because this is good for everyone. And so theyre willing to make that sacrifice! The artist is a little bit different. They dont want to be under a strong rule like that! So thats the four, and interesting throughout history, they just go in that order: prophet, nomad, hero, artist. And each one influences the next, and the constellation  so is a hero old or young? Is an artist old or young? What stage of life are they at? That constellation of the archetypes is how you know what mood were in. Yeah thats a long-winded answer!", "image": null}

My children and everyones kids growing up during this crisis, this fourth turning  at the peak of it maybe  you know if it was a financial crisis I feel like I could just sweep that under the rug and not really affect that. This COVID crisis is a little more in their face. I read what you wrote about that generation and it rings true! But I dont want my kids to necessarily be meek or just standing off to the side. Maybe with great advice but not really taking action! The other thing  your background is in writing, communications, and it seems like theres a lot of references to Hollywood. When we talk about Gen X I think about Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men. That kind of archetype. And I wonder too, what if we got a strong individual as a president? Can that change these moments? Or is the president a reflection of the moment? And Im not trying to get political. Can strong individuals disrupt these generational turnings? And Ill go one step further: like Satoshi. We start going through the hard times, the good times  whatever the quote is  and a lot of people say were in the soft times, but Im like, But I dont know, Satoshis like the hardest dude out there! Hardest thing out there: man, woman, or group, that put this together and is gonna take us further, maybe into a fifth turning! You get to this later in the article. But can strong people interrupt these things?", "image": null}

However theyre not all like that! You have a massive influence on your kids! But you just know the gravity wants to pull your kids that way. And if you know that you can sort of steer around it. Also with the artist, they become adults in the first turning, which historically thats a time of peace, high equality  things are really good! And so theyre gonna hit their 20s post-crisis, and theyre gonna be potentially in a much better world! So each generation sort of has their trade-offs, and they get the crisis out of the way early! The boomers, theyre all trying to retire right now and theyre gonna find out pretty quickly that they dont have as much retirement money as they thought they did! So each generation has its own struggles. [46:28] Regarding the strong man, the president. Thats an interesting point! In the fourth turning, we have a strong demand for order, and what that usually manifests as is a very strong president! This is the archetypal big man with a stick. Hes the alpha male, when times are tough, the biggest, strongest guy gets to make the decisions and everyone falls in line. Its very human! In a sense Trump does display this: he has bravado hes loud, hes a bulldog, and so many people say, You know its not working! We want a strong president who will just make decisive bold actions! Another thing, interestingly, is during all fourth turnings, what ends up happening is theres a great champion who leads us out of the dark night! And a great champion is usually an older person whos in a leadership position  usually a president in the US  and they do the hard things and they rally the troops, and they have incredible support from the populace to vote for them! And that person is the one who makes the hard decisions. What I dont know is, I dont think Trump was our great champion. I dont think Biden will be our great champion. So maybe our next president is the one that actually takes us out of this. And if thats true, we might have a dark period here for four years, because we want our great champion as soon as possible, because thats when the mood shifts and we go, Okay were rallying around this, were gonna make it happen with this guy! And thats when the change occurs, because you need to get everyone on the same page in order to make these massive changes! And historically war is the only thing that motivates people to make huge changes.", "image": null}

I do have a question around that. The anatomy of the fourth turning, so where were at now. You wrote, Welcome to winter, a time of fire and ice. The supply of social order is still falling, but the demand for order is steadily rising. Although not required, fourth turnings historically end with total war. This was one of those moments where I put the book down and I went for a long walk. This was the sixth or seventh walk! You talk about how COVID is the thing that will bring us together to get us through the turning, and you question whether its a strong enough moment of unison. It doesnt seem to unify. And you say war is usually that thing, but maybe war is not gonna happen here now and I think I agree because countries are turning inward. Theyre no longer pillaging outwardly. But I do think its war-like turning inward on their own. My latest thought is that the country that does the best job at feasting inward will then take that superpower outward. Via cyberwar, psychological warfare, information and misinformation warfare. I dont want to get too dark, but like, where do you think were going over the next few years or really ten years, before we get out of this?", "image": null}

I think just looking, if you zoom way out, the trend is toward totalitarianism, and right now every nation state is playing this game. Its not like we can point to the Axis of Evil or the rise of Nazi Germany as the bad guys. Right now every single nation is grasping for as much power as possible, almost as if they cant help themselves, and so it is pretty concerning. Ill get to what I think is gonna happen, but before that lets do a morphology of a crisis. What are the stages in each 22-year fourth turning period. So all fourth turnings start with a catalyst. And this is a defining moment, its very clearly a before and an after moment, and this would be the 08/09 financial crisis. After the dot-com leading up to 08, not much had changed all through the 90s up to 08, and then all of a sudden, everything changed in 08! This is Occupy Wall Street, you see Obama runs on Hope and Change. Prior to that its like, Lets keep doing what were doing! After 08 its like, We gotta make a change! So that was the catalyst. Then theres a regeneracy period, and thats realizing that, Okay, times have changed. Now theres a new force, a counter-entropy that gets people involved and active. This is things like Bernie Sanders, the rise of Democratic Socialism, Social Justice Warriors, this whole new counter-culture to the previous culture. This is mostly led by the populist Left thats leading the culture of the day. They define the rules of engagement from a culture standpoint, and I would say that around 2012 we were firmly in that! Then the next point is the climax. This is the big one. This is bombs being dropped on Pearl Harbor, this is Paul Revere shots heard around the world, rallying the troops, this is the Civil War, etc. Typically  in March I thought the climax was going to be COVID. I thought it was going to be this big thing, it sucks, everyone rallies together and we get through it and that marks the climax. But now like you already alluded to I think its just ripping us apart. Its become this hyper-politicized thing. I dont even know whats going on there! It just feels like a power grab at this point. So I think its just gonna be fuel that leads to a larger crisis. Typical in fourth turning, its not like its one thing and everythings normal. One small crisis leads to another crisis which leads to another crisis until the whole thing topples over. So I see COVID as the starting point for ramping up towards the real climax, and after the climax theres a resolution period where the scores have been set, we rearrange all the pieces, and we start on a new path. But how is this gonna play out? I think theres four things: (1) it could be COVID. I dont think so, I dont think its big enough. (2) We could have total war, but it seems like no one is in the mood for total war. However maybe in the next five years we have these new central bank digital currencies, China is trying to assert their dominance, maybe China oversteps their bounds and the US and China get into a little tango. Thats possible. (3) It could also be a black swan event, something unpredictable. Terrorism, some sort of weird hack that causes something to happen. (4) Or it could be civil war. And sadly I think this is the most likely! Theres a lot of stats that back this up, things like 50% of people said that they think that violence is justified in order to get your political war passed. 26% of people said that theyre willing to have their state peacefully secede from the United States. So theres all these little metrics: the divide between the cities and the rural people, individualists versus collectivists. Theres all these tension points. Theyre getting worse, theyre not getting better. The politicians are actually using this to their own advantage! Then you combine it with the media  everythings feeding on this division! And whats scary is that all it takes is one little spark and you could see some really really nasty stuff around our country. Now it will not be a North vs. South clearly defined thing. It will be this confusing quagmire of you dont know whos who, you have the separatists over there and the group over there and weird flag this and that, martial law, transportations bad, foods disrupted. Just a general feeling of unsettledness, and various people will be freedom fighters and whatever that looks like. Weird militias coming around. Thats what I sadly think is the most likely  I hope we dont reach that! You mention Bitcoin as the fifth turning. And so I do think theres a chance here! Bitcoin is unique. It sort of serves as an institution. And what we need now are strong institutions. So what if Bitcoin was this thing that we could architect around? Its fair, it sort of appeases the Millennials because its fair  its not twelve old white guys running the money. It is a network, its a community. So theoretically that could be the thing! What it does uniquely is  were also in a bad economic situation as well as all this social unrest. So Bitcoin is sort of this life raft. You can get on the life raft instead of sinking on the Titanic. And the quicker we get people on this life raft, the fewer people are gonna be desperate and flailing and backed against a corner which is when people become violent. Rational people dont become violent but if push comes to shove, normal rational people do become violent! I think Bitcoin both at the individual level  because you dont have to go down with the ship financially  and at the society level, whether thats a corporation protecting their person in power, whether thats Iran getting around sanctions and monetizing their energy assets in order to pay for imports in Bitcoin because the US doesnt let them play in the financial system, or another nation that might just wanna not be under a Dollar hegemony. Or their countrys going bad and they have nothing to lose and they just YOLO into Bitcoin! I think all of these things just reduce the amount of suffering, and reduce the amount of people getting desperate. And so Im optimistic that Bitcoin could actually be the institution we need right now!", "image": null}

Bitcoin as an institution makes me think of Nick Szabos piece on social scalability. I thought that that was fascinating! Lets look at social media, though. Im curious if you think social media is a force for good or not? And lets start with the notion thats stipulated that social media decentralizes information and news and communications and thats been a force for good. I think thats kind of clear to a certain extent. I mean theres some negative externalities. But lets look at this question through maybe like the 2024 presidential election, and Ill frame it like this: social media I think will eventually get compromised, not that the three networks ABC, NBC, CBS were compromised, but that they were centralized. Youve got one narrative the country was feasting on one thing, one water cooler conversation. Social media is that now, but youre really talking about two algorithms. Lets look at 2024 and what if the election was like Jack Dorsey versus Mark Zuckerberg?", "image": null}

It seems like were in a situation where the most popular person wins. I think Trump sort of expanded the Overton window, meaning, whats the conversation that were comfortable having? People think we have this choice, we can choose  anyone can become president! Not really! Theres this extremely narrow band between the Left and the Right, and thats who were actually voting on. But Trump is this external figure that didnt really fit into the band, and he showed that it was possible to strong-arm your way in without playing by the traditional rules. So I think going forward  Joe Biden is obviously a president of the 90's  he doesnt represent anything new or forward-leaning, or of this new paradigm. But I think 2024 like you mentioned  Dorsey versus Zuckerberg  I think that type of thing is possible! The tech companies are becoming more powerful than most countries. Theyre now starting to play the game with the big boys! They want to launch Libra  they kind of got put in their place with that. But theyre getting old now. Theyre getting powerful. So I think thats very real. You mentioned the algorithm, and I think were gonna see a lot more algorithms running our lives  they already do! But its gonna get way more sophisticated! Especially when you see these central bank digital currencies being released. What that does is it gives  well the Fed and the government already are merging  so central banks and states are the same from now on. Were just accepting that. And what theyre gonna do is give us all central bank digital currencies  our phone is our money. Maybe theyll try to put chips in us, hopefully not! What it does is it gives them granular control over individuals in the economy. They can say, You have too much money on the sideline, Im gonna give you 10% negative interest rates until you put that money to work, then they can give your kid as student maybe 5% interest to encourage savings. And so that just is too much power for the state, and the central banking class loves it! They think that theyre the smartest guys in the room and they think that they can manage the economy from the ivory tower. When in reality the economy is a complex beast that no one can manage! So Bitcoin is sort of saying, We dont want humans to politicize the money  we know where that gets us! It works for a short period of time then it gets corrupted, and we suffer. So Bitcoin is trying to be the thousand-year institution. The non-politicized monetary base which we can then architect around. I have no clue what 2024 will bring! What I would say is: forget everything you thought. Dont look backwards! Anything is on the table looking forward! So in this period of high volatility I think its smart for individuals to really do some assessment on your own life: where are your vulnerabilities, minimize your downside risk, essentially make yourself and your family antifragile, so that in the worst case scenario youre protected! That could be things like owning a second passport, owning Bitcoin, having a second job, not be over-leveraged with debt  all these different things. Minimize your downside risk and just plan ahead. Its too hard to say, but it will be volatile, and I think increasingly so for at least five years!", "image": null}

I would say that the American experiment is founded on principles that were way ahead of their time, and very clearly the best strategy for organizing at the time. What I dont know is, do we need these epically strong central states anymore? And Im gonna draw on the Sovereign Individual thesis a little bit here, which is that, for the Industrial Revolution period, whoever had the biggest army was the leader of the world. Previously this was the Navy  like the sun never sets on the British Empire because they had the strongest Navy. Then it became Americas world after World War II. Weve gotten nukes and aircraft carriers guarding the oceans. Essentially what was rewarded was the state which had the largest capacity for violence! However, in the Information Age, which were obviously in now, the whole logic of violence shifted! Now a big states actually not that important, because having a big state is very expensive to maintain. Instead the defense  or the little guy  has the advantage in the Information Age. And thats through things like cryptography and Bitcoin! These are asymmetric technologies that benefit defense versus offense. And so in that world, I see  bringing it back to America  I see the fracture of America actually as a long-term positive thing! I would like to see smaller states with more control. How are you gonna govern Chicago and Western Illinois? They have nothing in common! And so why would the state do that? Maybe you should fracture it a little bit more! Why would D.C. make the same law that applies to cowboys in Wyoming and people who live in Silicon Valley? They dont have anything in common! And so I think we should fracture governance into the smallest unit possible. Now I dont know how practically a secession would go or a fracturing of the US  historically theyve been very violent! [1:03:25] You know, Catalonia tried to break away from Greater Spain. That was met with pretty aggressive response from the central government in Spain. So I dont know how it will work out. In the long run its better, but nobody wants to give up their land!", "image": null}

So people can gird themselves before we can move to some more optimistic topics. Obviously protect your wealth with Bitcoin, minimize your debt, live below your means, have multiple sources of income, flag theory  were gonna have a show with Katie Ananina coming out  so get that second passport, go where youre treated best, maybe set your business up somewhere else, go have your recreation somewhere else, spend money where its cheap, dont be cancelable, dont invest in politics du jour, be self-reliant, become technical, become super-literate, do things for yourself, dont trust, verify, find a community, build your citadel you get into and stay vigilant! But lets turn to more optimism like, we get through this by hook or crook: what are we looking at in 2030? Is it a Renaissance? Is Bitcoin the biggest part of that?", "image": null}

Were approaching the peak here. And historically in fourth turnings it can resolve in a really positive way or it can just be a tragedy. And I dont think that storys been written yet. However I am optimistic because we have Bitcoin! And if we didnt have Bitcoin I would be extremely pessimistic right now! All trending forces are a centralization of power, and were all farmed by our fiat overlords. Thats the trend. And as a personal freedom advocate  I put that freedom as among the highest ideals  thats pretty scary! But thankfully we do have Bitcoin and Bitcoin is uncompromising! The state cannot do anything to Bitcoin. They can try but it will backfire! And so I believe thats sort of a moral force for society. It puts restraint on these overreaching governments  it takes a little power away and forces them not to misbehave, because Bitcoiners can leave with the capital and no one can stop people. You can go get another passport. Theres gonna be a tremendous amount of innovation coming out of Bitcoin! And if you shun the innovation, youre hurting your own country. And if you accept innovation, youre gonna go into a brighter future! So what I would say is: Im very bullish on Bitcoiners. I think its the best group of people on the planet right now, [its] the force that we want to back , the horse we want to ride through the fourth turning as well, and if Bitcoin continues its path  like this year I think things have accelerated  if it continues like it does now, I think Bitcoin has a real shot at turning the world around! Were gonna go through a dark time no matter what, but the next period, the next journey  if Bitcoins a part of this which is seems like it will be  I think we do have a chance for a Renaissance! You get the money sorted and you give people a chance to be more productive, and just that foundational element of fixing the money will have all kinds of downstream effects to improve our planet. From unlocking intellectual capital from people who are locked out of the financial system  they can save their money in Bitcoin  from removing all the time theft from inflation, so normal people can actually save their money in an asset that preserves the fruits of their labor. Capital preservation is what creates society! And right now were doing the opposite: were hot potatoing our money as quickly as possible! Were buying just-in-time plastic junk that lasts two weeks then we throw it away. So I think Bitcoin is the thing that we need right now in society. Its perfect timing for that pendulum to swing the other way. So if that occurs, yeah we could call the next cycle the Bitcoin Renaissance, which is a phrase that Brady says in Bitcoin, also a co-worker of mine at Swan, likes to mention. And I think thats very true! Now what I dont know is, will it happen fast, or are we talking a couple of generations until we see this Renaissance? And thats really hard for me to predict! Again time is not linear! No matter what we predict now will be wrong! And in ten years well look back and the world will be very different. Again I dont think its predictable, but keep fighting for Bitcoin  thats the only thing I can think of that keeps me sane during the process  like Nic Carter said, youre building the cathedral one brick at a time, and we might not even be alive by the time its complete! That pursuit  something greater than ourselves  thats a force thats needed right now! It gives me purpose! It gives many other people purpose. Theres nothing to do besides brick by brick!", "image": null}

Theres lots of ways mushrooms can help. Theyre good for your yard, healing the environment, cleaning up pollution, NASAs experimenting with Mycelium to grow moon bases. You can train the Mycelium to create the shape you want, and Mycelium can actually block radiation! So I see a merging with space travel. Mycelium is gonna really be useful for colonizing Mars  probably start with the moon. Thats a couple ideas! Now at the personal level, this can be through supplements to improve your health. Mushrooms are  the molecules in them are considered adaptogens  you can think of it like it gives your body whatever it needs! If youre too stressed it will help with that. If you have too much inflammation it will help with that. If you have not enough inflammation it will help with that. It helps your body find homeostasis, equilibrium in the body. Theyre great for your immune system, your sleep, your mind, your body, so I would recommend everyone should be taking a mushroom multivitamin. Just a broad spectrum capsule of mushrooms that is fine, its not too expensive. And it really helps your body deal with stress and stay healthy. Most people claim these are miracle drugs. I tend to be in that camp! However the science is just catching up. In general, studying health is hard so youre not gonna find the hardest hitting science on mushrooms yet. But certain compounds like Lions Mane has been shown to improve dementia and Alzheimers  very clearly, massive results there. Other ones help with cancer, physical fitness, etc. And then theres another whole compound of mushroomsthe psychedelic mushrooms. They contain a compound called psilocybin which is very similar to one of our neurotransmitters, seratonin, which regulates mood and several different things in our day to day life. The psilocybin mushrooms are very interesting because theyre great tools for healing and introspection and exploration. I feel very strongly about these compounds because it benefited me in my personal life and thousands of other people. And theyre starting to become legalized in the US. And so what were gonna see is psilocybin therapy centers just like you go to see therapist or you go on a retreat or in previous times youd go on a religious quest or go see the temple or whatever. These things are gonna pop up and theyre gonna be like nature retreats that also involve eating some psilocybin mushrooms! Im really optimistic about that  the world needs this type of healing. Also people are microdosing these things as sort of a mood enhancer or creativity booster. Thats also very effective. But they are illegal. Theyre not for everyone  treat these things with respect. Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer! Do your own research! Dont trust, verify! All those things apply here! But theyre very important right now. Theyre also criminally understudied! So if youre a budding young person and youre curious about this stuff, go into mycology! Theres twenty Nobel prizes in mycology yet to be unlocked! It will help us in all of our future challenges and tons that we have right now, so thats gonna be a big one!", "image": null}

Its about complexity theory and complex systems, it blurs science with data with studying complex systems. And Bitcoin is a complex system!

You blur these things with how human civilizations grow and what scaling principles can we take from all human civilizations? That ones pretty mind bending! Im just dipping my toes in so Im no expert there. Thats two. I like Hidden Forces as well, with Demetri Kofinas. I dont like all his episodes, but I think its a great one.

You really dont! Because theres just like so many millions of lines of code on the inside and all it takes is one bad line of code to create an .EXE that could cause people to steal your private keys, right? And so the other half of trust is it cant be something so complicated thats intractable for you to audit or to understand at the end of the day. [05:51] So trustability almost becomes a property of a system that you have to design in from the top. When you talk about trustability from this absolute, self-sovereign standpoint, this trust from the standpoint of like, Oh this is an Apple iPhone  I trust it because of a brand! Right? But I dont  that in and of itself is more of like a faith, its not a fact-based trust. Its based upon social opinions and repercussions if they violate the trust. Oh, its against their corporate interest currently to violate the trust, whatever it is  because of the branding and whatnot. But thats not a brass tacks, physics-based trust. When Im talking about trust from this standpoint, If you want to stay and have an evidence based thread based on things that you can measure with your own two eyes and own two hands and convince yourself on from the bottom-up, a system has to be designed to be simple enough to facilitate that within a humanly-reasonable amount of time! To say that youre gonna spend 5 years auditing your browsers source code is not feasible because 5 years from now youre gonna have patches that are gonna be absolutely essential for you to be secure anyways, and for you to audit those patches will take another 7 months or whatever it is . So you have this eternal cycle of patches you have to keep looking at and you never get any work done, and also you never really catch up with the current status quo. And thats one of the problems with having an open source system that is too complicated. Its not physically possible to get to a point where you can trust everything inside of it!", "image": null}

Basically at the end of the day, they trust their label. Like some piece of equipment that they have been using for 20 years and has never failed them. Its kind of the trust inside the label that consumers have, but I think that you have big audiences that dont trust the label  one of them of course is the Bitcoiners!

You can worry yourself sick worrying about these types of things and never eat, but at some point I just have to trust that this restaurant is gonna serve me good food! And maybe the argument is that the chef eats the food too! At the very least theyll be as sick as I will be, and they have a self-interest in it, right? Thats more of a sociological-type trust. Theres a point where its appropriate and you have to fall back on it, but I feel like on the technology front, weve just surrendered so much to just black boxes with no explanation on the inside!

One is obviously, do you even trust the base design itself? Like, does this piece of hardware  the manufacturer that makes it  are they reliable? Does it have the features they say it does? Does it not have extra features they didnt tell you about? These are sort of the issues you have. And then you have the specific instance of the hardware that youre working with. And this is a key point of difference between software and hardware. In software, you have cryptographic tools to transfer trust. We can hash things and we can sign them and we can verify them very quickly at the point of view. So if Nicolas goes ahead and signs off on a package and says, Ive looked at the source code and this is good and you can use it  you can reproduce his efforts by hashing it in a way and checking the signature and you can say, Well at least I know that I have exactly that piece of code that he signed off on and Im using that. When it comes to hardware, you cant do that! Theres no hash function for hardware. Theres no easy way for you to snap a finger and say, this is exactly the Bitcoin wallet that the manufacturer intended me to have! You know, what if someone put a small chip on the inside to record your keystrokes? What if theres a little exfiltration device on the inside to exfiltrate your keys or whatever it is? These types of things do happenthey sound a little crazy, but I mean there was recently some presentations at this years CCC where they showed some, again, live implants in the wild, like just people finding them inside of their [secure?] phones and whatnot. They do happen! And thats also a level of thing to worry about, particularly when you start talking about things like Bitcoin which have inherent value in and of itself.", "image": null}

It was very well said! And basically your goal seemed to [be to] move the verification of hardware at the place of use. So how far do you feel you are from this ideal with the Precursor and also with the Betrusted environment that you are working on right now?", "image": null}
{"title": "SLP241 Bunnie \u2014 Precursor: Open Source Hardware \u2014 (Feat.

So what Nicolas is referring to is that, in the security world we have this phrase called the Time of Check versus Time of Use problem. So if you go ahead and check that your browser was okay on the server, and then you went ahead and downloaded and someone man-in-the-middled your download and you didnt check it again  thats called a Time of Check versus a Time of Use. It was okay in the server but the Time of Use is actually after you download itsomeone can go ahead and modify it before you use it. And so in software theres a well known principle: you always try to check it right before you use it, the exact copy youre gonna run is the thing that youve hashed and checked against the signature! Not some other copy in the cloud or on your disk. [12:21] In hardware, similar concept: theres a Place of Check versus a Place of Use. So one of the more laughable suggestions Ive seen is that people talk about like, Oh these sovereign fabs! Lets build a foundry on our countrys soil, and that will help solve this problem of trust in supply chain! Its laudable on a number of fronts, but I think its more of a political stunt to try and create local jobs. Which is fine, you can do that! But the reason why it doesnt help the Place of Check, Place of Use problem is that its been established that a common vector for exploits is the couriers who deliver the package, orif youre buying off of a distribution site like Amazon  the customers who buy it tamper with it and then return it back! So people can buy like a hard drive, remove the tamper evidence seals, modify the firmware, implant something inside, and then restore the seals, and then send it back to Amazon. And then the distributors like, Okay! Well they returned the product! All the seals are in place! Well just resell this to someone else! You cant target who it goes to, but the fact of the matter is youre starting to put these devices out which have these implants on the inside. [13:22] And these are vectors that are completely close to the end-user. Theres nothing about where the chips are made or where the factories are located or whatever it is! So you do all of this effort to create billions of dollars to spend on a sovereign fab, and at the end of the day the Place of Check is not the Place of Use. You still have this big disconnect in terms of a very trivial exploit path. And when I say trivial I mean also part of the problem is if you think about the incentives involved, youre trying to ship maybe say a Bitcoin wallet and you want to secure $1 Million of Bitcoin on it, and the person delivering it to you  how much are they being paid? Whats their stake in guaranteeing the integrity of that packet? That person  whats their vulnerability to a bribe or to being distracted? The stakeholders dont have aligned interests in terms of getting you the level of integrity of the hardware that youre expecting to secure your secrets with. And so this becomes the existential problem that Precursor is trying to deal with. I havent mentioned in detail what Precursor is yet on the podcast! For listeners who dont know, Precursor is an open hardware development platform for secure applications. And its goal is to address these issues were talking about so far in this podcast. You can go to precursor.dev, thats a website and itll bounce you to our current crowdfunding site where we just closed a round of crowdfunding for it. And we plan on shipping the product in the late part of this year, 2021. And the idea is to explore the primitives and the necessary tools that we need to close this Time of Check to Time of Use gap. One of the cool parts about Precursor is that we use whats called a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) as the computing element, which means that instead of trusting a third-party to create your CPUwhich has your instructions, which has your encodings, which has all the debug backdoors, all this sort of stuff  normally we just trust ARM or Intel or someone like this to just create this CPU and we just take it as a black box! Crazy that we take it as a black box, but we all do! We dont know what hidden instructions are on the inside of it, right? Instead of that, youre given the source code description of a RISC-V CPU, and you can compile it yourself into the gates on the FPGA and then load it onto the device yourself, if you want to be able to get to that level of trust. It takes a little more effort than using the stuff right out of the box, but the point is that you can do ityou are empowered to do it. And then people say, Well, but of course, what if the FPGA itself has a piece of closed source silicon? You know, its turtles all the way down! This is true. Its true that there are still attack surfaces on everything  you cant seal all the doors. But, weve really moved the goal posts forward! Because in the case of just getting a closed source CPU blob, someone could put a whole hidden instruction on the inside that just sort of socks away some bytes of memory into a small register somewhere inside the chip, and itd be very hard to discover this! You know, you could put a lock on it so you cant fuzz it out, but it can only be activated with certain instruction sequences  whatever it is. And it doesnt take a lot of gates to do that sort of thing, right? With the source code at least with our device, you can look at it and see [that] none of these things exist! [16:18] The instructions decoders are decoding only the instructions we say they are! No more, no less! And theyre doing it properly! And then once you compile it down to the gates on the FPGA, the compilation process itself is a little bit random. We cant predict where the critical bits will land inside of this several hundred-thousand gate device. And because of that unpredictability, it makes it very difficult for someone a priori to implant something that will pull out that one critical bit. So now, any implant that tries to pull out or replicate what would be a trivial attack on a closed source piece of silicon, now becomes a very large  youre almost like implanting every bit of your RAM, you could imagine, as opposed to just looking at a single word bank at a well known location  now were talking about orders of magnitude [greater] difficulty in terms of executing implants and detectability on fundamental parts such as the CPU, and the structure and the integrity of it.", "image": null}

Im covering a lot of ground in a short period of time here! Lets tease apart two aspects of the design: (1) is the physical device itself and (2) is whats inside the actual chips. So lets start with the physical device itself, and so this is actually a little bit of a side jog from when we were talking about Intel and AMD. So first you have to trust the physical device itself is correct before we talk about anything else. Precursor is made to facilitate that type of inspection  its very simply constructed: a single-sided circuit board. We give you reference images of it so you dont have to be technical to understand where youre going: you just have to visually do a diff between the two things to see if anythings different on the inside. And its simply constructed, so its not like you need crazy amounts of microscopes or whatever it is to do that type of thing. But that only gets you as far as a very gross, physical, like, What is this extra little black blob here with wires on it? Is that supposed to be on there? No! Okay, so that must be an implant on the microphone or something like this. Thats the kind of thing you can tell at that level. Now, when you get to the CPU level, that happens all inside those little black blobs of epoxy! [19:02] And in order to inspect those, you would have to have a desktop-sized microscope that costs several million dollars. Its not practical for end-users to do that. And so our answer to that is that we then turn the CPU into almost basically a software description of a CPU. So all of those tricks we talked about in terms of signing and hashing and so forth, we could have a third-party auditor look at our CPU code  the description of our architecture, our equivalent description of an Intel or ARM CPUwe give it to you at a level so that someone like Nicolas could look at [it]. He could sign off and say, This is good! You can take that code and confirm the integrity all the way to the point of your house. And then you can compile that code yourself into the gates of one of these black boxes. Now were all admitting that we cant know whats inside the black box, but where the key trick happens is that inside the black box, when we give you our gates, its a generic sea of gates! There are 30,00040,000 LUTs on the inside, and we dont know what does what! Theyre all just generic  they do simple operations like Adds and Subtracts  a little bit simpler than that, but lets just say its at that level. And then we have a program that maps our description of the CPU to those LUTs (look-up tables) on the inside. And that mapping is pseudo-random. Basically you cant  very small changes in the source  we basically put a random seed on the inside, is the trick that we use. And it foils peoples attempt to take that generic sea of gates and bias it away, that would allow someone to exploit the code that we put on the inside. Thats the basic argument. So we basically take the hard, gnarly hardware problem of knowing whats inside of our CPU  we turn it into a software problem  and we put it into a generic sea of gates which has a mapping property that makes it difficult for someone, in advance, to predict where your exact implementation will go. And thats where the security property comes from. [21:04] If you [run] the numbers, it becomes cryptographically secure at the complexity levels that were talking about.", "image": null}

So now theres a third or fourth dimension of security which is tamper-resistance. Up until this point we were talking about, Have we taken the red pill yet? Basically  are we in reality? If someone gives you a piece of hardware thats been tampered with, youre sort of in the Matrix! You cant break out of it  theres nothing you can do! Thats the existential question that Precursor has been trying to answer is like, Are we living in the real world, or has someone put us in a cage and we dont even realize it? The second aspect is, once you know youre in the real world, how do you know that youre continuing to live in that world, and that someone hasnt tampered with it, and also, can you basically leave your wallet somewhere, walk away, and know that  even if someone stole it  your secrets are safe? Thats the tamper-resistance aspect. I can go into this for days! This is a huge subject of research in the silicon industry. But as a general principle: if you talk to anyone who has practiced extraction of secrets from silicon  who has pulled out keys from silicon, and Ive done this, and some of my colleagues have done this  our general opinion is that even the super-ultra-secure tamper-resistant guys, theyll hold up maybe like a day or two against a well-equipped lab. Theres just no amount of  and if you get into the circles and you start talking [with] the guys about the unpublished work, you would just  your jaw would drop! The most powerful technique recently is this technique called Backside Imaging. So it used to be that you had to attack from the topside-down and you had to [strip] the wires  it was actually a very difficult attack! Now actually a lot of chips these days, they thin them down before they put them in the device to make the devices thinner. The chips are so thin that you can actually see the parasitic photons that the transistors emanate coming out of the backside of the chip! So the chip, as mounted, if you just look at it with a very sensitive camera  and this is cryogenically cooled stuff so its not like everyday sorts of stuff  you can actually see the patterns of bits firing real-time without doing anything! You just turn it on and you can see the side-channel coming out of them! And because of this, even the most secure chips with all of these  they talk about secure meshes on top and PUFs (physically unclonable function)you can just turn them on! Theyre just emittingout the backside  all their secrets! Right? You just have to have a good enough device [that] depacks it well enough to see it. So this is where were at today! [These are the] tamper-resistance issues that we have today! From that respect, I have an article that I wrote thats part of my Precursor campaign thats a deep dive into this. When you realize how bad [this] situation is, the problem is that weve had such a long-running streak of untruth in advertising in this, people dont even know how scared they should be of whats on it! [26:36] So just the goal I have with Precursor is to be brutally honest as to what we can and cannot do. So I took my own design  another one of my lives: Ive done things like extract the security keys from the original XBOX, Ive done a lot of security work in the past  I took my best crack at my own design, and of course I found a problem! This is not a surprise, and it turns out that the strength of Precursor from a tamper-resistance standpoint is as strong as the epoxy that you can put on it. Basically, if you can break off the epoxy and the metal shieldand youre a skilled attacker  you can extract the keys with enough time. A couple hours. But at this point youll definitely know that someone has attacked it  you would see the evidence of the attack. It does take some time. But I would say thats roughly equivalent to about the security of a lot of devices offered. And honestly people say, Oh, my smartphone is so secure! A lot of them have just  plug-in a USB cable, run the software  its jailbroken. So thats a zero-touch break. [27:33] Theres no evidence of any sort of tampering with that type of break issue. So at least [the Precursor] doesnt have any issues that are that bad, but yeah if someone physically took your device and they had a specially designed CNC mill to remove the epoxy from it, they could read out the keys. And to react to that I introduced a self-destruct mechanism inside the device. If you are very paranoid, you can program what are called Volatile Keys  theyre RAM-backed. Unfortunately, it really doesnt fit the use-case of archival storage of high-value secrets like Bitcoin, because the problem is that if you forget to charge your battery, you lose everything in the wallet! Its not the right solution for that, but for example if you have a device and its to communicate with friends and you want to keep it very secure and if it gets into the wrong hands you want to make sure all the comms are wiped  thats actually perfect because the moment the battery is not charged anymore, all the keys are gone, and everything on the device is unreadable. So that gives you a bounded sort of risk on very volatile, high-value secrets, but the problem in Bitcoin of storing long-term non-volatile secrets  so like your wallet keys, that type of thing  its a very hard problem!", "image": null}

So when you have this situation where vendors are doing things that are already sketchy and you cant  how are you supposed to find malware in that situation, right? So I thought about that for a long time and I was like, Look, we really need to solve the problem! And this is where I started arriving at the principles of simplicity, openness  these types of things. This is kind of the genesis of a lot of these principles was that effort. And so the direct target of that has always been supporting activists, journalists  people who are working in dangerous situations who need very high levels of security and theyre up against state-level actors who have very little penalty for killing the person in question, and a lot of motivation to do it! Were talking about high-stakes poker here, right? [30:25] Which is why the Precursor design is so incredibly paranoid! And the goal was to make a product called Betrusted and we want it to be just out-of-the-box simple. Safe defaults  you didnt have to be a tech wizard to use it. Basically, if you had one of these devices [and] you could do a basic amount of inspection on it, you knew you were okay! Precursor came about because we got the hardware of that finished, but the software for it is still a long way off! Software, it turns out, is very hard, its very complicated, and thats where all the bugs start to come in. Thats where all the scary, unknowable complexities start to happen! And writing really good software thats simple, auditable, and understandable takes a very long time! And so we made the decision that theres other people in other communities who may benefit from a piece of hardware thats designed to this level of security and paranoia. For example, people who just want to manage passwords. People want authenticator tokens they can trusttrue second-factors. People want Bitcoin wallets. These types of things are applications that could probably use the same hardware platform that weve created. And so we branded it Precursor to make it very clear that it is a predecessorits a harbringer of other things. Its something that you add your code to [in order] to become that application. And thats why we bill it as an open source hardware development platform. Its not a product in and of itself! And the idea is: put it out there and maybe other communities will find thingsthis is part of the reason why Im on your podcast! To let your people know about this possibility and maybe get interest and see what things I didnt expect could be useful to run on a platform like Precursor!", "image": null}

But there problem is [that] they still have the CPU problem that I described to you in that, like, We dont know what goes in  I think that theyre ARM-based CPUs from vendors that dont share the source code of the CPU. So theres a layer there that they cant get into in terms of trust and reliability. And also they arent on the reduced attack surface train  theyre not about the simplified trust-inspectability. Theyre more looking to replace your full-featured smart phone with a device that has a better trustability aspect to it. But you still have the complexity problem in the devices. And thats a deliberate choice [that] users should be allowed to make! Like, I dont think that you can live your life practically in this complicated technological world with a device that is so simple that you could inspect it! Theres just sort of like this Faustian choice that we have to make as humans: we dont have enough time in our lifetimes to learn all of technology, but we need to learn enough to be able to secure ourselves! So the dichotomy Im sort of approachingat least personally  what I do is, theres a certain set of things that I do on devices that I dont know if they have something on the inside! But it also doesnt matter! Like, why not? Browsers are convenient, Intel computers are cheap, lets go ahead and use these things and do day-to-day things that dont matter. But then the things that I really do care about  the things that are risky and high-value, I then put into this [other] device that I trust. Thats the dichotomy that Im trying to move towards. So you actually would imagine a Librem or a PinePhone would work hand-in-hand with a Precursor device. You would actually carry both of them. One of them for your daily browser, and the other one for your security keys.", "image": null}

But I saw that you plan as well to have a custom-made file system for the Precursor with plausible deniability. And actually thats a very familiar concept for Bitcoiners because with Bitcoiners, one thing they are doing to protect themselves from extraction of secrets directly from the device  is that they choose a password on top of it. So to get the private key you need basically what is written in the device plus this password, and the password is never stored. But the nice thing as well is that in our protocol, if you put a different password you get a different wallet, so thats how we use plausible deniability. If I understand you, you are doing it at the OS level, right?", "image": null}

Thats right. Absolutely. So to clarify, we also would fully intend that you would have password unlocks. We dont rely fully on the devices security for anything at the end of the day. So yes the secondary passwords are important, and yes, we also intend to implement a tree of passwords if you will. So that the secrets will unravel over time. And I said the softwares really hard ! you know, plausible deniability is a very hard problem, and we are actually going all the way down to the file system level and re-implementing the file system to that even an attacker who has the ability to read your raw disk image out constantly could not tell that there were certain secrets on the inside. We make the free space of your disk look exactly like erased files. And so if you forget your password, you literally have deleted the file. Its literally the same operation. The operating system, to delete a file willif you request to do one  all it will do is just re-encrypt it to a random key and then delete the key. Thats what it does, right? The other trick that we plan to do is that, instead of every file being likenormally [when] youre managing a file it has a certain size, you open it, you scan through the file to position, you read itthats the story, like the positive extraction for a file. Our files are actually databases on the inside! So once you refer to them, you open them, they have keys and you can sort of query them for the contents. What this allows us to do is that as you type in more passwords to your system, we can actually merge in secure overlays. So your contact bookwhen you type in your initial password  will just have your everyday contacts: your Mom, your girlfriend, whatever it is, things that everyone knows that you have, right? And then, if you type in another password, it actually can  across all your files, all your applications, add an overlay to it of that particular password-linked contacts. Thats the goal! And so now in addition to that, you dont have to reload your applications or whatever it is, its just [that] you now see a new set of chat history and new things just appear. When you clear that password  they go away. And you can have multiple passwords set. And so the idea is that at some point in time, if someone says, I force you to show me these passwords. You have to unlock your device for you to enter this country, and show me everything! You enter your passwords that you remember at the time, and you hand it to them, and thats it! They cant say that there are more passwords or not more passwords, they could do a low-level disk scan  they wont find any evidence that theres files that are not decrypted or theres things that arent being accessed, because thats what the free space looks like! All the free space looks like a file that you might have forgotten the password to. Thats kind of the way were trying to structure the operating system, but its really hard! Like this is actually a very hard cryptographic problem, and its going to take a long time for us to write it.", "image": null}

So Precursor in and of itself, we actually have a software emulator for it online, if you go to our repo and you look for https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core the operating system itself is written to run in whats called Hosted Mode, so you can either do it in a full hardware emulator or you can do it with half of it based in a UI rendering running on your machine. Its really primitive  all we have is message passing going on right now inside of it. But were trying to facilitate some in that area early on. But you dont even have to use Xous, our operating system. At its core its a RISC-V CPU, and you could port it to almost any other platform that you want! And I imagine more practically speaking, the early Bitcoin people probably dont want to wait for us to implement all of these fancy plausible deniability features and all of our fancy multi-lingual method inputs. Like were putting a lot of effort in before we even get to the application level! In which case, I fully expect someone is just gonna port some RTOS to it or Linux or whatever it is and youre off to the races! Its like any other platform. The problem is that when you port one of those RTOSs to it, youre exposed to all of the vulnerabilities in those real-time operating systems! The trust level  theyre pretty good actually! I mean honestly, theyre probably okay, but were writing everything for our system in Rust, so we get better guarantees on memory safety and whatnot. A lot of RTOSs are in C, so if you have buffer overrunsgood luck! Theres these types of security properties that you have to deal with. Honestly if you want to port an RTOS, one Im very familiar with is called ChibiOS  you could probably do it in a couple, three days, if youre an experienced OS porter. And you could have enough functionality to build a Bitcoin wallet pretty simply on top of it!

The good news is that for the audio path, the entire audio path is in the trusted domain.

That being said, I did design the system so that a hacker could extend it maybe to put a camera on the inside. One of the thoughts I had is it would be nice to get QR codes if you want. Theyre convenient, theyre fast, theyre easy to use. Again, from the standpoint of just purity of the hardware, I didnt want to cross that boundary until we saw it. But the acoustic samplesits just an AD/DA converter. Its just a dumb analog to digital converter codec chip that we have, and then all the DSP happens inside the CPU. The good news is that we have  from a different, unrelated project  our team actually has a lot of experience with acoustic data modulation. For the pandemic, we were contracted to come up with some proposals for acoustic beacons for contact tracing for privacy conscious people. And so we created ultrasonic data transfer methods for getting bits of cryptographic data back and forth between two tokens at a range of one meter or so. You dont hear it, but the data can be transferred over that distance. And so we have that code base! And thats a thing that works over free space. We have to deal with all the background noise, and everything like this! If you plug it into a cable between your computer  and I would recommend doing that anyways, because why would you want to broadcast your Bitcoin transaction anyways over free space!

The collaborative aspect of hardware is still a work in progress. Theres a number of services currently trying to create like the GitHub for hardware  that type of thing. Theres a lot of challenges actually to really making hardware extremely collaborative, and a lot of it boils down to the exact same problem that we were talking about earlier of the whole, What is this individual unit in your hand mean relative to the reference design? A classic problem in hardware is that even my design files  the ones that I create  are not synchronized with what goes into the assembly machine on the factory floor! And the reason is that the manufacturer themselves will oftentimes modify it to improve the manufacturability of the design. So very simple example is if Im trying to cut a piece of metal, and I specify a square edge on it  the cutting bit is round! You cant get a perfect square corner on that cut. So the manufacturer will make a modification  either they will add an extra drill point, or theyll actually round out the corner, whatever it is  you dont get exactly what was in your CAD file. And so what happens is I actually have to go through, send it to the manufacturer, they have to go through their drill bench and then feed back to me what the standard radiuses arethis whole process, and then taking all that back. If someone wants to truly reproduce an exact copy of that design, its actually quite hard! Theres these very small subtleties! And its like, you dont have this problem in the software world, because one you compile something, thats it!", "image": null}

Like it actually comes down to literally the details of the CNC machine thats working on that metal case that impart almost a sort of texture onto the case itself. And so these are some of the unique challenges in the hardware world in terms of collaboration. So thats one sort of extreme example. So you can just imagine now, when youre at that level ofone hardware guy just patches on some blue wires on something and makes a new version! How do you capture that on the schematic? You know, those flying wires. How do you annotate that? Literal patches need to be communicated. So theres a lot of challenges there! But, in principle, and what I really do hope is that someone does take Precursor and someone in the Bitcoin community is like, Oh we really need this camera and were totally okay with the attack surface of the camera, which is completely fine  you can add it in and make your own version with a camera! I actually designed it so that its relatively trivial. Like you could almost take the base unit: 99% of the design is the same, and you just have to modify a couple components to mount a camera in there, write some software, and then you have a very different function device! So the hardware itself, Precursor itself, is modularly designed to facilitate this sort of community growth. I dont know how its gonna evolve! I cant predict what people will do, what they like, what they dont like. But oftentimes what happens is it starts with a need. Someone has an itch that they have to scratch  Im the closest thing to scratching it  and they just want to hack whatever into it, and I try to give them easier places to hack that hopefully will make it easier for the rest of the community to pull it back in. But you know? People surprise me all the time! They come up with elaborate ways that are much harder than it would be. And then its hard to share it back and then we have to talk to each other and then have a conversation and be engineers and humans and respect each other and figure out how to build a community, right? But thats the essence of community building at the end of the day!", "image": null}

I guess this conflates two aspects: one is the security aspect and one of the open source aspect. From a security standpoint, I will fully admit, Precursor takes one of the most extreme positions you can get in terms of trustability and security  we make a lot of usability sacrifices in the name of absolute trust. Thats because the threat model is so severe! We really took it to an extreme in terms of designing it. Which means that in practice, a more mass-adopted unit will have more features and have more attack surfaces, but you have to find that balance! On the other hand, if we dont move the goal posts all the way to the end of the field, well never know where it ends! So thats the idea, is to do that! So I think itll probably be at some point in the mass-adoption curve where we realize some things are really important  like we want to know about our CPU, we want to know about our key store  and other things probably arent as important like the camera or the cellular radio interfaces. We can contain those, right? Those are not actual attack surfaces, just theoretical attack surfaces. And then in terms of the trustability and reliability of the hardware, I mean the open source aspectthe ability to look at it and say whats there or not  that will be driven more byits almost a cat and mouse game! In an ideal world, obviously you justeveryone keeps their word! And then theres no demand for any of this, right? In the security world  and this is where the dirty secrets of being in the security world [are]  is that, security experts drive both the supply and the demand for their trade. So if a security expert is not having enough work defending computers, they go into the business of making exploits, which then creates demand for their  theyre actually one of the few trades that can sort of legally control supply and demand for their efforts right now, right? In a way, what the demand for this sort of open hardware stuff will depend a bit on [is] what we find out in the wild! If it turns out that in practice no one ever finds Bitcoin valuable to go ahead and do a supply chain exploit to steal $10 Million worth of Bitcoin, then there will be no demand for this type of thing! But I think once you actually get a well documented case out in the wildthis is what happened. You both get the lesson, you get not a theoretical thing, but actually a real thing and this has happened and people are like, Okay, well you gotta avoid that! This is essential! That you have to have this standard of inspectability, otherwise youre vulnerable to this! Then I think people take it more seriously. But unfortunately, human behavior is really bad at doing things that are just good for them, because  going to the gym, eating well, getting exercise  very hard for people to do! Because its sort of all this preventative maintenance type of thing. Whereas once you have a very immediate feedback that something is bad, people have a much easier time of doing something about it. So the market for open hardware and inspectability and are they gonna be exploits inside of my hardware and how important is it to open it up and this reproducability  I think its gonna depend in part upon what the adversaries do! The other potential outcome maybe is that we have  and this would be the ideal: were all holding hands and rainbows in the world  we have such a fecund and diverse innovation ecosystem around this, the modularity and everyones developing this, these open hardware designs are just desirable because were [all] so productive and so interesting, right? I wish we could get there but Im not holding my breath for that outcome. Its usually driven more by fear than by inspiration and hope.", "image": null}

Weve got all the certification ready, all the prototypes put into the pipe. Were working against the Chinese New Years deadline. We have a lot of suppliers all over the world and a lot of them are in Asia so we have to give them all these prototypes before Chinese New Years.

So a whole bunch of our constructs in measuring the existing system are wrong! Completely wrong! Because technology is moving in the base layer of everything that were doing. This video conference were on, we couldnt have done this 20 years ago!", "image": null}

I mean I see this in my own life with just podcasting, the hardware has come down in price, the software is providing everything for free that they used to pay a technician to help provide for you or something of that sort. And you point a lot of things out on the book, especially at the beginning, it set the framework and to get our heads around exponentiality. And you talk about governments printing trillions of dollars and trying to understand that 1 trillion seconds is equal to 31,709 years! Just to kind of give some perspective! And you have an anecdote about having dinner with your friend Chen Fong, and you mention having dinner with his parents and them kind of getting a little nervous about whats happening. And they mention this quip around: first currency wars, then trade wars, and then real wars!

And so again, if people could see that all of the pricing of everything around them is just an illusion out of money printing  and thats hard to see  but if my thesis [in the book] was right, that technology is driving exponentially more efficiency, then something on the other side of that ledger should prove that thesis correct! So in the beginning of the book I talked about, We have $250 Trillion of debt to run an $80 Trillion global economy. And those numbers are so staggering! But you could sayif you believed in fairy tales  you could say maybe we can grow our way out of it. If theres new industries created, then we could grow our way out of it. If it was just status quo. But taxes would have to go up to grow our way out of it. Right? Wed have to pay back the debt. And the debt is such a staggering number. But then when you realize $185 Trillion of that debt has come over the last 20 years, you see the smoking gun! So, thesis: Technology is driving this, everything is more efficientdeflation. And massive amounts of easing  exponentially more  each year are needed to try to stop that, to pretend we still live in an inflationary world! So okay, now whats the consequence? Thats looking backwards, thats to 2019. So looking forwards, if technology is still moving exponentially, you have to expect that that $185 Trillion looks like childs play looking backwards compared to whats needed looking forwards to stop that, and thats what were seeing! Now, in that game, because again  we dont measure these things at a system level  we measure them by independent variables. We look at our housing, we say, Housing always goes up! And fail to ask, would housing have gone up without $185 Trillion of liquidity? Extra liquidity, over the last 20 years? And the simple answer is, No, housing is mispriced! Massively mispriced! As everything else is! Because of that liquidity, that easing pulling forward demand. So the next question is, how long can that continue? But not just continue $100 Trillion more over many years  exponentially more? To be able to fight the other force of technological deflation! And so, it can continue! If governments can continue printingresetting their currencies  essentially devaluing their currencies forever, then it can continue! Because really what theyre doing is, theyre pouring money into a hole. But when you change the rules of what money is by making up new money, somebody loses on the other side of that bet! And theres a whole bunch of losers on the other side of that bet, including anybody on fixed wages. And so you see revolution in wars emerging as the number one threat to society, because youre manipulating this. So everything is mispriced  everything! Its not natural! But we all live in that mispriced world, and we know its going to be more mispriced going forward, and so a whole bunch of the wealthy try to put their money in assets that are going to take advantage of that mispricing. Theyre making good decisions in a world gone crazy.", "image": null}

For myself I remember in college getting my finance degree and long-term capital management was when the framework for me kind of broke. I didnt form a thesis around it and write a book, but in 20062007 I had returned home to suburbia Long Island, from San Francisco. And I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood: lots of teachers, plumbers, electricianspeople in those fields can do very well! But I would walk around and everybody had new siding and brand new $30,000 cars and you can tell that this was all financed through debt. And this was all 20062007 and then 2008 we have the great financial crisis. And recently you spoke in front of the House of Commons, and this is kind of the reason I brought this up, maybe those events and government. And also when I was in grad school we studied a lot of accounting fraud, and most of the accounting fraud examples that we studied, the fines never really amounted to anything near the gains from the fraud that usually settled in a no-fault agreement. So one side could argue they were just being aggressive. And so with that underpinning, How much fraud do you think is in Fortune 500 companies? Or the S&P 500? And when did you start to formulate this thesis around debt and the black hole?", "image": null}

Now remember, in any system change, they cannot work together! An inflationary monetary policy is incongruent with where technology is going. Technology tries to make everything cheaper, more abundant, and inflationary monetary policy does the opposite. These are forces that are competing against each other  the only way they can co-exist is with concentration of power by the state. Essentially destroying all free markets. Thats the only way they can co-exist: if people believed in a fairy tale of money and government power forever, and saying, Okay you make all the decisions for me! Then they can co-exist! That would look pretty dystopian. That would look like what Chinas trying to do with the currency control. But otherwise these things cannot co-exist! So that was the realization: the technology. When I saw that every single business that I was involved in  my first business cost me almost $5 Million to create the technology platform, that Shopify today does for $50 a month! And Shopifys platform today is like 100 times better than what I created over 2 years with $5 Million. Its the point of technology! It reduces prices and increases abundance! So Kodak going brokeits not like we use less photos today. The number of photos is staggering that we use today! And storage has collapsed in price! Everything has collapsed in price along that same axis! [19:47] We have all of that abundance! We have it in our phones! We have it in everything we do! So if its moving at that pace, why is everything going up in price? It forces you to ask kind of just a first principle question and saying, It shouldnt be! And with that you find the smoking gun. And then you realize  Oh my god!how much credit is being created out of thin air! What that means, and all of the repercussions to society  Oh my god! And theres a reset coming! It can come in a number of different forms, but there is a reset coming!", "image": null}

And Im not gonna say which one at this point because theres gonna be pieces coming out in time. But he said to me, I read your book last year and it was impossible to disagree with any of it! And I sent it to some top people in government, finance and everything  Blackstone  the works. And got back: We have to keep printing. Not, This is wrong! We have to keep printing. And what he said to me over a couple hour conversation is he said, We in media are not doing our job, because everybody is going back to the exact same people saying, How do we solve this? And the exact same people are creating the mess! Now theyre stuck  now he didnt say this, its what I said  its not bad actors, not invariably all bad people! You could change an actor in a system and it wont change the system! They are stuck in a system that cannot be solved from the existing system  its impossible! Its actually mathematically impossible to solve. Its like  and I use this example in the book  its like Blockbuster solving Netflix from their stores. Its impossible! Two totally different systems! And they cant be solved. So thats why Bitcoin is advancing so fast! And actually the best chance for a peaceful transition is Bitcoin! Thats a bold statement but I believe it to be true, because its a forcing function that is a different system. System change very rarely comes from within. And what were seeing is, name somebody right now  try to find somebody who doesnt want more easing? Whether its more printing for the Left or the Right, Im gonna make up money for these people, Im gonna make up money for these people  there is no free market anymore! Its gone! And everybody requires  and if there isnt any easing, the system would collapse, asset prices would collapse by 90%, homelessness everywhere, banking failure around the globe, and it would be a hard reset, and then it would be reformed in some new system on the other side. Thats what would happen today! [23:55] So its no wonder in that policy environment you have governments  every one of them  trying to out-print each other! Because they know that thats true! And every time, they make the system more fragile, but the question is: what would you have them do? Theres a whole bunch of population that  because they created this problem and didnt know they were creating it, trying to outrun it, grow the way theyve always grown, this tiny little bit of inflation will manipulate markets more open, and then it got more and more and more as technology was going the other way  now were way too late!

Its that  because if central banks try to do that, then each central bank is gonna control their citizens through that, and then the central banks are gonna try to make their digital currencies stronger against other currencies in trading blocs, from their digital currencies all fighting and playing that same game. Bitcoin solves that. In fact, I think Bitcoin happened faster  I think if the US goes and embraces itwhich is much higher likelihood, because if you look at the US Constitution and everything else, it was all around rights and freedoms of the individual, which created innovation, strong economy  everything else! And now its moving far away from that, but I suspect that if any country could embrace what Bitcoin stands for, its actually going to be the US, and you can see in some of the regulation, its actually moving that way! But if that happens, its kind of checkmate for Chinas digital Yuan. Its a forcing function for that as well. Its actually probably the best thing geopolitically that could happen. Im careful on some of these things because these are all probability events, and youre dealing with something that has such a magnitude on all of our lives, that its bound to not be a straight line. Theres gonna be some thrashing back and forth, different policies and everything else. When you hear things like  The Great Reset  spoken from multiple different politicians all at the same time, realize that theres a whole bunch of stuff happening behind that conversation to be able to say, Heres how were gonna talk about it. So that Great Reset is probably different governments coming together and creating a different unit of currency, unit of account, to try to bring this back together. Whats great about a reset and what youre doing and what people are doing is, emboldening more government control. Thats whats happening. Or when you hear  Build Back Better  when you hear all these things. Now if it was one institution  I am not for conspiracy theories, this is actors in a system doing their best to protect the systembut, when you hear something from multiple different places, theres coordination happening behind the scenes on this. When you think about  and Ive said this numerous times as well, and I say it because no one else is saying it!  wherever you are on the environmental climate change discussion, realize that all governments today talking about climate change because people believe its such a big deal  and it is, its a big deal  and they say, Were gonna invest in solving climate change and were gonna print more money to be able to solve climate change. Think of that oxymoron! Because you cant! The existing system cant solve climate change!", "image": null}

In terms of people in government  and its not so much a conspiracy theory  its people acting with rational incentives and trying to figure out best solutions within the framework that theyve been presented. And it is a system that maybe overarches peoples abilities to turn the boat around. But how much of it do you think is rational incentives in the system maybe now  meaning, I might be encouraged to make the pie smaller so that my slice of the pie gets bigger, versus, Lets grow the pie for everyone and for the benefit of humanity and more that optimistic view of what to do with the choices at hand?", "image": null}

And in a book like that I had to cover a lot of ground and simplify these things to make it consumable so people can put the picture together. But some of these thingsif you take game theory  really what youre saying is, Im gonna care about my family first  me first. We dont think about everyone else in every interaction. Most times we think about what we are individually. We look at our own photos, we look at our own media, we constantly reinforce me, me, me, me, me. Then its our family. Then its our friends and community. Then its nation states. And all of these things are just how people think. Not good, not bad, not anything else. Its really, really hard to go the other way and say, Im gonna think about everybody and not me! So when you think about game theory and everything else and these incentives, just go back to that and say, If you have a choice  you individually have a choiceuse Bitcoin as an example, its whats driving it too: I can go in right now and I can protect me and my family and gain a whole bunch of wealth. Itd be a rational decision. Then you think about the next level, then you think about the next level, then you think about the next level, and all of these things are just in concert: if I can buy a house now, get in now before everybody else is in and its gonna go up, you dont need more and more of these things! Or, you need some of them to live, but theyre all rational decisions individually, to be able to take more advantage.

And not that technology is one thing, and so I want to break it up into different verticals of different aspects of technology thats been coming out and been talked about for years: self-driving cars, artificial intelligence.

And actually by the way, thats a concept that a number of people mistook the book for, because recency bias  which we all have  will look at the existing events right now and discount whats happening underneath. So some people looked at the artificial intelligence chapter and everything else  by the way, there is nothing in the artificial intelligence chapter that is not true from first principles, and Im very close to it! Im very close to it! So whats happening in that realm? In some of the different research and different pieces that take deep learning to probabilistic program to other things, to eventually the singularity where computers are smarter than all humansis a thing and its a big thing! Now what people are looking for and what you just asked is, When does the light switch? And thats the thing that is so crazy  not the question, but because were in the system, we think about it as, Okay, when will everything change, and all jobs go away? And thats not the point! The point is that its actually more and more deflationary, its more and more efficient all the way along, until one day its completely free! It just keeps on getting more efficient! And so there doesnt need to be a light switch! The other thing that you asked is, When is our economy better because of that? Its not! Its continually worse, because its competing against that system! And so people are looking for more and more jobs out of this, and they dont realize that more inflation to get more and more jobs  the opposite side of the coin of inflation is wage deflation. So youre holding onto jobs by making the jobs less of a component of the overall picture by making labor cheaper. And youre tricking society into doing that so theyre working over and over and over in a job thats not required anymore, that otherwise would have gone away because technology would have removed it. But if the job went away and you forced prices this high, everybody fails! And theyre scared to death that they cant eat, they cant house themselves, everything else, because theyre measuring a system that is so overpriced, that requires prices to continually go up, and their wages are going down in that and its getting worse and worse and worse. Whereas, if you actually let nature take its course  Im not talking about the transition, the transition is difficult  if you let nature take its course, prices would fall so fast on everything! And they would keep falling, keep falling, keep falling, to free. They would just keep on going down, and you would get the abundance without the game thats being played!", "image": null}

So just have your listeners go and look at how many airplane parts are created out of additive manufacturing and youll see how fast this is moving! And as that reduces its price and increases its efficiency, additive manufacturing gets better and better and it moves into society. So it makes sense that these industries, technology moves in  it starts in industries that are high cost, reducing prices there first, creating that abundance and then scales out across the board.

And as that happens, the more new energy coming on at lower cost, and more and more and more at lower cost, you can see that the number one driver of everything else, because energy is a construct in everything we do, everything thats used is built using energy. Entire war machine is really to protect energy, because if you have a lower cost energy, your economy was better. And that structural change is happening in our lifetimes! Its happening right now! And we can see it around us. And again, people are looking to the light switch moment. The light switch moment doesnt matter at all! Its just, if you look at the trend of whats happening, its already right in front of us! It means prices should be coming down everywhere! Why are they not is because were printing money to make them go up!", "image": null}

It explores this at a way deeper level, and mathematically what has to happen to the existing system, and how that benefits Bitcoin and what a new system will look like over time. But that next step  simply ask this, Why, for the longest time, JP Morgan and all the banks, everyone was totally against Bitcoin, and now why are they for it? Because they were the number one beneficiary of printing! Because they were at the top of the stack, and they could take all of their bad loans and bad assets, put them on the feds, and get new money, to be able to create and lend to society just on an accounting trick! And so that whole stack was at the top of the pyramid, and all of the banks were the biggest beneficiaries of central bank policies over the last 30 years! They couldnt lose! Because they couldnt fail! So its a really good place, to have a one-way bet to win! And as those banks started to realize that the next stepgovernments have to consolidate control and get into the distribution businessthe last part of the quasi-free market dies. And all of those banks realized  Oh my god!  Im not needed anymore as a transfer mechanism to get this money to society! The next step is: Im gone, the next transfer mechanism is the government.", "image": null}

I honestly think that they cant! If enough got together  a lot of people listening to this wont have looked at all of this as deep as I have or maybe others have  theyll come out with the same tried and true, and theyll miss how fast this is moving! But today, how could you slow it? When I talk about The Great Reset and everything else, if you could have enough governments come together and create a new unit of value and agree on the rules that looked something like Bitcoin, that still gave them control  so that Great Reset idea, that Build Back Better idea  if enough governments got together to do that, you could slow Bitcoin. Because people might believe [that] and then slow the on-ramps to Bitcoin. I suspect in this environment  for those governments to come together to reset all of their imbalances and fiscal balances and everything else in this global trade thing  in this environment, thats an impossible task! Its an impossible task at the US level  Republicans and Democrats  let alone international governments and everything else. And why? For the same thing we talked about in game theory before: because everybodys after their own best interests! And so those types of events are typically only reset through war, not through people coming together. Theyre reset through war! So by the time governments try to figure out what that looks like, Bitcoin is gonna have broad adoption and its gonna be a forcing function! But if you asked, What could happen? That is probably something that could slow it  not stop it.", "image": null}

So today where we are in technology, its a requirement of any monetary policy that it allows for deflation. Otherwise you concentrate wealth and power. Now go to the next level: what is the most likely candidate to drive that change? The most likely candidate  [look at] already how fast Bitcoins growing  is the candidate that is a forcing function from outside the system. It is a forcing function to that change! Will there be a whole bunch of stuff in the existing system that tries to protect it? Like Blockbuster adding candy aisles to their stores? Yes! Can it solve the problem? No! So I know what bet Im gonna make! I know when I see whats happening and where Im going to place bets as a result of this  and not just from a monetary gains standpoint  in fact, probably the way at least by the way I write the book, I care about the bigger tail risk of wars and what this looks like!

You can tell by the House of Commons speech that I gave. And what I realize is, theres nothing they can do! Theres nothing that the existing system can do, and the more they try to pile money into this the worse they make it for society. Theyre blowing up a balloon that is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and the bigger the balloon, the bigger the pop on the other side. Thats what I realized. And thats unfortunate! And I wish I could put my head in the sand and say, Its not true! But it is true! And nothing that all of the people inside the system that are blaming each other and pointing fingers about change that! I expect people to blame each other! I expect that to either scream into the vortex  one side versus the othernot realizing that the thing thats in the middle of the whole thing thats creating all of the pain, and theres nothing we can do about it. I wish that wasnt true! What gives me an ability to write a book like that, and to  Ive done that all my life! Thats what an entrepreneur does! They have a viewpoint for a better future, they work like hell. And if theyre right and they can provide better value for society, and they get through the pain of what the old monopoly looks like and the market looks like  if they can get through all of that and they do this  then they win! And the only way they win is by providing value to society! So if youre that person, you almost have to hold two thoughts concurrently at the same time: (1) what the existing system looks like, and why it looks like this, and then (2) what it will do to try to protect itself as you move to a new system, as you try to accrue benefits to whoever can accrue benefits to the new system. But those two different things  because theyre so different  are really hard for people to control in their minds! They go into the one system and essentially theyre so scared of the transition or anything else that they cant actually look at logic! So they go back to, Well I need more money! The government should print more money and give it to me!", "image": null}

You ask a few questions towards the end of the book that I ask myself every day. You framed them up really well though! And some of the reasons Ive maybe even challenged you on some of these notions is because, How many of our own beliefs stand up to the facts? To future generations, How many of our current actions fueled by those beliefs will look outright foolish? How do we overcome our errors, bias, and narratives that make up our operating system? And I ask these kinds of questions because I have so much conviction, and I believe you do too! And I still want to challenge our convictions! And that made me think a lot about how with just technology, how much information we deal with every day, how the worlds information is doubling at an incredible rate! How do you decide or choose what information to consume, and maybe even in what form? Because time management is an issue! Time is scarce! Youre not gonna know everything in the world, therefore maybe even were wrong about some of the things were [convinced] on  Im not getting at Bitcoin here  maybe on other things in our lives.

And by doing that, if you put yourself first with humility and say, I make these mistakes too  we all do. You can notice even on Twitter, a lot of times I dont say, You, You, You. I say, We, and, Me. I also make them. And then what do I do to avoid those mistakes? And you just hit on a really interesting thread that I think about: every abundance creates scarcity. So, (1) today we have an abundance of information and misinformation. And (2) on that, we are likely to click on things that we like or agree with and hang out with people that we like and agree with, because they reinforce  because its easier. It reinforces our belief system! So Im bombarded with information, and we dont like to look at information that doesnt match our narrative. Me too! We all do! Its a natural fact! And so, how do I  if thats the truth, and Im just as likely as everybody else to do that  make sure that I spend my time, my most valuable asset, in things that dont get sucked into that vortex? And its hard! You have to force yourself to look at other points of view with a really open mind! To be able to debate somebody elses point of view, like you know it better than them! And then come back to yours and look at something from all sides to realize that. And you cant do that on every single item, you just dont have the time to do it on every single item! So where are the things that are deeper? First principles that are  and money and power are pretty big! So what are the ones that are core to a whole bunch of other decisions that I might get wrong too? Go deeper on those ones, and then just keep asking why? Is it a belief or is it a fact? And thats really important today, because theres a whole bunch of people  you see it on Twitter all the time  that are shouting because of a belief! And a belief that is completely wrong, that doesnt have any facts! So is it a belief or a fact? And just keep on asking, Why do I believe that? Is that true? Is it for sure true? Or is it a belief? I understand because its hard for anybody to do that, and the more information and the more information siloswith both of those two things  make it even harder!", "image": null}

So for our purposes: Bitcoin exchanges, custodians, and payment processors, to KYC or to collect due diligence information about their customers, like names, addresses, social security numbers, other information  to record that information and then also to report it to the governments, depending on what jurisdiction youre in. Here in the US, we focus most on the Bank Secrecy Act, which is the federal law that requires a variety of crypto companies including money transmitters to comply with those anti-money laundering obligations. [04:44] Whats happening now  and I think the reason this was the right time for us to get together  is, the financial crimes enforcement network, or FinCEN, which is a bureau of the US Treasury department, has proposed a new rule that would expand the anti-money laundering obligations of those crypto companies beyond where theyve ever been before. Up until now the majority of the anti-money laundering obligations only applied to transactions of Bitcoin between crypto companies, as in, youre sending Bitcoin from one exchange to another exchange, or from one exchange to a custodian or some other regulated company. What FinCEN is proposing, essentially, is to expand those record-keeping and reporting obligations to transactions between institutions and wallets. Meaning, the company would have to do some KYC for transactions that a customer like you or me would try to either withdraw Bitcoin from the exchange to our own wallet, or deposit Bitcoin into the exchange from our wallet. So thats whats happening here right now in the US!", "image": null}

Basically every government agency comes up with its own acronyms to describe the types of things that we all talk about very differently in the industry. CVC stands for Convertible Virtual Currency. Its basically just FinCENs word for any cryptocurrency or digital asset. Just as an example, the SEC  the Securities and Exchange Commission  uses the term digital asset to describe the same thing. So its just a peculiar term for cryptocurrencies or digital assets in general. LTDA is actually a new one that I havent seen before until just now! It stands for Legal Tender Digital Asset, which I think we would think of as a CBDC  a Central Bank Digital Currency  meaning, a cryptocurrency that is officially issued by a government, and represents not just a stablecoin that reflects the value of a fiat currency, but actually is recognized as an offical fiat currency.", "image": null}

As I mentioned, the government sort of adopts terms that fit their narrative. I think virtual currency is actually one of them! Something thats virtual sounds lesser than something that is real. And similarly, the government has adopted the terms hosted wallet and unhosted wallet to describe what we would think of as simply an account at a third-party custodian, or, your own wallet. And I think the reason that theyve done that in large part is, something that is hosted  a hosted wallet  sort of sounds safe! Right? Its hosted, theres someone in charge, its all neat and tidy. Whereas something that is unhosted sounds dangerous. Theres no one hosting it, who knows whats going on, its kind of wild and out of control! And I do think thats the signal that some folks are trying to send by using the terms hosted and unhosted. [08:58] Theres a third term that you mentioned which is self-hosted. I think that one has been a little bit confused among folks on Bitcoin Twitter. Self-hosted is not a term the government has been pushing. It was actually the industrys response to the term unhosted, in an attempt to say, These wallets are not some scary, wild, uncontrolled, unhosted thing. These wallets belong to real people who are exercising their rights of self-sovereignty in control of their own property, by hosting their own wallets for themselves! And I think that wasnt received totally well because I think you and I would agree, we should really just call these accounts hosted at a third-party, or wallets, because a wallet is the default. But thats sort of the genesis of that term.", "image": null}

Under current law, regulated institutions have to comply with something called the travel rule, which you probably hear about a lot. And what the travel rule basically says is, when a regulated institution sends Bitcoin or some other digital asset to another regulated exchange, along with the asset must travel information about the parties who are making the transaction. So if an institution is sending Bitcoin to some other institution, they have to include information about the customer who has sent that transaction. The travel rule essentially applies internationally. So it is a US law, but the same travel rule has essentially been implemented in every major jurisdiction with the exception of some places that you think of as offshore banking havens that the westernized world is trying to bring into compliance. But the travel rule has never applied to transactions outside the world of those regulated financial institutions! Anti-money laundering compliance obligations in general do not apply to individuals who are transacting on their own behalf. It only applies when there is a third-party intermediary thats transferring funds on behalf of customers or on behalf of other people. The proposal that FinCEN has put forward now is similar to what has come to be known as the Swiss rule. This is a sort of different implementation of the travel rule that Switzerland came out with earlier this year, which says that exchanges  or other regulated institutions  also have to collect information about transactions with wallets. Not just transactions with other institutions. The Swiss rule says that in order to process a transaction between institution and wallet, the institution must verify the beneficial owner of the wallet. Meaning, to figure out basically who owns the private key so you can figure out who is the person receiving these funds. And the proposal from FinCEN is very similar. It doesnt use the word verify, but what it says is: the regulated institution must obtain and retain the name and physical address of the counterparty of a transaction. Meaning, if youre, lets just say Kraken for example  youre a Kraken customer  and you want to withdraw Bitcoin to your own wallet, you would have to provide your name and physical address associated with the public key that you are withdrawing Bitcoin to. And similarly, if you wanted to withdraw Bitcoin from Kraken to someone elses wallet, you would have to give Kraken the name and physical address of that person even though they are not affiliated in any way with Kraken, or with whatever institution youre using! [13:54] So its an expansion of anti-money laundering obligations in a way that will jeopardize the privacy of more people who are using Bitcoin.", "image": null}

The problem with these requirements is it doesnt make a whole lot of sense to prove who the owner is of a string of letters and numbers. Right? How do you prove the owner of a private key? And so what ends up happening is, these regulated institutions get very confused about how they can comply with these regulations. But they have to comply one way or another or they could be at risk of being penalized for violating the regulation. So one way to mitigate the risk of a violation is for an institution to say, Look, were just not gonna allow withdrawals or deposits involving some other third party who isnt one of our customers, someone we dont have a business relationship with, someone who hasnt signed our Terms & Conditions, potentially waiving liability or other rights and litigation, so were only going to allow these transactions with our customer. That would obviously be a significant limitation! I think that the biggest fear though, is that these institutions would say, Even for our customers, we fundamentally do not understand how we can verify the owner of a private key, because anyone else in the world could have the same string of letters and numbers and therefore have access to the Bitcoin associated with that private key! So were just not gonna allow withdrawals and deposits at all! Were gonna essentially mandate custody and cut off transactions with peoples wallets. That would be an extreme result, but I do think we need to be at least cautious about the possibility that thats where this is heading.", "image": null}

And then what would happen to the Bitcoin network at that point? All the Bitcoin that is sort of outside of that walled garden  it would just be a very weird situation! Probably an interesting example you might have seen is in the Netherlands, there was an example of an exchange called Bitonic, and they were asking for basically a wallet screenshot. Now, that doesnt necessarily verify that this person  well first of all, they could have just shown a screenshot from someone elses wallet! Whats your take on that aspect? Could that be a way that some Bitcoin businesses try to comply with this rule, even if its not technically bulletproof there?", "image": null}

I think this gets back to theories of regulation. Lets assume for a second that we think that regulation is appropriate in the first place  which I think maybe you and some of the audience might not agree with! Lets just accept that premise for a minute! What you want in good regulation is clarity about how the target of the regulation can comply. Generally speaking, businesses are not that afraid of regulation as long as they know how to comply, as long as theyre not worried that somethings gonna go wrong, and theyre gonna get tied up in some lengthy investigation or enforcement action thats going to result in significant penalties. So you want your regulators to be clear about how companies can comply! I think in this instance, it is very unclear, including in the case of the Netherlands, how a regulated institution can verify the owner of a private key, as you said  a screenshot could be from anywhere! Also, I could sign a message using a private key  that doesnt mean Im the only one that has that private key! So I think that there are a lot of open questions about how someone can comply with this rule. The hope is that regulators are providing some clarity to say, Look if you do it this way, if you take a screenshot, were not gonna come after you! But again in terms of good regulation, that should be made clear to the public, not just to companies behind closed doors!

If they were to say, in FinCENs example specifically, It is enough for the customer who is processing the withdrawal  receiving the deposit  to simply say the name and physical address of the counterparty to the transaction, and no further diligence is required. I suppose the compliance cost is fairly low, but the compliance cost is only one factor to consider. There are others. In terms of a chilling effect I think first of all this is a pretty significant infringement of privacy rights! I think that its very different from regulations that have applied in traditional finance  the very specific targeting toward Bitcoin  in the sense that, when you withdraw paper cash from a bank, you do not need to prove anything about where the cash is going when you withdraw it. And similarly if you deposit cash at the bank, you do not need to prove where the cash is coming from. And to have this additional burden on the individual to hand over more information about the people that theyre conducting financial transactions with is a significant infringement of their privacy rights  very different from what weve seen before! [20:33] And you can imagine that customers who dont want to sacrifice their privacy rights would simply leave the jurisdiction! They would start patronizing companies in other jurisdictions! Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, and so I think that theres a chilling effect in that sense. I also think it may just discourage people from taking custody of their own assets. They may not want to deal with these compliance burdens and they may decide, You know what? Im just gonna leave these assets in custody because I dont want to deal with it! And I think all of that is really harmful to Bitcoin! And certainly not worth the alleged benefits that these regulations would provide [to the] government.", "image": null}

And so it pushes people in certain ways because now those non-US companies are often just saying, We dont want you if youre a US customer! Because we dont want to deal with that compliance burden! But in a small way like you were saying, maybe US customers will then go and be customers in some other Bitcoin business overseas so that they dont have to deal with as much of the compliance and that aspect of it!", "image": null}

You make a great point. The more likely outcome is not so much that US citizens start using businesses abroad, but rather that US companies leave, and decide not to serve as US citizens. And as you point out, the US government tends to think that it has unlimited extra territorial jurisdiction, that its laws apply all over the world no matter where you are or who you are. And FATCA is the perfect example of how the US used its  basically the way that its ability to tax companies and to exclude them from the US economy  to force them to comply with US law even though they were outside the US. We see the same thing with someone like BitMEX, where BitMEX was not based in the US, and was at least making some attempt  although debatable how effective it was  to exclude US citizens from its platform, but because there were a couple of US citizens on the platform, the US governments view was, theyre a strict liability for compliance with US law! If you service one US citizen, then you must comply with the full panoply of US laws! And so it is very hard to escape US jurisdiction and I do perceive this as another attempt by US government to reassert its authority globally over the operation of the financial system as a whole. US foreign policy is administered through the countrys control of the financial system, and Bitcoin is essentially an existential threat to that control. Or at least it could be perceived that way  Im not sure it really is! But I think thats why were seeing this rising concern over a peer-to-peer financial system that does not require the operation of intermediaries that the government can easily regulate.", "image": null}

But there are some jurisdictions where there are some companies that simply refuse to comply! Especially in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran or North Korea or Venezuela or Myanmar  places like that. And the requirement of the foreign jurisdictions list basically says: Were also going to extend anti-money laundering compliance obligations for record-keeping and recording. Not just the transactions between institutions and wallets, but also between institutions that are compliant with the Bank Secrecy Act, and institutions in jurisdictions that do not comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. So when an exchange, for example, sends lets say $15,000 worth of Bitcoin to another regulated exchange that is compliant with the travel rule, the sending exchange does not need to report anything to the government, because the travel rule has been followed. What this new rule would say is: if the institution cant be sure that the other institution is compliant, then they do need to submit one of those reports to the government. So this is really another way for US government to get more control over institutions in those places that are refusing to play along with the rules that government is setting.", "image": null}

So theres a difference between an exchange being forced under a subpoena for example, to turn over information to government, versus the exchange having an affirmative obligation to automatically report that information to government. And I think thats one of the big differences here. Under current law, an exchange certainly already has all of this information about withdrawals to folks wallets. But they arent automatically turning that information over to the government in the form of a currency transaction report. And in fact, many of the exchanges will even publish information about what kinds of requests theyre getting from government: how many subpoenas theyre getting, how many of them theyre challenging, how many of them theyre actually having to comply with to turn over customer information. This new rule would greatly limit the ability of these exchanges and other companies to protect the privacy of their customers. And thats a really big concern, not only because in general we should respect consumer privacy and the privacy of people who are transacting in Bitcoin, but also because government just hasnt shown that they are either using that information effectively  and we could have a really interesting debate about whether the anti-money laundering system we have, which depends on financial surveillance, is even working, if its even helping law enforcement to detect and prosecute crime  but also, government hasnt shown that they are able to safeguard that information. I mean just recently there was a report of a massive hack of the US treasury department specifically, in which an extraordinary amount of sensitive information was lost to hackers. And as we record this we still dont really have a good sense of what information was compromised and for how long!

Its very much like the Ledger hack. If youre loading up a hardware wallet with a lot of value in Bitcoin, you probably dont want people to know what your home address is! Its very sensitive information! (2) What government would say about this concern that these jackpots of sensitive information are being exposed by hackers  what they would say is: thats a cybersecurity problem. The problem is that companies are not doing a good enough job of protecting customer data. So we need to pass even more regulation, right? The GDPR for example  to require companies to do a better job of maintaining their customers privacy. And I think the other side of that policy debate is the one that I would take and probably the one most Bitcoiners would take, which is: this data cannot be protected! There is no perfect cybersecurity system that is going to prevent these jackpots from being compromised! The solution is to simply not create the jackpots in the first place, and given that collecting all this information is yielding very little benefit to government in the first place, maybe we would be better served by simply not collecting it at all!", "image": null}

Theyve maybe a month of time left, and theyre trying to jam through some rule as fast as possible without following the regular order for considering whether the policy that theyre trying to put into place is even good to begin with! Typically this occurs in the US in the transition period between presidencies. So we had a presidential election at the beginning of November. Donald Trump lost the election to Joe Biden. President-elect Biden will take office on January 20th. And at that point the treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is out of a job. And really, this new regulation is something that Steve Mnuchin uniquely wants to pass! This is really not something that the entire treasury department is behind. Its really something that secretary Mnuchin believes personally is important. And its something he wants to accomplish before he leaves office. So what hes done basically is to violate the regular order for considering a proposed rule like this. In the United States theres a federal law called the Administrative Procedures Act, the APA, which sets up the requirements for administrative rule making. And what it says basically is: an agency  before they can put a new rule into place  has to give the public notice of what the proposed rule is, and has to give the public an opportunity to comment on whether the rule is good or not! Whether it could be improved, whether its flawed, what the cost-benefit is of the new rule. This is called notice and comment rule making. And for a significant rule  one thats gonna have a really big impact on industry or in society at large  an agency is supposed to give at least 60 days for the public to give comments. And then usually theres a long process after that where theres discussion and the back and forth between the industry and the agency, about whether the rule is good or not! And in this circumstance, because Secretary Mnuchin doesnt have 60 days  he has only 30 at the time were recording this, before hes out of officehe decided that for this rule there should only be 15 days for the public to comment! And not just 15 days, but 15 days at the end of December leading into early January over Christmas and New Years when most people are trying to take a vacation! So the fear is that this is not a genuine process where Secretary Mnuchin is really soliciting input from the public that he will consider before deciding what he wants to do. But rather, that he already knows what he wants to do, and hes just sort of trying vaguely to go through the steps required to defend the rule from a legal challenge. But really this is a done deal and probably truly at midnight  the day before he is out of office  hell decide to make this rule effective!", "image": null}

Some in the short term and some in the longer term. Right now we are confronted with this 30-day sprint where this rule may become effective before January 20th. And as the saying goes, laws are written in ink. Theyre very hard to erase! So what we really want to do is stop this rule from becoming effective before January 20th. Once there is new leadership in charge of the treasury department, we strongly believe that we will be able to convince leadership at FinCEN not to make this rule effective. And when I say we what I mean is the group of policy folks in Washington D.C. who work on these issues. So that means CoinCenter, which does phenomenal work, the Blockchain Association which is the group that I do most of my work through, the Chamber of Digital Commerce  all of these policy organizations are working very hard to stop this rule from going into effect. The way that folks can help us achieve that goal is first by submitting public comments. Ill be sure to provide more information about how to do that over the next couple weeks. We dont have a whole lot of time, but whatever we can do to convey the message that the process behind this rule and the substance of this rule are both unacceptable, the better chance we have of convincing Secretary Mnuchin that he should not take this last shot at Bitcoin on his way out the door. I also think that in terms of what we can do through the Blockchain Association and otherwise is, we can consider a legal challenge to this rule if it does go into effect. And that is something we are exploring now. Weve hired one of the best lawyers in the country, Paul Clement, who was the US Solicitor General under President George W. Bush, one of the most respected lawyers in the country, to help evaluate grounds to challenge this rule under the PA. And if it comes to it  I think that is likely what we will do  we will file a lawsuit and we will try to get a judge to stop enforcement of the rule hopefully long enough that we can have a change of administration and then FinCEN will have some cover to walk away from this rule. So thats all in the short term. I also just want to say, in the long term, I think we need to understand that this is just the beginning! Secretary Mnuchin is particularly hostile to Bitcoin, but that doesnt mean that once hes gone, everything is gonna be fantastic and great and wonderful! There are a lot of other policy makers in the US and globally for example within the Financial Action Task Force, the FATF, that believe in regulation like this! So what we really need to do long term is get a lot better at boiling down our arguments of why Bitcoin is so important. Why the benefits of allowing peer-to-peer transactions, of allowing self-sovereignty, why they outweigh the supposed costs to law enforcement. And furthermore why this phenomenon cant be stopped in the first place! All a country can really do is push this activity into other jurisdictions. They cant really stop it. So the better we are at making those arguments long term, the better were gonna be at defeating this final boss that is trying to over-regulate Bitcoin.", "image": null}

That is, Bitcoin that people actually hold themselves and are able to use and send in peer-to-peer transactions and custody themselves. And then no bridge between those two worlds. Every bank and every exchange would be prohibited from allowing deposits or withdrawals to peoples wallets. I think that that is an alarmist view and I dont want to scare anyone too much, because there are a lot of people that will say that Im being paranoid and thats not really where were going. But I fear, if you listen closely to policy makers, that what you hear from them is, theyre okay with Bitcoin, as long as it looks likes digital gold in the same way as gold has been centralized in depositories that can be censored. As long as it doesnt pose a threat to monetary sovereignty, as long as it doesnt pose any other risks of terrorist financing or money laundering or other illicit activity. And that to me would be the worst case scenario, a total prohibition on transactions with non-custodial wallets. Im optimistic that we will not get there, I think that we have very strong arguments why that is a categorically worse world, and also why it is not an achievable world. But I do think thats sort of the final boss that we have to fight here.", "image": null}

So the FATF is an international standard setting body comprised of about 40 or so member jurisdictions. So you know the United States and Australia and Germany and all these other countries are members of and send representatives to the FATF. The FATF doesnt make any law, but what it does do is it makes recommendations for global industry standards. That it then sort of expects all of its members to adopt. And it does reviews on a regular basis of whether its various members have sufficiently complied with those rules. And the only teeth that the FATF has is they maintain a blacklist that basically says, If theres a jurisdiction that is really out of compliance, then no other jurisdiction should be allowed to transact with that jurisdiction. Its very much like US sanctions, and theres a lot of crossover between US sanctions and the FATF blacklist. The interesting thing is, the FATF bounces back and forth between setting its own standards that the member jurisdictions follow, versus following the lead of one or more of the member jurisdictions. Sort of like a pendulum in that sense. So sometimes the US, for example, will decide, Heres what we think the industry standard should be. And then they get the FATF to adopt whatever that is as its recommendation for the world. And sometimes vice versa, the FATF will actually generate some new recommendation that will bring member jurisdictions into compliance. Right now, what were trying to figure out is, is the FATF going to recommend this Swiss rule or something like this new FinCEN proposed rule, that imposes AML obligations on transactions between institutions and wallets, or not! And so far they actually havent. So Switzerland and the Netherlands which you mentioned, and the United States, are actually out ahead of what the FATF most recently recommended. So in June of this year the FATF did its 12-month review of its crypto guidance. And what it said basically was, We considered whether any restrictions on peer-to-peer transactions were necessary and thus far we decided theres insufficient evidence to warrant such new restrictions. But, some of our members expressed concern about this, and we will revisit this as we go forward. So one of the next big turning points that were looking to in the coming year is the FATFs next 12-month review, which should be around June 2021. If they adopt this new Swiss rule or new FinCEN proposal as the global industry standard, then you could imagine seeing what is happened so far in only a couple of jurisdictions very quickly being rolled out to dozens of more jurisdictions and becoming the global standard. So I think we need to work very hard to convince policy makers at the FATF that that is not a good idea! But thats only something to watch.", "image": null}

Yes that there is a lot that people can do on the local level, and its always important to point out that politics is local! And ultimately although many of our democratic are not functioning very well these days, our governments are at least supposed to answer to us the people. And to the extent that we can support and elect policy  elected officials specifically  who do not think that these requirements are necessary, and who will push back on them if other members of the government are trying to advance them, the better off were gonna be! So here in the US as an example, there are members of Congress who fundamentally oppose this new proposal from FinCEN. In fact, four members of Congress sent a letter to FinCEN led by Warren Davidson, a member of the House of Representatives, advising Secretary Mnuchin that this was a bad idea! And the more of that kind of support we can generate just from a grassroots level by supporting politicians and officials who believe in the principles that we believe in  the principles that support Bitcoin  the more success that were going to have. The reason I say also Yes but also No, is because in general the FATF is comprised of representatives who are not elected  they are appointed. And Secretary Mnuchin himself is not elected himself, he was appointed. So no one in the United States cast a single vote for this one individual who has more impact on financial regulatory policy than anybody else. And so its very difficult to rein in the expansion of the administrative state. So its really hard to get directly to the FATF, but much easier for us to focus on who are we voting for, and what do they believe? And will they make sure that the appointed officials  who are part of the administrative state  will they make sure that those folks are not doing things that compromise our privacy and our self-sovereignty?", "image": null}

I think that theres room for us to do both! Look, I share a lot of the more cypher-punk values and libertarian values that you do  Im a huge fan of yours! Im listening with great interest to a lot of your discussion about libertarian ideals and Austrian economics. At the same time, I live in Washington D.C., Im very active in the policy community here, and I think theres room for both of us! To do our separate work. I think that you cant deny that government has influence over the rise of Bitcoin. And basically we can do this the easy way or the hard way. And I think we would all rather do this the easy way than the hard way! I totally appreciate that there is no way that the government could ban Bitcoin. At the same time I would rather not go back to a world where we have to meet up with people in back alleys in order to buy Bitcoin that we can actually custody for ourselves. And that requires us to be engaged in the policy process. Its not for everyone, and there are some people who just dont want to get involved in a place like Washington D.C. or any of the other political capitols of the world. Thats fine! Thats sort of how I view my purpose for being here  I will take that hit! And I will do the work of the swamp! Ideally what this leads to is more time for the industry as a whole to professionalize, to mature, to build more products and services that people can use to protect their own sovereignty and to protect their own privacy. So that if someday we do lose this battle from a policy perspective and government just decides, We cannot get our minds around Bitcoin, were just not going to allow this to happen  at least weve gone as far down the road as we can before we have that adverse result! At the same time I think that there is great opportunity for Bitcoin to rise in a cooperative way, in a symbiotic way, in a way that does not result in infringement of our rights, and I would at least like to hold out hope that we can make that happen!", "image": null}

Honestly theres too many to list or even to keep track of! But Ill give you at least a couple of ideas and I think we can work on continuing to build this out as time goes on. One is about financial inclusion. I think that thats an idea that everyone can get behind. That most people in the world as a whole do not have access to reliable financial services. Were talking about people who live in places where the banks themselves are the criminal enterprise, and there is no way to conduct commerce because there is no way to transact with other people in a safe way at a distance. And I think that Bitcoin is the greatest force for financial inclusion that we can imagine! I think one person to listen to very carefully on that issue for example is Alex Gladstein at the Human Rights Foundation, because he does such a phenomenal job of highlighting cases where people are using Bitcoin not as a speculative investment  which is what I think a lot of policy makers in the developed world think that it is  but truly as a tool for commerce, and a tool to help them live better lives! I also think that there are arguments we can make about the ills of the financial system as it has come up around these very large, very powerful institutions that do not have our best interests at heart. And were seeing this now with the rise of major tech companies that have started to dominate the Internet in the same way that the mega-banks have dominated finance. And really, what we dont want to see is  with all due respect to Facebook  we dont want to see the Facebooks of the world take over finance the way that theyve taken over the Internet. And Bitcoin is the response to that! Its public payments infrastructure, as opposed to a proprietary platform run by a company that is serving its own bottom-line at the expense of its customers instead of on behalf of its customers. Those are just two ideas that I think are particularly persuasive. But I think one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is there is an argument that will persuade anyone if you could just figure out what principles matter to them and how Bitcoin addresses those principles! Maybe its too much of a meme at this point, but Bitcoin fixes this! I know there is always some kind of argument that we can make to persuade folks to get onboard, and Im confident that the more we focus on sharpening those arguments, the more impactful they will be!", "image": null}

And I guess in this instance, although many of us are libertarian as we dont necessarily want big government, we want small or zero government, but in terms of meeting the other person where they are at  in some cases if you have to make an argument to somebody who is in that sort of position  perhaps an argument might be, Well, if you want your economy to be thriving, youve got to care about jobs and businesses! And if you create this regulation and this legislation that is too burdensome, you will create a chilling effect where people may not start businesses or they may be hampered versus international competition in terms of being able to compete!

And right, it might not strike everyone as the best idea  depending on your view of government in the first place  but just as an example, Pierre Rochard put out a really interesting idea recently, which is that the US government should stop selling Bitcoin! It should start building a Bitcoin reserve! And look, thats a pretty compelling argument! And whether you want the US government to own a lot of Bitcoin or not is sort of besides the point! If you can get government to buy into the asset, then Bitcoin will sort of take care of itself on the other end, right? Bitcoin is in many ways unstoppable! So the more adoption there is, and the more approval there is, I think the more likely it is that we will end up seeing the kind of world that we think Bitcoin will usher in. There are other arguments that we have to think really hard about whether we want to make or not. One of the arguments is, really for the defense community. Which is, Bitcoin is a very effective tool of geopolitical monetary war. If you want to undermine an authoritarian or dictatorial opponent, well sanctions are fine  its what weve tried to do  but really theyre not fine. Im just articulating the way you might describe this to a policy maker! Better than using sanctions and cutting a country off from the financial system, is to undermine their own currency, and the more you can promote use of Bitcoin in that society, the less powerful the dictator or authoritarian will be! Now whether we want our governments using Bitcoin as a weapon of geopolitical war we should think very carefully about. But this is just to the point that there is always an argument about how Bitcoin can be used as a tool to accomplish an objective! And I think it behooves us to figure out what those arguments are to promote the likelihood that Bitcoin will rise peacefully, at least to the extent that it can.", "image": null}

What it means is you use it for as much good as you can, and you try to limit  perhaps  its use by bad actors to the extent that you can. But this is the story of every technology throughout human history! The first use of an automobile was for a bank robber to get away from the police faster, right? Like this is always what happens! The bad guys use technology first  it doesnt mean we throw it away! And I do think that if you can get to that level of nuance and admit that, Yes, just like the Internet, Bitcoin is open for use by anyone.

And thats why I give those two examples as maybe the best arguments for Bitcoin as a tool of self-sovereignty, not just as digital gold that you can hold in a depository. That is, the ability to use it in jurisdictions where there is no financial infrastructure that is reliable using intermediaries  and that is the majority of the world! There is no reliable bank in most places where people can just hold it in custody! And the risks that centralizing all of this  not just information but value  in institutions that can be hacked, that cannot safeguard those assets. Think of Mt. Gox as an example! Every couple months we see a big exchange hack! Those are reasons why Bitcoin is much much better as a tool of self-sovereignty, as something people can hold and safeguard on their own and use on their own without relying on intermediaries, than it is as just something you can throw a few dollars in, the same way you might buy the S&P500 Index.", "image": null}

And it would also help you track your payments, things like that. That part of BTCPay is a huge project! The Python library is just a little tiny, teeny piece of it. Not a ton of code involved in it. It just helps you, like I said, interact with BTCPay server if youve got a Python-based application that youre running. Pythons a programming language.", "image": null}

So I didnt design the library, I picked up maintaining it and added a few things to it, because it didnt have a current maintainer at the time. So I went to school a very long time ago for computer science, actually before Python was even a language that was really in use. So I had some level of background in it from undergrad, but I never had a job as a software engineer or anything like that. I didnt end up even finishing the computer science program at school. But, when I got more into Bitcoin one of the first things I did a couple years ago is I took Justin Moons bootcamp that he was giving at that time which was taught in Python. It was a Bitcoin-related Python coding bootcamp called BUIDL Bootcamp. I took it and one of the the things I started playing around with once I got back into coding was BTCPay  which is not a Python-based project in generalits written in C#. But I actually just looked to see if there was any way that I could help or contribute, and one of the things I did was I ended up taking over maintaining that library, because I built a Python-based plug-in for it that helped it communicate with QuickBooks. So I was making use of the Python library, and then at that point Nicholas asked me if Id be interested in taking over the maintaining the Python library. So I did! Its a small project, doesnt require a big brain to do it, which made it perfect for me! So thats how I got involved in it!", "image": null}

So I went to night school. I worked full-time undergrad and law school. So I didnt really take school all that seriously, particularly undergrad. I was just working. Back in those days you could still make a pretty good living without a college degree, so I did I worked as a salesman. I did the computer science thing  I excelled at it, but I was like, Well, I can keep doing this computer science major while Im working, and it actually requires a decent amount of work, and theres no girls in computer science classes. Or, like I speak Spanish pretty well, so I could just major in Spanish instead, and those classes are essentially all female, and the classes arent that difficult! So I was like, Oh! This is like a no-brainer decision! Ill just finish my degree in Spanish, so I did! Thats why I got my undergraduate degree in Spanish. Then when I graduated I was like, Well, at this point I knew I didnt want to be a salesman forever, but I didnt really know what else I wanted to do. I dont know if any of you guys have done commissioned sales before, but it really grinds on you after a while! Youre dealing with the public all day in kind of a high pressure situation. Youre spending your entire day all day making people buy stuff. Persuading people to buy stuff. I didnt want to do that, so I just started looking for a profession where I thought Id be pretty well set. Something that required licensure so that I didnt earn a decent living that anybody could just get involved in it. And I bounced around a few different ideas. I was always kind of technical minded, so I thought maybe getting involved on the tax side might work out for me in that way, and in my little town there just happened to be a guy that happened to be both an attorney and a CPA, and I realized that that made you more unique in the marketplace, it allowed you to do more interesting stuff if you had both as opposed to just being a CPA or something like that. So I went to law school, which I also did at night. Now keep in mind at this point Id never taken an accounting class before  I had still never taken an accounting class in college. I had a bachelors degree in Spanish and that was about it! So what I did was I went to  well the first thing I did was I taught myself accounting from a CPA exam prep book, and then I took the CPA exam and passed it. So at that point you still cant be a CPA though, because to be a CPA at least at that time in my state, you had to have a bachelors degree, you had to have at least 150 credits, which I didnt have because you need 120 for a bachelors degree which I didnt have yet. At least 30 of your credits had to be in accounting, and you had to work under the supervision of a CPA for at least a year like a full-time job. So what I did was  CPA exam into obtaining a full-time job at a small accounting firm where I didnt get paid very much but they were great to take me on and teach me. I dont think they even realized that my degree wasnt in accounting, because on my resume I just put that I had a bachelors degree and I passed the CPA exam  and passing the CPA exam is kind of all that matters. So I got that job and I worked there while I went to law school at night. They were flexible and allowed me to not have to work crazy hours or anything like that so I could commute to law school at night. So I did that for a year and I had the experience requirement and now I had the 150 credits because my law school credits counted, they were still credits. But I didnt have the 30 credits in accounting. In New Jersey we have a university called Thomas Edison state college that will give you credit for your life experience, so I went to Thomas Edison state college and said, Hey, I had passed all four parts of this CPA exam on my first try, and Ive been working in public accounting for a year  will you guys give me 30 accounting credits based on that experience? And they said yes! Predominantly based on the strength of having passed the CPA exam. So I had to pay for those credits, of course, but I didnt have to actually take classes or tests for them. I had to provide proof of everything, proof that I passed the CPA exam, proof that Id been working in public accounting for a year, and they gave me 30 credits for accounting on a pass/fail basis, but they were still college credits. And they werent from the institution where I had my bachelors degree but that didnt matter. At that point I had all of the requirements I needed to pass my states licensing requirements, so I did! Around that same time, I also finished law school and took the bar exam and passed that. Bar exam much, much easier than the CPA exam  not even close! CPA exam, much much much harder! At least in my state. Yeah CPA is really four different exams. You take it in four parts, it has some much bigger breadth of knowledge. Bar exam is two days. You just sit down, two days, youre down with it. At that point, I was licensed in both! I knew that I wanted to do my own thing, so I opened up my own firm right away as soon as both of my licensures were finalized. In the beginning, Bitcoin didnt exist back then, so I didnt have any focus obviously at all with regard to Bitcoin. I just had a tax firm. I did tax returns, I did tax planning work, I did a lot of estate planning work back then too. In those days the estate tax threshold was only a million dollars, so a lot of people were paying federal state tax so they needed fancier estate plans because they needed to be really tax-driven. Thats not really the case anymore, estate planning is not really as tax-driven because for a married couple today, the federal state tax threshold is almost $23 million dollars. So the type of work that I used to do pretty much disappeared over the years! It just wasnt a thing that people needed anymore, for regulatory reasons. Around that same time I started to get involved with Bitcoin! Bought Bitcoin myself and I was like, Well, wouldnt it be really cool if I could buy Bitcoin for myself in a tax-advantaged way through a retirement account. So I came up with the structure  now I refer to it as The KeyKeeper IRA structure  then, it didnt even have a name. For myself, predominantly! I was like, well this is for me! And I offered it to clients as a thing around that time but nobody cared. Most people had never heard of Bitcoin, the people that had heard of Bitcoin were like, if you talked to them about taxes they thought you were a Fed. Funny story about that, I wrote an article for CoinDesk a million years ago back when it was  CoinDesk didnt even have professional journalists back then, they would accept open submissions. And it was about tax consequences of Bitcoin. Real, real basic stuff. This was back when you could just have open comments under articles. All the comments were like, Dont listen to this guy! Hes a Fed! Hes out to get us! That was the environment back then. So nobody really cared for several years. For the first couple of years I probably did none of these for clients. And then I was doing one or two a year. Stuff like that, for just various oddballs. Then 2017 happened, right? With the bull rally in 2017 all of a sudden there was interest in this! Bitcoin, of course, and then a lot of it was shitcoiners too, because the structure  I mean I market it for Bitcoin because thats all I care about but it works for all those shitcoins as well. There was a lot of interest in it and it started to become a bigger and bigger part of my practice! Even when the rally ended in 2017 it didnt just die off as an a practice area for me. It just has grown over time to now its like three-quarters of what I do!", "image": null}

So the idea behind it is, wouldnt it be nice to be able to use those tax-advantaged funds to hold Bitcoin and to hold the Bitcoin directly such that you could hold your own keys? And thats advantageous for two reasons: (1) if youre doing it in a way that youre holding your own keys, youre sticking with the ethos of Not your keys, not your Bitcoin, and (2) if you buy GBTC, first of all, you have to be an accredited investor, and even if you are an accredited investor and youre able to buy GBTC to a regular brokerage IRA, the fees are colossal. Theres like a 2% annual assets under management fee that goes to the fund manager. Its just  its huge. So youd rather not have that giant fee eating up your returns! So the largest obstacle to being able to have this Bitcoin and hold your own keys within the auspices of a retirement account is that, under federal law, to qualify as an IRA, there has to be a third party custodian. And that third party custodian has to basically be a bank, a trust company, or this other category called a licensed non-bank custodian that gets special IRS approval. So how do we get around that? To get around that I adapted a structure that had been used for several years before this for real estate investing through an IRA. Basically the way we get around it is: we set up this custodial account for you with an appropriate financial institution, but the only asset actually owned by your IRA is either a limited liability company or a trust. The structure works both ways regardless of whether you use an LLC or a trust as that entity, but its a state-to-state issue. Some states impose ridiculous requirements on LLCs like California does, so we use a trust in those states instead. The idea is the same. So this entity is the only asset owned by your IRA. You dont own the entity, its owned by your IRA. However, you are the manager of the entity, in the case of an LLC, or the trustee of the entity in the case of a trust, which gives you the sole control over its assets. So any money that flows into your IRA is then immediately invested into this entity, and once its in the entity you have control over it. So that requires  theres a lot of regulatory stuff about what has to be in the entitys operating agreement, etc. to make that work, but we handle that all for you, and then we help you get an account open on an exchange under the name and tax ID of the entity. Its very important  it cant be under your own name or social security number. You can use that account to then go ahead and buy your Bitcoin and you dont have to store it on the exchange, you can transfer it off the exchange and custody it yourself as the manager of that LLC or as trustee of that trust. You have to keep it very segregated, you cant mix it with your other non-tax advantaged Bitcoin. And thats basically, in a nutshell, how the structure works. Thats how it works for most people who are not self-employed. If youre a self-employed person and you own your own business, if you dont have any full-time employees, we can actually have it such that your company 401(k), believe it or not, can hold Bitcoin, and you can hold your own keys yourself. Unfortunately it doesnt quite work that way if youre self-employed and you have full-time employees. Then, the 401(k) structure isnt available to you. Youre stuck with the IRA structure. But thats what I more or less spend all my time doing all day.", "image": null}

But yeah, you feel terrible, and youre just not nearly as strong. You lose significant strength in getting ready for a show. Ill give you an idea: I am 190 pounds sitting here right now, and I have a six pack  its not the most razor sharp six pack but if I took my shirt off youd definitely see all six of my abs and I would look great at the beach, right? Thats at 190 pounds, Im 5'11\". If I was gonna compete, Id probably be competing at about 170, maybe the low 170s, and I would have to start losing close to 20 pounds to get on stage right now. That would take me probably about 45 months to get ready, because you cant lose that too quick  youll lose all your muscle. So think about what an unhealthily lean level that is. Like, if Im already  what by normal stands would already be considered lean  and Id have to drop another almost 20 pounds to get on stage. Its brutal! Which is why its mostly a self-discipline sport.

I have very, very long limbs, thats horrible for bodybuilding, because my biceps and my quads just never look as impressive because theyre stretched over a longer distance. I have extremely long limbs considering Im only 5'11\"  Im not 6'8\" or something like that. But if you wanna get out there and put out your best package on stage its a self-discipline issue, its being able to lose all that weight and spend 45 months in a diet losing weight. When I say in a diet, Im dieting Im not eating junk, Im monitoring what Im eating all year round. Its just the sheer volume of what youre eating gets so low. I mean by the time I got on stage this most recent time, I was almost down to a thousand calories a day. And youre not doing that low of a caloric intake the whole time, youre ratcheting it down slowly over time, but its very difficult. And the reason why  to get to your point  its all just self-discipline. And I guess that probably on some level is a function of time-preference: being able to delay that gratification or have that level of self-discipline, to put that level of work in.", "image": null}

You mentioned enhanced, and youre bodybuilding in a natural way. Would you have an opinion on the enhanced process? When I was going to high school, there were a lot of kids in my high school, my peers  I played soccer, basketball  but like football team, lacrosse team, wrestling team, it was just like, a bunch of weightlifters trying to get girls. There were just steroids everywhere! When I got to college, it was a cosmetic thing. My opinion is, youre above 18  I dont care! And Ill go further, Ill look at someone like Barry Bonds, Im kind of psyched he did steroids, because there were other guys doing steroids, doing things that were kinda maybe better on paper, but Im like, I wanna see the greatest ever take this medicine and do what he can do! If he wants to take the risk and the consequences of his actions for high time preference results!", "image": null}

That said, I dont really have a problem with enhanced bodybuilding at all, and steroids in general, too. To be honest, based on the research and the data that we have, if you do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way, youre gonna look awesome! If you work as hard as me and you do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way and we have equal genetics, lets say, youre gonna look 1,000x better than me! And youre probably gonna be fine! Its probably not gonna affect your longevity or your overall health. The issue is, and I dont have a problem with these guys doing it, you cant do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way and compete in enhanced bodybuilding. Its just not how it works! You have to take the drugs to a much more extreme level that probably is gonna have damage to your health. Theres ways to mitigate that. There are guys out there that competed in bodybuilding and do live long lives, because even under the auspices of being more extreme, they still did it the smartest way they could, and they also were probably better genetically suited with the drugs  thats another part that no one talks about. But for me, I never went enhanced because  I wanted to be able to compete, and I didnt want to have to do the drugs in such an extreme way. And if you dont do it in an extreme way and you try and compete, youre just gonna look terrible compared to guys that do! Youre just not gonna be able to compete. So for me, natural was a no-brainer for that reason. But I definitely dont have a problem with people  if you just are like recreationally lifting and you dont want to compete, and you want to do steroids, I would say, Just be smart about it, get your blood work done, do it in consultation with a doctor. I dont really see anything wrong with that at all! The only time it would really bother me, is if youre doing steroids and youre trying to sneak into one of our shows and compete with us! You have your own shows for that! Let us have our thing, let us compete  thats our thing. But other than that, I certainly dont have  I have unnamed friends that do steroids. Id never try to talk them out of it or anything.", "image": null}

Just to kick off, though, you mention that each generation improves its lot as compared to the one before, but an economic system can only last as long as thats happening. So how to you frame up  you talk a lot about the 20th century and what happened there, but you use a lot of terminology like neo-liberal, globalist-capitalist, social democracy, market socialism, socialism. So if you could level-set a bit, so that we can get into some of these topics and what these words mean to you before we go further?

And part of the issue is different people can define them differently. So for instance to a Marxist, the type of economic system that I talk about, they would still consider that capitalist. But a distributist wouldnt. So Ill just talk about the way that I define these terms, so that we could at least be consistent. Sometimes maybe Ill even draw some distinctions on how other people may define them. Capitalism to me is basically a market-based economy, more or less. And a market-based economy where competition is held to the inherently good, and where you do not want to interfere with the market itself. Like what Mises would call a hampered market. Im not including that within the definition of capitalism for purposes of what Im talking about. So, were in right now what I would still consider a capitalist society and Libertarians would balk at that because theyll say, Oh! Well theres all these government regulations, theres all these things that affect the market! But the reason I still consider that capitalistic is because there are usually regulatory structures and other structures that are just prop up the market system itself from collapsing. Theyre in fact not designed to hampered the market, theyre designed to keep it going at least for the benefit of the people that have the largest amount of market power, okay? Thats how I would define a capitalist system. A socialist system to me is one thats based on socialized production. Meaning that you dont have private ownership of the means of production in the ways that were used to. The workers arent in control of the means of production and that could be through  there are a zillion different flavors of socialism, right  you could have libertarian socialists where theres not a state thats really mediating that versus a Marxist-Leninist where there is a very centralized state thats mediating that. I wont get into all those distinctions right now. But those were the two competing schools of thought more or less throughout the 20th century and even into the 21st. The 20th century specifically was defined by the conflict between capitalist and socialist production. There were other economic systems that were posited during that period that never really got too much traction. Social democracy to me  which really did take off in the latter half of the 20th century  was more or less an attempt to prop up the capitalist system through transfers. The workers dont really have power in most social democratic systems that we see today. Theyre just thrown tax transfer payments and stuff like that just to keep the system going, to prevent them from starving, creating trouble, revolting, things of that nature. And if you take that out far enough, social democracy and things like that, what will start happening is  and this is what I think were seeing right now  were seeing a system where over time what happens is capital always seems to centralize. That seems to be the natural thing  if you have a market, eventually someones gonna win in that market. And when they win and they put their competitors out of business, their accumulation of capital is going to accelerate. Weve seen this many times throughout history. And once capital fully accelerates to the point where we just say  say you have a small oligarchy of players that own all the capital in a given market  thats when you end up at something that Hillaire Belloc would have called the servile state. And in the servile state you have a small oligarchy that controls all the means of production, and they actually voluntarily throw benefits  they could be government benefits or private benefits, that distinction is useless for reasons we can talk about ", "image": null}

So let me be clear about that  but, the type of Marxism thats taught in the university system in the United States really isnt based on Marxs ideas, its more based on ideas that came later during the mid to late 20th century that claimed to be intellectual successors to Marx. And those ideas  the reason I call it CIA Marxism: this is just true! I dont know what else to say! People say its a conspiracy theory but this is well documented  were funded by the CIA.

And that has become the dominant flavor of Marxism in the West thats taught in universities, etc. And thats what people generally believe when they say, Hey Im a Marxist. If you go back and actually read Marxs work, whats interesting about it is a couple things: (1) it has really nothing to do with any of that stuff. Marxs work is not even really about socialism.

The point I was trying to make is, he also died while he was still writing so we dont really know what he would have come up with if he had lived longer.

Some of which line up with the contradictions that I mentioned in my writing. Others of which dont. I dont agree with him that that made socialism inevitable because I think that the servile state is an alternative that the holders of capital would obviously strongly prefer and I do think is workable, unfortunately! I would wish it werent workable but I do think that that is a workable system. So I dont think hes right about that, but his critiques of capitalism are very interesting. And youre right, if you actually went back and read Das Kapital or you read The Communist Manifesto or any of his other writings, it really wouldnt line up with what people that are ranting and raving on the Internet about being Marxist are talking about today. So the point where this whole conversation started was: there are really two groups of people that are pointing out what you just said, that a lot of these things like the UBI are really in full alignment with the largest holders of capital. The first group is the anti-capitalist right, which is a growing faction of people at least on the Internet and the intelligentsia.

On some level Im probably part of that philosophically and ideologically. Because I am conservative. And (1) thats just a group of people  and they may not even all fully consider themselves anti-capitalist, but theyre people that say, Hey if we want to have what we consider from a right-wing perspective to be a beneficial society, a free and unfettered market is not a way that we can do that. And theres a lot of different schools of thought. If you want to really dig into that world, American Affairs is a fantastic quarterly publication that I would put in that category. And they have a very broad breadth of thought, people that consider themselves anti-capitalist versus capitalist reformist, those things probably in practice arent really all that different. And they even have some socialist writers sometimes. But American Affairs is a right-wing publication. But definitely not a free markets publication! That is not American Affairs perspective. And thats been around for a few years and its been growing like crazy. A lot of good intellectual energy behind it. So thats one group of people that youll see making that exact same connection that youre making. And thats starting to bleed over into mainstream politics just a tiny teensy teensy teensy little bit. You will hear Josh Hawley for instance say a watered down version of things that you might read in American Affairs. Youll see Tom Cotton say a very watered down version of things you might see in American Affairs. So theyre not really there, but you can see where this is going. The (2) other group of people are the people that still stick to the old religion Marxism. I dont want to get into terminology fights because a lot of them will quibble with what Im about to say. A lot of those people are now referring to themselves as post-leftists to distinguish themselves from the mainstream left. Some people dont like that term. Some of them prefer to be called left populists. Those are the two groups of people that you really see doing that. If you want to get a good flavor of some of that thought  and again its a very broad area of thought, not all of them are going to agree, many of them would even disagree with the way Im categorizing them  you want to read something like The Bellows, which is an online publication which is really great, really fantastic! Whats Left is a really great podcast thats of that general genre. My friends  who I was actually just livestreaming with before I came onto this podcast  the Good Ol Boys kind of do a fusion. I dont know if they would describe it this way but they do a fusion of those two camps that I talked about. People that are on the right and the people that are in that post-left area, they straddle those two and do a synthesis of those two. For listeners that want to get a better idea of that school of thought thats out there and developing, those are some resources that you can look at.", "image": null}

Distributists, which Belloc and Chesterton are probably most famous, have this concept called the capitalist paradox. It basically means when you have this free market going on  and Im not adapting this to the modern day, they wrote over a hundred years ago  the way you would apply the capitalist paradox to more modern ideas and even in their times was: if youve got this competitive market, your goal is to be the last one standing. Youre constantly competing. And the way you want to do that is by cutting costs. If you can offer an equivalent good or service and you can offer it cheaper, youre gonna win. So whats the easiest way to cut your costs? Its just to pay your employees less! Its like a no-brainer. Typically in a market you wanna pay your employees as low as possible while still getting them to show up to work and do their job appropriately, right? So whats the problem with that? If everybody keeps cutting their employees pay to try to compete with each other, eventually youre gonna get to the point where the employee class or the working class, theyre just subsisting. Theyre able to like feed themselves and clothe themselves and get to work, and thats about it. Theyre not gonna be able to buy your stuff! And thats a problem, because if capital is concentrated such that lets say only five people have it, well those five people only need so many shoes, no matter how luxurious their lifestyle might be. But if that capital is spread across five million people, theyre gonna buy a lot more shoes! So the paradox is that by trying to get ahead you end up impoverishing all of your customers and they cant buy your stuff anymore. Thats in a nutshell a very simplified version of the capitalist paradox. So the system  and when I say the system that can be a governmental system or a non-governmental system, it doesnt really matter because in a capitalist society a governmental system is gonna be run by the larger holders of capital so they can collude privately or they can collude publicly via government, the government is just a collusion mechanism  they are gonna have to find a way to funnel stuff back to the working classes so that they can keep buying things. The initial way that that was done early on was through charity. You were a really rich guy, a Carnegie or a Rockefeller, you would have all these charitable endeavors. And these charitable endeavors that were meant to help the poor, what they were really doing was just sort of recirculating capital back downwards to keep the system going. You had to find a way to constantly recirculate that capital downwards. And that charity stuff lasted for a while, but the problem was theres not a formal mechanism to make sure that all my other rich friends are giving as much to charity as I am. That can work for a while but eventually thats going to break down. Its not sufficient anymore to recycle that capital back down to the working classes. So what we did next was the mid-century era which was the New Deal in the United States and other similar social democracy programs in Europe. What they did was they actually implemented formalized systems through the government. Systems like social security  which Im not even opposed to social security  but that was the point of it. That was the motivation behind it. Just welfare! Stuff like food stamps, general welfare payments, all that stuff really took off in the mid-20th century. That was the idea behind it. That was the mechanism to recycle that down. And that worked really well for a while, particularly because during that era you had two things going on. You had that welfare system, but you also actually had systems to gain workers more power like unionization that also came about in that era. But what happened after: the power systems for workers broke down first, and then eventually the welfare re-circulation systems broke down. There was welfare reform in the 90s, a lot of those benefits started to get cut! At the same time, you had off-shoring going on so peoples wages went down even further. So that welfare system remained in place to some extent but it wasnt cutting it anymore. Not enough capital was getting re-circulated down. So what happened in the phase that started from the 90s to the phase were still in today, and thats the usury system where you just lend it to them! These people are basically living on a borrowed lifestyle, right? Were a debt-based society! So thats another way you can funnel capital back down to them and then they are able to then use that. Theyre not obviously using it as capital, investing it. Theyre just using it to spend to live or on consumable items. So thats the other way to do it. And the usury system is really advantageous to them because they get to charge interest, right? So not only do they make money on selling you stuff, but they make money on the fact that they gave you money to buy it to begin with! So money is being made at all angles there when youre dealing with a usury system. [57:13] And I should point out here that usuryIm using Hillaire Bellocs definition of the term. Usury nowadays we define as charging an amount of interest thats so high that its unethical or illegal. But thats not what it meant in the distributist tradition. It essentially meant any loan that was for a consumable asset. So a mortgage would not have necessarily ", "image": null}

The point of the government should be essentially to represent the workers in all forms. Which also includes  this is where Im not a Marxist  self-employed people who work!

Ill let you know what Ive gathered from it because I listen to you on other podcasts and I ran home and I told my wife about it.

So once it achieves a certain size  I dont know how we determine that size but youre like, Okay, we need to have 20% of the employees represented on the board of directors. In that scenario and Im paraphrasing you, now were not gonna have 2-day delivery because Im not gonna piss and shit in my pants, Im not gonna wear diapers as an employee, so were gonna be on a 4-day delivery.

So, distributism is primarily just an ideal. Meaning, saying that you respect private property so thats where it makes it a little bit different from a communist for instance. You very much respect private property, but you wanna use the legal system to corral the market such that private property remains very widely distributed. And that capital itself maintains wide distribution, which a free markets not gonna provide that. So you need a system in place to hamper the market, essentially so that such a thing can happen! And distributists throughout the hundred-year history of it have had a lot of different ideas about the best the way to do that. So its hard to say, Oh this is a distributist policy over versus this isnt. I can tell you the ones that I think are good ideas, but many people that call themselves distributists would disagree very much with my ideas, because its moreso an ideal thats never been fully implemented. So from my perspective, what might that look like in the real world? Im gonna answer that first into things you could actually do within the next 30 years that are marginally realistic, and then we could talk about pie in the sky stuff, right? Those are two different aspects that we can look at. When were talking about this, first of all its important to understand the concept of subsidiarity which is different from pure decentralization. Subsidiarity means power is exercised at the lowest level in which it can be effectively exercised. Not the lowest level altogether! Because if you fully decentralize things, what usually ends up happening is the strongest guy in this little decentralized world will essentially end up dominating everybody else and youll end right up back in a centralized system! A free market is decentralized at the beginning, and thats what happens! Subsidiarity says, You push just enough power up the different levels of government such that everybody is still getting a piece. Thats the idea behind this system. Everybody gets a little piece of whats going on, and its in everybodys interest to keep that higher level of authority running such that everybodys still getting their piece, and no one can dominate that higher level of government. Thats easier said than done! But Ill give you some examples of things that would move a little bit closer to a distributist ideal but are still somewhat realistic. Number one would be, as you said  first of all tax and regulatory policy that favors non-public small family businesses over large publically traded businesses. And thats just a value judgment. So if youre a libertarian and youre hearing that, that sounds insane! No, Im actually saying the legal system should discriminate against businesses that are held that way, and in favor of the smaller ones even if they are less efficient, to a degree thats acceptable. There are some businesses like a utility company cant necessarily operate that way. But your tax and regulatory structure in fact benefits directly those types of businesses. When youre talking about larger businesses that really cant operate that way  let me give concrete examples. Restaurants would be a good example of that! There is no benefit to having a Chilis on every corner versus family restaurants in every town. There just isnt, thats stupid! On the other end of the spectrum, you wouldnt necessarily want a different cell phone company in every town. That would be difficult, just the nature of that industry. So when youre talking about those industries that dont lend themselves to that, those industries just have to be very regulated, and theres a variety of different ways that you can do that. You mentioned one where those industries are gonna have to give their workers seats on the board. Because that is a form of distributed control, even if its not  ideally you would want companies like that to be co-ops. Thats the ideal. Co-ops are essentially a business where the workers own it. Its not socialism because theres still a market in play. We dont all in a society own AT&T, but AT&Ts employees own AT&T, T-Mobiles employees own T-Mobile, but its still run like a corporation. They elect a board of directors and theres still a president. And this is a business model that does exist! Mondragon is an industrial cooperative, a very large one in Spain, that operates that way: their employees own the business. That doesnt mean everyone gets paid the same. The janitor doesnt get paid the same as the CEO does. But there are ways to make that work. Thats the ideal, but it would be really hard to transition to that system right away, or anytime in the near future. In the meantime, what Germans call the co-determination system because they do this in their country, is a step in the right direction, is the best that we could do right now. And that system says: once your company is over a certain size  and thats an arbitrary line  your employees are gonna elect a board of directors. Youre not gonna operate solely for your shareholders anymore. Your employees are gonna have a seat at this table, theyre gonna have actual agency over their jobs and what they do everyday. Thats a baby-step in that direction when we cant get to that co-op level. Something that Ive been sold on too is a move more towards corporatist government, corporatist in the tripartite tradition. And if you wanna learn more about that American Affairs maybe two issues ago, Michael Lind wrote an article about tripartite corporatism. Its ironic that Im citing him because hes not a distributist, he actually likes very centralized businesses. But tripartite corporatism is not limited to that sort of a system. A tripartite corporatist system is one where  right now administrative agencies that set regulations for our business environment are just staffed by career bureaucrats. Thats how it works. In a corporatist system, it wouldnt work that way! Lets say the division of the agency that is controlling wireless telecommunication  instead of being staffed by bureaucrats what would happen is the government would legally sanction and recognize a union that represented all of the telecommunications workers. The workers actually would not be required to join the union. If they dont want to pay dues  France does this by the way, its not a pie in the sky thing  they dont have to join the union. If they dont want to pay dues, they dont get to vote. The union allows elections but they dont have to join! [1:13:06] This union is sanctioned by the government, and then the employers would have their own industry association also sanctioned by the government. And then consumers in that particular industry would also have an organization sanctioned by the government. Im describing it a little bit differently than Lind does, but its the same general idea as Lind envisions this. And those three entities, all who have competing interests, would sit down at the table and hammer out the regulatory structure that is best for the three of them! Instead of the bureaucrat that is detached from the consequences of his actions, right? So the union is obviously incentivized to hammer out the best deal for the employees. The employers association is incentivized to hammer out the best deal in the regulatory environment for the employer. Now if you had just those two, they might agree to screw consumers, right? So thats the third leg of the stool here in terms of who are actually coming up with the regulatory environments for these businesses. And they hammer out a regulatory environment that works for all three of them! And its an everybody gets a piece system. Its actually fundamentally a patronage system! Where everybodys just looking out for their own interests and using the government to patronize themselves. But because you have competing interests that are opposed to one another, everybodys competing to make sure they still get their piece. Everybody gets a piece! Thats the overarching thing here.", "image": null}

We have not been on such a path for some time which just means that the debt is growing much faster than the economy. This is not the time to act on those concerns! This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer run productive capacity of the economy as possible. The time will come againand reasonably soon I think  where we can think about a long term way to get our fiscal house in order and we absolutely need to do that! But in my personal view, this is not the time to let that concern  which is a very serious concern  but to let that get in the way of us winning this battle, really.", "image": null}

Back in January, when I started tweeting about this at the end of Januarymaybe at the beginning of February when it actually came out  with Eric Townsend, I mean we were laying into this saying this was gonna be a really big deal. And dude, we got so much  I mean everyone was furious! I mean furious! I had people just  you just cant imagine the feedback we were getting! Saying, Youre an alarmist! Nothings even happened! Oh thats only in a small town in China, and this and that. I mean I was just watching the video feeds out of China, in Wuhan in particular, which is a town thats bigger than New York City. And people just have to put that in perspective. This is a town thats bigger than New York City! And the firsthand account videos that were slipping out underneath of the firewall were crazy! Just total madness! You know, in the military, they send you through biochem exercises. Theyll take you, theyll throw you in a tent, its got CS gas inside there, theyll take, Take off your mask. And you gotta breathe this CS gas in. Youve got all this snot, everything is just coming out of your nose, because what it is effectively is like really fine shards of glass that youre breathing in when youre breathing in CS gas. So Ive been through these types of exercises. Ive done that in the military, and let me tell you, I know exactly what it looks like. And everything that I was seeing coming out of China was that! It was these kinds of exercises! [05:37] So whenever I saw everybody geared up in that type of equipment, in this  they call it Mopp level 4 or 5 or whatever that they were wearing over t here to me I was saying, This is really bad! And if this goes where I think this is gonna goand you were looking at the supply chains just completely shutting down in China  this is gonna be really bad! So early on I was very concerned about this! Now that its here in the States, do I think that every single state should be shut down in the way that theyre shut down based on the amount of the cases that are there? Another reference to the military  they say, Distribute the authority to the lowest level possible, let those people make informed decisions. And what youre gonna find is that you perform the best that way! So I think when you look at how its being handled here in the U.S., I think New York has major issues in the hospitals. Theyve gotta push that  I mean because it all comes down to your bottleneck, which is at the hospitals right? Their hospitals are at max capacity, theyre having all sorts of issues. So in that area its terrible! You go to other parts of the country its not bad at all, so why are these people not having the ability to work? And I think it really needs to be governed by the governors of each of these states, then it needs to be pushed down to the local communities as to how theyre dealing with it. And I think if they just took that approach they might find that maybe the impact to the economy wouldnt be nearly as bad. Is that what youre getting at with your question?", "image": null}

It was a deliberately vague and wide-ranging question! On the point of the pushback that you got from people about accusing you of being an alarmist  why do you think that is?

Hes making these really lame tired statements about Bitcoin. I was getting into it on Twitter with him then and I even offered to meet up with him  I was down the street from downtown at the time. He didnt take me up but we got into this fight on Twitter. And then a year later I was at a steakhouse during South by Southwest in 2015 and Im outside and a mutual friend of Pierre and myself spotted Mark Cuban standing outside the same steakhouse.

So I tell him, I won and I launch into a whole rant about Bitcoin and why he was wrong with his analysis and stuff. Well a lot of people would hear that and probably think, What a dweebnot being able to shut up about Bitcoin. Its true! But at the same time Mark Cuban was actually quite interested in the discussion! We ended up having quite a long discussion, it was like 15 minutes standing outside going back and forth. But he was taking positions like, The Federal Reserve is doing a great job, and we dont even really need to replace it. And Bitcoin cant replace it anyway. The real thing is blockchain technology, yadda yadda yadda. He ended up giving me his e-mail address to follow up, but by the time I got around to getting over the fact that I was accosting billionaires in the street and getting their e-mails for telling them theyre wrong, it dawned on me that, Eh! Im a broke college kid! I really dont need a billionaire buying the Bitcoins that I wish that I could buy! So because of that I never even e-mailed him! But the years go on and he pops out and continues to say stupid things. And its in this really annoying fashion! Because he does give lip service to the technology! He says like, Oh! The blockchain technology! At the time in 2014 he was pumping Cyberdust or something, and it was some chat app based on the blockchain, and were supposed to take that seriously. I can even imagine him trying to paint himself as not really being anti-Bitcoin, but hes such a normie about it, its disgusting! I finally made use of his e-mail back in September where I sent him a long e-mail talking about stock to flow and saying, Look, we can see Bitcoin be $100,000 by December 2021 and I left it at that. He actually responded quickly, I sent an even better response to him, never heard back from that of course. But I just needed an on-the-record, like, Remember who told you! I just always want to dangle that over him because thats just how it is. Also, he owns the Mavericks and Im originally from San Antonio, so he was just unacceptable on all fronts!", "image": null}

Because  in my very humble opinion  theres a very obvious flaw in his thinking. Viewing this narrative  this is the Cuban paradox. Its this idea  and it goes back to the Twitter war I had with him I dont know how long ago. But his comment all revolved around this idea that he allowed people to pay in his stadium with Bitcoin. And at the end of the first year he had like $600 of people that paid to go to his game with Bitcoin. So his deduction at that point is, Nobodys using this! And therefore its never gonna catch on! And therefore the price will never go up! And thats his thesis. And I think for anybody who  I guess this is me throwing him a bone and like empathizing with his position because I think for most people that are just at the micro-level, theyre at, Hey I own this billion-dollar company or I own this $500 million dollar company or I own this $1 million dollar company. The only thing that really processes in their brain is this, Well if you dont have people using it and theres no utility well then the price is never gonna go up, theres no one thats going to bid the price up higher, and then thats the end of their analysis. But I think on this one theres a very deep fundamental flaw in that thinking, because theyre not understanding what its trying to achieve at its most root and intrinsic level. And so what I would tell you  in my humble opinion  what its solving is its pegging global central banks. All of them  its pegging them. Its literally pinning them to a wall, and saying, Theres not gonna be any more of that! And if there is, youre gonna be held accountable to it! Thats what this is all about! That is Mission One! If youre gonna list out all the missions on a piece of paper, Mission One cannot be triumphed by anything else! You cannot put the idea of, All these people in third world countries paying with Bitcoin above it first pegging global fiat money that these global central bankers continue to debase ", "image": null}

You cannot out-prioritize that! That mission has to be accomplished  no matter what  before anything else can take place! So if you dont understand why thats importantwhich I would argue, tons of people do not understand why thats important because when you dig into it its really complex as why that has to happen  I have been promoting the living hell out of this book, but Im gonna do it right now, but thats why people need to read this flipping book: this book is called The Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth. And when you read this book youll gain an understanding as to why Mission One has to be accomplished first and foremost before anything else. You cant compromise on that! At all! If you compromise on that, theres gonna be some other protocol thats gonna rise up and be more important. [18:04] So when you look at, Well why does Bitcoin accomplish that over everything else, you can get into a lot of the reasons why, but if I was gonna summarize real quickly: Bitcoin just annihilates all the competition! And so going back to the Cuban paradox: the idea is, Well, if people arent using it in my stadium and if theres no utility for people to use it then how in the world is the price gonna go up? Well Ill tell you how the price is gonna go up. Weve got this quantitative hardening happening here in May: the halvening, right? So these miners that are gonna mine the living hell out of this. Look at how much hashing is coming online in this two-week adjustment that were at right now. Were over 10% leading into this thing, and the price has been, not spectacular. I mean it took the big hit, it had a significant bounce, but the price has just been kinda hanging around. So you have to ask yourself: Why in the hell are all these people bringing more rigs online to the tune of 10% of the entire network on this two-week difficulty adjustment that we have. What is it that they know that no one else understands? Well heres what they understand, is that as soon as that halving event happens, all these people that are spooling up these S17 mining rigsguess what? Theyve got huge margins! Massive margins! And guess what? They dont have to sell! They do not have to sell even after you take that reward and you cut it in half! Youre pumping out half as much reward and guess what? Theyre still in the money! [19:48] They still got margin! And theyre gonna continue to mine. Theyre gonna mine the living crap out of it! And not only are they gonna mine it, but theyre gonna sell less in order to offset and pay for their electrical bills than the people running the S9s that dropped out of the market beforehand. And guess what that does to the price? It drives it higher! Okay so everybody who heard me say that, what pops into their head is they say  the argument that I constantly hear whenever you spew that narrative that I just spewed  they say, Well, when you look at how much the miners are selling on the market, its a pittance compared to the overall transactions for the whole network. Thats what you hear! Well guess what? Youre using the wrong ratio when youre talking about that! The real ratio you need to talk about is, How much are those miners putting onto the market to sell to recoup their electrical costs versus the amount of fiat thats coming in versus the amount of BTC in people that are leaving that network? That net difference between the people coming and the people going is in the denominator of that ratio. Not the total transactions. And so when you change that denominator to the thing that actually matters, which is the net difference between people coming and going out of the network, all of a sudden you have a very big number relative to the amount of selling thats taking place to the miners. Which therefore means, theyre driving that floor in the price! And I cant tell you how many people miss that. People do not understand that, at all! Thats my opinion as to why this event thats getting ready to happen in May  and it might take a month, it might take two months for the gears to really click and to ratchet in, but when they do, the thing just takes off! Because the miners that are inefficient are completely out of the game at that point. That flow is not being sold into the market like it was before.", "image": null}

That to me is a better way of thinking about the demand side than when people look at like the exchange trade volume, and they say, Oh okay, well Bitcoin mining is a tiny percentage of exchange trade volume  the trading going on. Whereas to me the Unchained Capital HODL waves of people withdrawing from the exchange and putting it on their cold storage, that is real demand!

But for me, thats the only thing that I can think of that makes sense, and why you consistently see this floor being set. When you plot this price chart on a logarithmic scale since the inception of Bitcoin, why in the hell does it plot so perfectly in mathematical terms as far as the curve that you see? The only thing that I can come to the conclusion is, is that these miners are setting the floor. And the floor is completely based on that flow thats being dropped into the market.", "image": null}

Because the thing thats driving it is not necessarily the utility at sporting events or at coffee stores or any of this stuff! The thing thats driving it  going back to what I described earlier  you have these miners that are running new equipment that have huge margins that accept this reduction in the amount of coins that theyre mining, and so theyre selling less back into the market and then the price starts going up because you dont have as much selling pressure. So now once it starts taking off, guess what? All these speculators then step into the market! And then it becomes a speculative thing at that point. So where that transition occurs  I have no freaking clue! I have no idea where that transition occurs! But its just human psychology! Its just how humans react when they start seeing the price go up and youve got every freaking person on the street walking up to you and saying, Hey! You know something about Bitcoin doncha? Right? Thats when you know that the speculators are in the game! Is when that starts happening! When you start getting the e-mails from people that you havent talked to in 15 years and theyre like, Hey dude! Hows it going? Right? You know that the mining is not driving the price at that point! The speculators, the people that want a quick turn, a quick buck, the people that have no clue how any of this works, but they just want to make a quick buck!

Which I think has been the right way to look at it for the past decade. But we havent seen Bitcoin go through a financial crisis yet! And theres been speculation that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, its basically just like the tech-Tamagotchi thing that  if theres a liquidity crisis in the system  then Bitcoins gonna crash. That I think has been reflected by its correlation with the S&P500 since the start of the real reaction to COVID-19 and the financial markets. But I actually think that if you look at, for example, the Sharpe ratio for a 4-year holding period: the Sharpe ratio for stocks has crashed! Whereas the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin hasnt really moved very much at all. That to me is like, There is in fact a disconnect here, and Bitcoin is actually proving to be a better store of value even if the short-term people on Twitter cant really see it that way. And that it did bounce back so quickly after the March 12th liquidation that went down to like $3,600. The leverage in the Bitcoin system had already been wiped out in December of 2018. And then it kind of got rebuilt April to July of 2019. Then it got wiped out again March 12th. But now at $7,000 and holding steady, it feels like Bitcoin is undervalued, while stocks are still overvalued! [29:42]", "image": null}

Just because  now that theyre not just using QE, which was the primary means of insertion for the last decade, now theyre using UBI! And now theyre gonna have to coordinate both of those together. I was always of the opinion this was gonna happen! This was just a matter of when itd happen. I would have that conversation with some people when I told them, Hey! Even if Trump would be re-elected, it wouldnt surprise me in the least bit that UBI would become a thing! And people would look at me and theyd say, You are off your rocker! You are nuts! I said, Its just a function of the math, man! Theres only so much you can insert into the markets and everything thats happening, because your typical person is looking at this and saying, Oh! Well this is just because of that virus that all this is happening! Whereas, Dude  this has been in the works for decades! For just flipping decades! So now it comes down to  I mean, look at the NASDAQ. The NASDAQs booming! I mean it has a Bitcoin-like bounce to it! I think people that are looking at this and saying this is gonna be a Great Depression-like scenario, I think theyre forgetting that when you look at the charts from  and it absolutely could be that, so please dont take this comment as me waiving that, that it couldnt happen  I just think that the range of potential outcomes is much wider as to what we might see moving forward. When you go back to 1929, you didnt come off the gold standard until 1933. So you had this peg in place through that downturn, that 3-year, 4-year grind from 1929 to 1933, and during that entire period of time you were working with a pegged currency. You dont have that right now! Not only do you not have it in the US, you dont have it anywhere! [32:30] So thats where I think people that are immediately going to an analogous comparison to that, I dont think that theyre necessarily widening their aperture far enough! I think its wider than that! And the fact that theyre throwing as much money as theyre throwing at this, and  I hate talking politics, because I am politics agnostic, 100%  I dont think you can be successful in the markets unless youre politics agnostic. I prefaced that before I say this: When you look at how Trumps gonna respond to this, I think hes gonna respond to this with literally everything he can possibly throw at it, times 10! And so if thats a true statement, I mean, you could see people out of the labor market, highest unemployment numbers youve ever seen in your life, and I think you could see the market come back to numbers that you saw before any of this happened, even with people out of work! And I dont think anybody is pricing that potential in! And I think that that is a potential! I dont think that its a high potential, but I think its a potential. So what does that mean? And this is going off of what Pierre was saying earlier: this means crazy volatility! So if youre looking at risk-adjusted returns compared to that volatility  yeah! You should see the Sharpe ratio for the stock market get crushed! Right? Because not only are you not making any real returns from where this thing started, but now youre clocking in this massive amount of volatility, and no one knows where the hell its going next! Its completely dependent on government intervention! I mean it has been for the last ten years whether people want to believe that or not! Thats just a fact. Im not trying to be tinfoil anything, its just a pure fact that when you pump that much QE into the system, you havent let up since 2009, you go clear up to the brink where everything falls apart, and then youre not only doing QE but then youre doing UBI to the tune of $2,000 a month until unemployment goes back to the lowest levels we ever saw since the 1950's-1960's  is how long theyre saying they would keep that on  this stuff is crazy! This is total, absolute, unprecedented debasement at the nth degree that will literally make peoples minds explode! Like thats how much debasement were talking about!", "image": null}

Yeah its extremely bi-partisan that this is the right course of action, because this was what the whole system was designed to do in a crisis! In an Austrian economics system, where you have a deflationary money, people would be holding much higher real cash balances. And I think the inflationary system has actually ironically pushed down cash balances relative to crisis, and then when you enter into a cash-flow problem like we have here, theres no reserves!

The thing that no one talks about is when you have an inflationary monetary policy which weve had for eons, basically since Bretton-Woods. Even when we were on a gold standard from 1944 up until 1971, I would aggressively argue that you were on an inflationary monetary policy because of the debasement that took place through the money multiplier against the gold that was sitting in the reserves. Thats a whole other conversation. So if we buy that argument that weve been in this inflationary monetary policy since 1944, well what happens is you set up this incentive structure around that inflationary monetary policy. And when you have that incentive structure set in place for that long, you get the craziness, especially at the tail end of this thing, which is exactly where were at right now, you have this incentive structures that are not pointing towards each other and that are self-reinforcing, but now that are actually the opposite way and theyre self-ripping apart of each other! And the only way that I can possibly see that fixing itself in a way that doesnt involve mass social unrest, is for some type of deflationary force to step in from a monetary policy standpoint in order to slow that down. Because youre going so fast youre literally hitting the speed of light as far as productivity  sliding productivity to the left due to inflationary monetary policy. Because thats what it does is it slides productivity to the left so that the spaceships doors are ripping off, the whole thing is basically coming unglued. Youre going so fast, youre approaching the speed of light, that everythings being ripped apart!", "image": null}

And its uh, its called Bitcoin. Its a decentralized digital currency. Yeah so I actually kind of agree with you Pierre in many ways. I have this meta-feeling towards history where considering how much of politics has always been about getting your hands on control of the money. I know theres the classic Rothchild quote about, Give me control of the money and I care not who makes the laws. But Nick Szabo had a great set of Tweets once about, All of the wars that were really just plundering gold vaults. You go forward to the 19th century and people dont talk about this much but one of the pillars in the Communist Manifesto was literally full state control of banking and credit because they wanted to do things like what we see today! And a lot of these sort of battles of political ideologies in the 20th century were also  as far as I can tell  almost like trying to control the banking system, the money underneath that. In todays world youre going to want to have control of that and keep doing whatever you need for this thing to survive, and anything that goes against what youre saying is going to put a halt to this system, so youre gonna keep doubling down on that power unless you see that alternative, which is why its so embarrassing to see people like Thomas Massey, whos actually usually like a great defender of freedom and stuff, but its embarrassing to take that frame of trying to stand athwart fiat money saying, Stop! Instead you need to just look for the next gold vault, the next monetary system, so that you can just exit altogether! And thats what Bitcoins for!", "image": null}

This just does not make sense! You could talk about it from the oil standpoint  I think oil is the easiest one to understand: right now oils getting obliterated, right? Its down to $20 a barrel, the newest report out of the IEA International Energy Agency there, theyre saying that theyre gonna hit max storage capacity by the middle of the summer and that they expect the storage to continue to fill up between now and then, and then its gonna really get interesting! So what happens to the price after you cant store it anymore? Well then it really starts getting punished! So if a lot of the consumption continues to be down  and I dont know how it cant be with this many people out of work, this many people not even traveling  I mean I know personally how many times Ive gotten in my car and moved around in the last month, and its not even comparable to what I was doing before this happened! So when you look at that price and you look at the price getting punished, and then eventually people are gonna start traveling more, but in this time between now and these storage capacities hitting max capacity, these producers  now maybe not Saudi Arabia and maybe oil isnt the best example, because theyre trying to take all the market share from North America right now so theyre laying on the capacity. I know they just did a deal but I dont necessarily buy all that. But lets just talk about any other commodity! [47:14] Those producers that are manufacturing this are pulling that capability offline. They have to! Theyre gonna go out of business if they dont do it! So theyre pulling their capacity offline I mean all of this is just totally similar to everything you see in Bitcoin. Theyre pulling their capacity offline, and when they want to stand that back up its not like they just turn on a light switch  thats labor that they had to lay off that went and found different jobs, its all this stuff  so when they do want to start ratcheting it back up, theres quarter to two-quarter delay before they can produce at the capacity thats gonna be demanded of them. Well guess what happens to the price of commodities when that happens? They shoot up in a major way! Well now if youre talking about the Consumer Price Index its based off of the delta of the price that it was before. Well if you have these prices that are hitting levels that are like  not even understandable  like oil under $20 a barrel, which could get well under $10 a barrel, these numbers are crazy low! If you even have the slightest bump in any of that, guess what just happened to your CPI? Well dude it just shot to the moon, right? So that could very easily happen in six months to a year from now, youre gonna see that playing out in addition to the Bitcoin price in addition to local governments being bailed out in addition to the government stepping in and continuing to print ungodly amounts of money, people getting their $2,000 check every month, to just  I mean this is the scenario that Im playing through my mind as to how I see the world in 6 months to a year from now  thats what its gonna look like! And I just dont know how anybody whos experiencing that and then watching Bitcoin go up by $1,000 a day sitting on the sidelines and saying, Ah! Yeah, thats normal! Its not normal  its insane, it doesnt make sense  then theyre gonna start digging into, What the hell is this? Why has this thing not been able to die? Especially people in finance, when they see the market cap going over $1 Trillion, its gonna really attract a lot of eyeballs and a lot of people saying, Maybe I need to take a little bit closer look at this thing?", "image": null}

As far as Im concerned, you are so far off the rails of capitalism at this point already, not even buying the equity market, but the fact that youre stepping in and basically saying, Yeah thats junk debt! Lets buy it and keep these zombies alive! Is effectively what theyre saying! I mean dude its scary! I think thats the best way I can describe it is its scary that youre seeing that! But lets look at why theyre doing this. They cannot allow interest rates to go up. That is a fact! If interest rates go up, well now all of a sudden, they cant issue the debt at the volume that they need to issue it at. So theyre gonna do everything they can possibly do to keep interest rates at 0%. So thats where the calculus for them gets really difficult because now theyve gotta do UBI. They realize theres social unrest at this point with the amount of people that are out of work and thatll continue to be out of work. So now weve gotta do UBI. But we also have to continue to do QE, because we cant allow interest rates to go up or this whole thing goes boom! Now theyre in this tricky situation where they cant turn off either one of those spigots! They can only basically turn them off. So Ive had a couple Tweets and its hilarious because I dont hear a peep out of a single solitary Wall Streeter on my account, and I have a lot of Wall Streeters that follow me. Not a freaking word about the idea that, Youre gonna get inflation, but youre gonna get it all at once. And its gonna come like a flippin tsunami! And what it is, is its total trust in the bond market breaking down.Its at that point where everyone says, Hold on a minute! Oh my God! This is a tsunami coming at us! Oh my God! I gotta get up on a tree or I gotta get up on a building or Im gonna die! Right? And then everyone exits those positions out of these bond markets, and its gonna be a flippin tsunami.

So each time you go through one of these halving events, these quantitative tightening events, its Bitcoins attempt at trying to escape gravity and exit the orbit! And so last time we saw that, we saw the attempt, the speculators could have taken it to $100,000 and then you could have maybe gone further. But, all the market participants were not at a point where you had enough buy-in for that to occur! So what happens? Well the gravity of the two-week difficulty adjustment took hold, and it brought it back down into its orbit where it needed to remain, until it could ramp itself up and go through its immunization in order to get ready for the next attempt of its exit velocity! So right now weve got the quantitative tightening happening  its gonna make another run at it! Its almost like watching a high jumper: hes going there, hes gonna jump over it. If he doesnt make it he comes back and he does 1,000 reps on the legs and then cools off for a couple weeks and then makes another run at the exit velocity. So what were watching is were watching the next attempt! And whether it makes it or not I have no idea! I kind of suspect based on the backdrop of everything thats happening in the other markets, that you probably have a pretty high probability that its gonna make it this time! Probably a lot higher than a lot of people wanna give it credit for! But if it doesnt, no big deal! It comes back down into that stock to flow level that youve got all that difficulty adjustment thats gonna pull it back in there if you cant get enough market participants to join the network and bring it to total dominance. Its gonna come back, its gonna ramp up, its gonna get stronger, its gonna get more security on the network, youre gonna have new miners that are gonna enter  all of those things are happening, which are just making it that much stronger! Its completely antifragile! And theres plenty of people that have said that before. So if it doesnt make it this time itll make it next time. Its not going away! And its just a matter when it reaches its escape velocity! Im kind of hopeful that on this next one its gonna make it!", "image": null}

But yeah at the same time using the $100,000 model, even $300,000 actually is completely within the range of the stock to flow price points. I fact I think $300,000 would be pretty equivalent to the $20,000 this past round in terms of the scale. If I remember correctly Plan B said about 3x-10x the S2F price is within bounds before youd be really breaking that model.

So if you look at the first third of the four-year cycle, which takes you out to like the 10th November 2021, thats where you should see the price really hit its fever pitch through all the speculators and everyone stepping in. If you see the price continue to run way past that date, I would tell you things are really starting to get interesting as far as escape velocity goes! Then you take the next third. The next third you should see the bottom, whatever date that comes out to  I have not tried to quantify what that date it. But if you take another third of that next four-year cycle, thats where your bottom should be based on too much competition, the miners bringing it back down into reality, and then youre gonna see a bottom there because the difficulty adjustments gonna assist with so much competition entering the space for hashing power.

Now so youll hear people say that the US dollar is backed by the might of the US military, and I think that the naive way of thinking about that is that the US military is holding a gun to peoples heads, forcing them to use the US dollar. I think that the more sophisticated way of thinking about it is that the US military creates an environment where it is safe to use the US dollar, right? And they are able to repel opponents, adversaries, that are trying to undermine the US dollar and try to seize it. So to me the US military actually adds to the seizure-resistance of the US dollar, and thats why it is strategically important to have aircraft carriers around the world, securing trade routes and having a global financial system that is dollar-centered. And the way Bitcoin challenges this is not by challenging it head-on, but rather by flanking it in the sense of, Okay, were going to do this in cyberspace. And its interesting because the US military could attack Bitcoin in cyberspace, right? It could try to prevent nodes from getting online and essentially work with ISPs to kick people off. And it would be very challenging to route around that! We would have to have Adam Backs [inaudible 1:13:43] and Nick Szabos short-wave radios to go pirate. But its like, because were operating on a different battlefield than the 21st century battlefields, were able to dominate from a monetary perspective and now state actors are playing catch-up. And this isnt the US, even. Its like, Chinas trying to come up with their digital currency, but I dont think that they fully understand that the importance is in the networks, the peer to peer network, is the biggest advantage that we have as a user of Bitcoin.

Prior to Bitcoin it was a very strong argument, you could go with that all day long because in my opinion it was a valid argument.

Lets say China or the US has a major problem with this and they want to wreak havoc by shutting down Internet service providers causing issues with the satellites  all that kind of stuff. They can absolutely do that, and if they did that you would see the price in the interim absolutely suffer. Where I think that its gonna run into an issue on the long haul is a lot of these governments right now are having issues with maintaining support of the general population. Just because of the situation were in right now! So if they step in and they punch something in the face that was actually providing substantial returns to people, to your people that have never been able to make any type of return at all in any type of market, I think youre gonna potentially cause some social unrest, potentially cause  especially from some of these smaller nations that have been a victim of dollar dominance  which living in America a lot of Americans dont understand what that feels like or what that experience is like. But for every other country in the world they know exactly what that experience is like! And I think thats gonna potentially cause problems if you see some of those antics. So is it a risk? Absolutely. Is it a long term risk? Im not so sure. Is it a short term risk? Absolutely, if it would be implemented. So Im just trying to look at it as objectively as possible. I suspect this things gonna be moving out at a clip thats so fast that you have people  I mean lets face the facts: theres some people with substantial wealth in this space that can influence politicians, decision makers.

Nothings changed! The bond markets fine! Look at the volatility in the yield, they havent moved an inch! Because thats how they measure stability, theyre looking at how much of the yields changed?

And at the time its very obvious what it means when a bank goes bankrupt  its because they were doing fractional reserves and they went bust! So the state was having to get more and more draconian about it. First there was something about you had to go on a diet of bread and water until you could pay back everything. And it didnt stop so there was another like, If you do not pay back the debts within two weeks were gonna ride around town telling everyone how evil you are and then were gonna chop your head off! And there was still a credit crisis, meaning, even with that! So my takeaway from that was, the drive to print money when you have your finger on the printer button, whatever time you are, the human drive to hit that print button is just so strong that the literal Sword of Damocles can be hanging over your head and it wont stop you! And thats why we need Bitcoin!", "image": null}

I think thats what were all in right now. Its going back to caveman times! So we have the Mark Cuban paradox  I also think that theres a Warren Buffett paradox! Where the focus is on owning assets that have a cash flow. And we see this in Bitcoin as well with people saying, Youve gotta invest your Bitcoin with BlockFi or whatever to earn a yield, otherwise its not worth owning, basically is the view! Why is it that people have such an attraction to cash flow? Its kind of the investors equivalent to the business mindset of having an obsession with revenue, right? Of, Okay, how do I get Bitcoin revenue, and then convert it into US dollars to pay for my expenses  how do I get cash flow out of Bitcoin as part of my portfolio?", "image": null}

You know how vital free cash flow is to the business! Everything revolves around it! The valuation comes down to the free cash flow compared to the discount rate youre using. And if I was gonna try to defend Warren Buffett, I would say: he is looking at owning good businesses that have a moat around them and what I mean by a moat is they have a competitive advantage against all of the other competitors in the space. If he owns that business and the currency changes, the business is still gonna be competitive moving forward in that aftermath or whatever that environment is afterwards. So if the currency changes from dollars to Bitcoins, well all of his businesses are now gonna start accepting Bitcoins and then hes gonna continue to still have a business thats kicking off free cash flow that has competitive advantage! So I think thats just how simple his narrative is: he does not need to hit anything out of the ballpark at all! He just needs to make sure that he doesnt lose money for all the people that have entrusted his leadership and his expertise going through this! And so I think hes just playing a very very defensive game. I think hes very skeptical because he doesnt understand the encryption and all the technology and the mining. He doesnt understand it, he sees it as being a bunch of millennials who are living on hopes and dreams trying to pump this thing. I think thats just how simple hes looking at it, and hes looking at this massive hundreds of billions of dollars enterprise  I mean he has over 70 operational businesses, I dont know how many non-operational subsidiaries that all have $10 Billion+ in market cap of how much ownership he has, so hes just looking at it from that lens. And so if youre a young Bitcoiner and youre saying, Oh Warren Buffett, hes an idiot! He doesnt know Bitcoin! Which is very easy to says, because youre looking at it from your lens, which is, I dont have a lot of money, my house isnt paid off, my car isnt paid off, I mean hell Im living in Mom and Dads basement, and I need to break through! I need something that allows me to break through from this disaster of a life that Im living, and Bitcoin could go to $100,000 and I have 1 Bitcoin or I have 5 Bitcoins or whatever the number is, and thats gonna be my out! And thats gonna allow me to aggressively change the future and the life that I know theres a better version of our there for me!

My God! I just cant tell you how much my blood boils when I hear people say inflation or just like give their spin on what they think inflation is! I just  I have a hard time containing myself! Its a good thing people cant hear what I mutter whenever I type responses on Twitter! So if youre using CPI as your basket of inflation, well you can make inflation whatever you want! You just gotta change whats in or out of that basket! So lets just look at whats happened over the last ten years: you had central banks that provided ungodly amounts of quantitative easing into the market. So all that is when you hear the fancy term, Quantitative Easing  youre printing a bunch of money, youre going into the fixed income bond market and youre buying those bonds. Youre basically buying them at whatever price you want and supplying all that liquidity to the people that were holding those bonds, and then the government then takes on those bonds and theyre sitting on them. Theyre pulling them off the market. The way I measure inflation is its the frickin simplest equation ever! Its: the expansion of monetary policy balance sheets! So if you go and you look at all these central banks balance sheets across the globe and you add up whatever that delta is over an annual basis: Surprise! Theres your inflation! Its that simple! So if you are buying these bonds and all that money that youre printing is going into the fixed income market which then subsequently goes into the stock market  if thats where all the printings going and youre not measuring any of that  its not in your CPI basket, well guess what? Youre not gonna see any of it, period! Right? Like, how freaking simple is that idea? Just the simplest flipping idea on the face of the planet! But yet, I cant find a flippin person that gets that! Its mind-blowing to me! I just cant understand it! Well now that you got interest rates at 0% collectively across the globe, across all durations for the most part. I cant say theyre at 0% but theyre getting there really fast, and at the pace were going with all this printing, youre gonna get there across the whole duration in the US, youre already there in all these other countries. Once it gets there, now it becomes just a total farce! And that money is gonna start showing up  if they keep expanding the balance sheet of all these central banks at the pace that theyre expanding it, which they have not slowed down, theyve accelerated! Guess what? Its gonna start showing up in some weird places! Because youre not gonna see it coming out of the fixed income market when the whole thing is purchased like you saw over in Japan. The rest of the world is getting there, right? Japans just the front-runner. They got there first, going into 1990 through the 80s and everything, that place was booming! Well they got to this point, they got there, they won the printing race! Now everyone is just catching up, and its competitive devaluation in the basement. And all of that inflation is 100% there, youre just not seeing it because youre measuring something different. Itd be like, Pierre Im gonna measure how tall you are but Im gonna go into the kitchen and measure how tall an apple is and use that as a measure for how tall you are! Its just total insanity! I heard it in the Cuban interview! I heard it halfway through the flippin interview, he goes, Well in 2008 we did all this QE  nothing happened! We didnt get any inflation! So therefore  normalcy bias  its not gonna happen this time! And its just like, I want to bang my head against the wall! Well you go back to 2008, 2007, going into 2008 I cant remember the exact number but late 2007 your 10-year treasury was like slightly over 5% and so was your Federal Funds Rate was over 5%. In fact the Federal Funds Rate was higher than the 10-year treasury mid to late 2007! Okay? So if that happens and you go through this situation and then they drop rates and then you do a bunch of QE, then they even buy stuff thats not at the Federal Funds Rate but theyre buying stuff that further out on the duration of the bond yield curve. And theyre doing all this and theyre supplying all this liquidity into the system  well they can keep doing that until interest rates all get to 0% collectively all across the globe. Once it gets there, thats why this situation right now is so different than 2008. Back then they had so much interest rate to play with and they had it across the whole duration of the curve, they didnt just have the Federal Funds Rate left, they had the whole duration of the curve left! If youre gonna bid the long tail of the curve on the bond yield curve, thats a lot of flippin money to drop that 100 basis points! Like, people dont understand how many trillions of dollars it takes to drop the 30-year bond 100 basis points! Its massive! Its ungodly! I can go in and do the calculations on some of these tools I have on my websites and figure out what that number is, but its huge! Massive! People dont understand that!", "image": null}

Because cash is supposed to be 0%! And that as you go further out on the yield curve, youre creating more and more cash, and then when you get into the stock market  same thing! If youre backstopping the stock market, youre saying, Tesla stock is cash in a FDIC-insured bank  its exactly the same because we are writing a put on it and heres what the intrinsic value of it is from a monetary perspective. But that to me is like the inevitable slippery slope of fiat. If you have the ability to print money, why not monetize every asset and turn every asset into cash, because that is the most politically popular thing to do in any scenario, is to say that, No one can lose any money, and people can only make money, and that is the official policy of this government!", "image": null}

That is why theyre doing what theyre doing  they cannot afford for interest rates to go up, because guess what? The price of everything, and I mean everything on the entire planet, is based on interest rates, okay? If interest rates go up  congratulations! The price of literally everything goes down. Its just that simple. It doesnt matter if its a stock, real estate, a bond, if interest rates go up, guess what  the price you pay to own it goes down. And more importantly the reason they cant allow interest rates to go up is because then they cant issue the debt and they cant spend at the rate that theyve been spending in the past. And guess what, every one of em wanna get re-elected and they wanna push that funding and all that money into their district so theyre incentivized because theres absolutely no term limits for the people that are appropriating money! So if you really want to get to the critical variables as to whats driving this incentive structure that we have, it all comes down to those key points.

But generally on a business day itll be the same day, and youll be able to buy some Bitcoin! And subscribe to the Noded Bitcoin Podcast, share it with all your friends.", "image": null}

I can go ahead and get us started. I have been following Bitcoin since around 2013. I lurked for a few years on Bitcoin Twitter and Reddit, and then did a few smaller projects. Around 2016 I was selling hardward wallets on OpenBazaar if you remember that decentralized marketplace. That was a fun and interesting experience. I have a mechanical engineering background and I dropped out of business school actually to join up with a local company in the cryptocurrency space in Boston. So I went through the phase of getting really into Bitcoin for the ideals of decentralization, and then getting into some of the other cryptocurrency stuff and then realizing that Bitcoin is what actually is important. So I and Ken also worked for a company called Nebulus in Boston that was making a couple different products. And one of them was Obelisk. And we were making cryptocurrency mining ASICs for Siacoin and for Decred. And so from 20172019 we actually learned how to make hardware and we crowdfunded and sold and shipped over $26 million in mining hardware over a couple different generations all manufactured in the USA. Around mid-2019 we started to get really excited about the idea of building a Bitcoin hardware wallet. We actually were really inspired by your podcast series with hardware wallets. I think that was around summer of 2019. Specifically that interview with Michael Flaxman where he was saying, Every Bitcoin hardware wallet sucks! And so a lot of those ideas resonated with us and we just kept talking about it. Ultimately myself, Ken, and two of our other teammates decided to quit our jobs in the beginning of this year and start Foundation Devices with the goal of making the Open Hardware Foundation for Bitcoin and a sovereign decentralized Internet, starting with our first product which is a Bitcoin hardware wallet called Passport.", "image": null}

So my background is computer science, so Im the software guy, software engineer and architect. In my career Ive done everything from embedded systems and network protocols, device drivers, embedded databases, wrote a lot of C code, a lot of C+++. Worked for companies like Electronic Arts, Arista Networks, I worked for a high frequency trading company in Manhattan, developing data analysis and visualization tools, and around 2017 I got interested in cryptocurrency so I was a bit of a late bloomer I guess. I was interested in Siacoin which was made by Nebulus, and as I got more interested in that I got involved with the community there, I actually ended up quitting my job at the high frequency trading company and joining Obelisk as an employee. While I was there I was responsible for the firmware for the miners, the web-based user interface, I wrote the customer portal front-end and back-end, and actually I was the VP of sales, too, which was interesting! Also involved with a lot of customers who were working to find colocation facilities to host their miners. Over the course of that project brought two generations of software and hardware to market as Zach was mentioning. And that brought us up to today where now Im head of software for Foundation Devices.", "image": null}

Were actually really proud of the work we did at Obelisk. I joined right as the company was getting started as an early employee in the summer of 2017. And as you know, later in that Fall was the big crazy bull market. And so we launched this crowdfunding campaign for these ASIC miners without even having a photograph or an image or any really information about what the device would look like. So we said, Give us money and in 12 months from now well give you a miner. As you know with a lot of hardware crowdfunding projects, they can often spiral out of control. That did not happen here. We actually shipped every device that we sold, we shipped over 12,000 ASIC miners. As Ken mentioned, across two generations of chips and three generations of industrial design. And we manufactured all of that in the US. We were an average of three or four months late depending on the batch that you ordered from. We were saying we would ship by August 31st I believe it was, of 2018, and I think the first shipment started going out in October or November, but we shipped everything. And it was all within about 2030% towards the target spec that we were aiming for back when we started the sale. So I think the main contention is that the altcoin mining space is a total mess. And thats one of the reasons why we didnt want to be in that space anymore. Because it feels a lot like gambling. You can deliver exactly what you promise, or really close to what you promise, but what actually matters is the price of these underlying cryptocurrencies, and then also the other mining manufacturers. And so, Bitmain and INNOSILICON ended up flooding the market, especially on the Decred mining side, and none of the miners  when they received their devices in 2018 on the Decred side  made any money. So we did some cool stuff! For example, we knew that when we shipped these devices they probably werent gonna be profitable for the Decred miners and so we offered to do buybacks so that you could at least recoup some of your money and you can choose to reinvest that elsewhere. We were trying to be very, very friendly from a customer service perspective. We were extremely transparent throughout, so ultimately were really proud of what we did, and having shipped over 12,000 devices with only very minor delays.", "image": null}

So  Ill let Ken comment for himself personally, but for me personally when I got into Bitcoin, I was very interested in it from the decentralization and efficiency perspective. So I was all about, Lets get rid of these intermediaries, lets get rid of these trusted third parties like banks and governments, and lets just allow people to transact directly peer to peer online! Over time, though, I started to go really down the rabbit hole from podcasts like this one and Tales From the Crypt, from books like The Bitcoin Standard, and I just got so enamored with the Austrian economics perspective and about Bitcoin being the perfect money. And so between that and then being frustrated with the existing hardware wallets, then also knowing that we as a team had the potential to just design better hardware than what exists on the market today, we just felt like we had to do it! So we founded the company in mid-March and we officially started the company in April of this year. We raised a little bit of money from some small funds and angel investors, and we worked from April until now and were at the point now where were gonna be manufacturing in early or mid-January.", "image": null}

And then be responsible for those decisions. That for me was a big part too, just having the autonomy and the fact that those of us who moved on to Foundation all had really aligned goals.

And we also have Matt as one of our co-founders. Hes head of our circuit engineering. He was at Intel for a few years. He has a bachelors and masters in electrical and circuit engineering. Hes a little bit of a circuit prodigy. And we also have Jacob whos our head of supply chain who was at Formlabs previously.

So far weve done everything with our team of four. Between the four of us we can really hit every discipline of bringing hardware to market.

We benefit from those experiences at Obelisk where we did so much manufacturing in the US.

And I think Michael Flaxman probably explained all these shortcomings much better than we can over a year ago on your podcast, but we think that things like PSBTs are really important, having a true air gap is really important, allowing for really easy text entry and navigation to encourage best practices when it comes to passphrases or other things like that is really important. So we just want to make that is so easy to use that maybe we can actually pull users off of Coinbase and other centralized exchanges, and also have this really great open source security model, where not only is the firmware completely open, but the hardware designs themselves are completely open, both for auditability and also so anyone can build off of our work.", "image": null}

And our biggest fear is that were gonna see a massive amount of new users over the next few years during this bull market, and then throughout this decade, and that because its difficult to store your own keys, were gonna see all those users go to Coinbase or go into Grayscale or something like that. And its already quite scary where I think its maybe over 1% of the Bitcoin supply is with Coinbase custody right now, and thats just not an environment that we want, and so we just wanna be able to provide users with actual sovereignty and ownership over their keys.

And so one interesting aspect here and when youre doing a hardware wallet, some hardware wallet manufacturers in this space have chosen to try to provide the full stack, if you will. Like for example Ledger Live or Trezors web wallet. Whereas other hardware wallet manufacturers have opted more to just say, No were just making the hardware! You go and use the wallet software. So tell us a little bit about your approach on that part?", "image": null}

We think that at its essence, hardware is a delivery mechanism for great software. And we think that the software developers that are working on all these different projects, whether thats Specter or Casa or whether its the team at Unchained Capital or whether its these newer multisig wallets like Lily or Nunchuk just came out a few weeks ago  theres so much innovation on the software side. Our goal as a hardware manufacturer is to give all the software developers access to just a great device that they can really easily integrate with their applications, and then provide their users with more security. What that does is it allows for faster innovation on the software side. For example, Ledgers Live app only just added full node integration like a week ago, but youve seen so many other wallets that have full node integration over the last few years, because when youre more agile on the software side you can move faster. So that I think is key and important to us. And then theres also the privacy concerns: if you start to trap users into this ecosystem where you use your corresponding desktop app to also be a place where they can buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and then swap between them and all that kind of stuff, you start to create a walled garden, and you also start to collect a lot of data about these users. You know xPubs, you know IP addresses, you know all this information. We dont actually want any of this information! And so we try to carry that practice through even in our website and e-commerce store and we self-host everything on Wordpress or Woocommerce, we self-host our own analytics. We dont want to be giving data to anyone, and we want to be collecting the most minimal data as possible about our customers because theres serious privacy concerns when youre building this kind of stuff.", "image": null}

I broadly agree with you. Perhaps just to  it might be fair to give a bit of a context there for some of the OG hardware manufacturers like Trezor and Ledger. They were started in a different era, you know? Before some of the software that we have today was available. Maybe part of it is like, they had to do things a certain way because they were around at a time when the tooling just wasnt there. But now we do have better tooling and we have things like Specter desktop and we have things like Blue wallet which we might chat a little bit about. Certainly I think the approach of each party trying to specialize harder into their area and say, Okay Im a hardware manufacturer and Im just gonna focus on making the best possible hardware wallet I can! I think that makes a lot of sense to me! Perhaps the challenge then is, How do you make it all interoperable? I guess PSBT is part of the answer here.

When we actually started the company  you know, Passport uses QR codes as the primary means of communication to establish a really secure air-gap  we did not know what standard we would be using for QR codes. Luckily, Blockchain Commons, which is a non-profit group in this space, was working on that. So they basically developed this, its called [Uniform Resources specification (URs)] and thats actually what we use to have interoperability with the QR codes.", "image": null}

And thats currently used by all of the different wallets that are using URs whether thats Cobo, Specter, Blue wallet  some of them are using an earlier beta version which is UR 1.0, but they should all be upgrading to UR 2.0 over the next several months, which is the final version released by Blockchain Commons. And then 2) Blockchain Commons is also doing some other cool stuff like standardizing the export, so that when you go ahead and you export your xPubs, you are able to export all of your xPubs and your various derivation paths in a single set of QR codes. Because right now it can be complicated  each software wallet requires an export from the hardware wallet in different formats. So with Passport we actually have a cool menu to make it really easy to pair up Passport with all of the different software wallets. Were doing a lot of manual work on the back end to figure out, Okay, what format did they need this data in? So hopefully over the next several months well be able to converge on the format for that as well, and then it gets really easy because you get to pretty instantly pair your hardware wallet with your software wallet, and then you get to pass data over multiple QR codes with the same protocol, and then you can have an explosion of air gapped singlesig and multisig hardware wallet transactions communicating with software wallets on desktop and on mobile!", "image": null}

Now is probably a good time to talk through my experience of trialing the unit out. So Ive got a test unit as I mentioned earlier. I put in the batteries, spawn it up, at the start there was the, Verify on the website that this is the legitimate device, and then I spun up a small seed just with $5 on it as you guys had and basically imported that into Blue wallet using the QR codes. And so when you do that  because the entire device is air gapped, right ? so everything is QR or SD card, basically. So I did it with a QR code and from my perspective I thought it was an interesting experience. Certainly very different to the typical, Plug in a USB or Do the SD card. And yeah Blue wallet picked it up very quickly. For me it was just about making sure you had the right lighting so the cameras could talk to each other. But once you get through that, the scanning worked pretty simply! So I thought that was pretty cool. Can you tell us a little bit about your thoughts there around how its gonna work with multisig?", "image": null}

It works very similar for multisig, to singlesig. I think the biggest difference with multisig is that 1) you typically have more data so that means more QR codes. Luckily as you probably saw from Blue wallet for Passport, they can pass QR codes back and forth pretty quickly. So you could pass  I believe for the tests you were doing its typically for singlesig 24 QR codes  and for multisig it could be a bunch more. But even holding up your phone to your hardware wallet for 510 seconds is going to be much faster than passing a micro SD back and forth or plugging into USB. And so we think the QR codes make multisig really great. The other big thing about multisig is being able to import that quorum of your different public keys and derivation paths so that you can actually verify addresses on device. Thats also something great that QR codes work for. Its really easy to pass that information to the device in an air gapped way, using just a few QR codes that are encoded with this URs 2.0 protocol.", "image": null}

One thing that we havent looked at closely yet because weve been pretty heads down, but I did listen to your podcast with Stepan [Snigirev] from a couple weeks ago, and I believe Specter, while its experimenting with the idea of, When you display or you pass an address, youre also passing the corresponding derivation path for that address, and that makes it extremely easy to verify on the hardware wallet that the address belongs to your device. Otherwise what you end up having to do is you have to brute force or pre-derive a lot of different potential addresses on the hardware wallet in order to compare. But if you have the derivation path, you can just immediately go and check if the addresses match. Hopefully throughout 2021 well see some standards form on that side to make it just brain-dead simple to instantly verify that a singlesig or multisig address belongs to the hardware wallet. And I do think that the various multisig services  I hope all of them add this in 2021! Not all of them have the ability to export the multisig quorum information to a hardware wallet. I know Specter does, I believe Unchained Capital does now, I think they started that with Trezor, I think its also supported by Coldcard. I dont believe that Casa does at this time, I dont think that Blue wallet does either right now. So I think well see a lot of progress on that in 2021 and hopefully by the end of next year well just have really really easy standards to just verify an address on the hardware wallet and get people used to that as part of the flow. Because I think thats something that people arent really used to right now. Oftentimes you just quickly create a receiving address and then send to that address. I think being able to quickly scan a QR code of that address from your own hardware wallet and get the thumbs up that the address belongs to you is going to be a killer feature!", "image": null}

Theres a couple different things there. One is that users should definitely slowly adopt Passport, right? Were definitely not recommending that you go buy a Passport and then you throw all of your sats onto it in a singlesig setup. So I think multisig helps a lot there. Theres definitely a need for another air gapped multisig-friendly hardware wallet. In Michael Flaxmans latest guide, Im pretty sure that in his 2-of-3 multisig setup  for the third key  he wasnt happy with any of the hardware wallets and so he recommended creating a seed offline and storing that offline on paper or on metal. And so we hope that we can be that third option! That way if there is a bug or if there is a vulnerability, it wont impact you, right? It wont impact loss of funds. Theres a couple of other things that were were doing. One is, the hardware architecture were using is not like invented by us  its the same architecture that Coldcard and Bitbox 02 use  which is when you have the standard microprocessor and then a secure element chip. In this case were using the same secure element chip as both Coldcard and Bitbox 02. From that perspective its not like weve invented some new architecture. The open source component also really helps because all of the hardware and all of the firmware is completely open. If we were closed source then that would be a really really hard sell.

So one of the great things about open source  especially when youre dealing with GPL 3 code, which is very copyleft code where you open source your code and you only let other people use it if theyre going to open source their work in return  so one of the benefits of that is we have not started completely from scratch even though weve made a lot of changes, and thats why its going to be really important to have experts look at what weve done and test it out. We have not just gone in, started completely from scratch and just messed around and put together some V1 of firmware that is completely untested!

That Segwit vulnerability was definitely interesting, where you can get someone to sign multiple transactions and then piece together basically a fraudulent transaction and steal their coins. Coldcard fixed that in an interesting way by storing a hash of the transaction on the Coldcard. I know that also that vulnerability created a lot of controversy. I believe that was the same fix that caused Trezor to close down a lot of derivation paths which broke compatibility with various software wallets. So were really cognizant of  as we make sure that were caught up with everything in the space and keeping track of all the vulnerabilities, we wanna make sure that we fix things in a way that makes the software wallet developers happy as opposed to breaking any functionality, which was pretty contentious earlier this year.

Ill probably give just a higher level view of how we think about seeds and then Ken can take us through some of the nitty gritty, because we do something different than all the other hardware wallets with our main source of entropy. The way we think about seeds though  we kind of share Casas perspective on this, where we think that for normal people, seeds are really challenging to deal with. Our ideal scenario is that we never show the seed to the user. And thats a different approach than what I think all the other hardware wallets take. The reason for that is because, as Bitcoin scales to millions and hundreds of millions of people, I think a majority of people still dont really know what the seed phrase represents. If you look at the recent Ledger and now Trezor phishing scams going on right now  and Ive actually clicked through these websites to test them out for fun  they typically revolve around tricking a user into entering their seed in a web browser. I think that that just doesnt work in the long term for a normal person to be expected to write down and manage these seeds. So I think that multisig is really really important there. And one thing were doing as well  that you did not see in your demo because we havent finished this feature yet  but its the same way that Coldcard provides an option to do Micro SD backups. We actually include two industrial grade Micro SD cards with every Passport purchase. And one of them is for users to, if they want, backup their device to the Micro SD card, and thats encrypted and they can write down a few BIP39 words off the word list in order to serve as the password to that SD card  but then they never actually see the seed. They never have to write down the seed. In order to get the seed out, you have to have both the Micro SD card and the password. And I think thats a much better solution for the average user than writing the seed down. In terms of entropy, we have a few different sources of entropy in the device. We do have the embedded true random number generator in the secure element. We have the random number generator in the microprocessor. We also have an ambient light sensor, but we have something really really cool called an avalanche noise source", "image": null}

And we sample the noise and then use that sampled noise through a whitening algorithm and come up with random numbers. And weve done some work running it through random number analysis. Were still doing some more work there but its looking really really good as a random source on its own. And then what were gonna do is probably combine that with the RNG on the MCU and the SC and maybe the ambient light sensor to get a bunch of different sources and combine them together.", "image": null}

Meaning that, in all of these electronic devices on the market, you have a ton of chips that are basically executing blackbox firmware. So the chip itself is a blackbox because we cant, for example, go to ST Microelectronics  who makes our microprocessor  we cant go them and say, Hey, can you give us your chip design so we can audit it? Thats a complete blackbox. Likewise, we cant go to Microchip  who makes the secure element  and say, Hey can you give us the design of the block on your chip that has the true random number generator? And so whats crazy in the electronics world is that pretty much every key or advanced component has an embedded chip running unknown firmware! Thats also true of most LCD screens and capacitive touch panels. So if you have a touchscreen, for example, on a hardware wallet, it probably has two chips that are running unknown firmware. And so the great thing about using this avalanche noise source is that were able to create entropy without trusting any blackbox silicon. One of our design goals over the next, probably few generations of Passport devices, is to further and further reduce the use of blackbox silicon to the point where every single chip in the device is open or we know exactly what kind of code is running on that. Thats something that were striving for from the philosophical perspective.", "image": null}

In terms of that, I also wanted to ask about the firmware and how firmware updates would be done. How would they be verified and put into the new device. Can you talk us through that process?", "image": null}
{"title": "SLP238 Zach Herbert & Ken Carpenter \u2014 Passport by Foundation Devices: Air Gapped Hardware Wallet", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/slp238-zach-herbert-ken-carpenter-passport-by-foundation-devices-air-gapped-hardware-wallet-52b22e43726f?source=user_profile---------34-------------------------------", "body": "Ken Carpenter: Sure. So what were doing is were only allowing firmware thats signed by Foundation, first of all  with a caveat that Ill mention later. Were doing a scheme where we have two signatures that are required for each firmware update. Lets say we have five keys that are available: any two of those could sign a firmware update. Those would be held in different locations, so it gives a bit of friction to creating a firmware update for us, which is something we want. For example, I couldnt go rogue and publish a firmware update on my own  it would take at least two of us to go rogue. And so the idea there is to provide that friction. And then on the bootloader, the bootloader is the one that is in control of deciding when firmware can be installed or not. It will validate the signatures on the firmware, and we have the blue and the green light on the device, and it will only turn the light blue when the firmware has been validated and confirmed that it was signed by Foundation Devices. Thats the first thing. We are looking at adding the ability for a customer to add their own signing key and keeping that key in the secure element. That would be a way for really advanced users to build their own code and load that onto the device. So if we were to look at how that works: the user is gonna get their key onto the device and load their firmware through the SD card, and the bootloader will pause on every boot if theres non-Foundation firmware on there, just so that no user would be fooled in thinking that, Hey Im running legitimate Foundation firmware here. Theres always gonna be an indication that it was firmware that was loaded by a third party. Were also looking at a hardcore unit which would come completely unprogrammed. It would be probably a different SKU with a little bit different looking hardware, maybe different colors to the device and to the printed circuit board. But that would come without a loaded bootloader on it, even. And so you could basically hook up your own JTAG programming device and flash your own bootloader, flash your own firmware, and then decide to lock it down at any time if you wanted to do so. Maybe theyll be like 10 or 20 people in the world that want that, but we want to be able to support those people if they want to do that kind of level of validation and verification on their own.", "image": null}

Its code thats loaded in at the factory, and once its there its permanently there on the device and it cannot be updated with the firmware update. And so our design philosophy with the bootloader is to make it as minimal as possible so that it barely does anything except very basic functionality like figuring out what firmware updates to allow. And then as Ken mentioned, theres definitely some tiny percent of users that just want to load up their own bootloader and so, its not too complicated for us to give that to users because it just means basically diverting a device at the factory that we would have programmed and sealed  were just sending that off to a very advanced technical user, maybe with a little kit where they can hook it up to their computer and they can build everything from source themselves. So while weve made some key design decisions  were restricting it only to allow firmware signed by Foundation Devices, we are still offering some of these power user features because we think, from a sovereignty perspective, that its really really important for the people that want to be able to build their stuff from sourcethey should be able to build that stuff from source  and we as a company should never stop them from doing that. Because then its a very slippery slope to be an Apple-like walled garden.", "image": null}

So we know that when you plug something into a computer, youre potentially connecting it to the Internet. If there is any kind of malware installed on that computer, it would have access, potentially, to data over the USB. And we just wanted to close that down completely as a potential attack vector. If youve got an air gapped wallet that also has a USB connector, theres just the ability for you to get lazy: you dont want to do the air gapped way today, so you plug it in, and then you get pwned. With Passport, thats just not even an option. What we want to do as a company is provide people with options that basically do the right thing and encourage them to do the right thing whenever possible  like, the secure thing. This is a way, we think, that achieves that, where the only way you can interact with the device is through Micro SD card and through QR codes.

Because a Micro SD card is almost like a mini computer! You could theoretically have a compromised Micro SD that has some tiny little chip or circuit on it or something that monitors or modifies the data thats being passed. The unfortunate truth is that, as of right now, 1) were using micro-Python and so our firmware updates are by nature going to be too large for QR codes. You know, we would love to be able to do a firmware update via QR codes. It seems kind of silly if youre talking about hundreds of QR codes, but if youre making some minimal changes to certain lines of code and youre able to just pass the delta, it could be possible on a future unit, especially if we try to move to something like color QR codes or something like that in the future that can transmit a lot more data. Thats something that were keeping our eyes on. Just QR codes themselves are fantastic in terms of the auditability! You can always scan the QR codes and really quickly  either on mobile or on desktop  you can verify the output of that. So its much much harder to pass something malicious through QR codes. And just to add on to what Ken was saying about USB and maybe something about Bluetooth. Theres so many Bluetooth vulnerabilities all the time. We really dont think a hardware wallet should have Bluetooth. You could just Google Bluetooth vulnerabilities I think there are like 3 this year that are pretty bad. And then with USB you can do a lot of tricky things with USB. And even basic dumb attacks that you wouldnt even expect! Like Ledger had a vulnerability for example where you can modify the normal MCU on the Ledger  which is like the non-security chip on the device  and it could act as a keyboard! And so your first instinct might be like, Okay, thats a weird attack. Whats the big deal there? But if you combine those avenues of attacks with the types of phishing scams that were seeing today, if you all of a sudden have the ability to open a web browser and take the user to a website, maybe that website is actually malicious and its asking for your seed and it tricks some large number of users. So we really dont think that USB or Bluetooth belong in a hardware wallet. We also dont think that SD cards do either but were at a point where I dont think its possible to remove that. As Ken was mentioning, our goal is to always encourage the best user behavior and not give users any reason to trade off security for convenience which is what technology like USB and Bluetooth does.", "image": null}

However, each hardware wallet is designed differently so sometimes it can be really hard to take code from one and move it to the other, especially when you have different hardware in the device  different components. Sometimes instead of just doing a quick pull request it looks more like porting work from project to project  but were totally open to that as well. Weve also used other work and weve been really careful to give attribution to the different open source libraries. If you go into our repo on GitHub for Passport firmware, and you can just get there from foundationdevices.com/passport-firmware, we give credit to Coldcard, we also use Trezors crypto and modcryptocurrency libraries so they have proper credit and attribution in there, we use two different QR code libraries and we have a pull request pending with one of them, weve mentioned the Blockchain Commons stuff.

This definitely does not make sense if you hold $1000 of Bitcoin. If youre gonna do that and hold a smaller amount of Bitcoin youre probably gonna just have it on Cashapp or River or one of these other services. Or using something like Blue wallet on your phone. We think that from a price point perspective, its not like we decided to just start at this price point and then thats it  we worked at it from a first principles perspective. Its more expensive to make a really high quality hardware design that uses a larger screen thats more trustable. The screen actually is auditable, it has a no-embedded processor running a known firmware, no blackbox silicon, so the screen is more expensive, we have a really high quality keypad experience  thats more expensive. We use high quality plastics, the main structure of the device is casted in zinc alloy and plated in real copper. We have a processor that I think is the fastest processor by a good margin in any hardware wallet. Its running at 480 MHz at its fastest, compared to Trezors Model T which is 120 or Coldcard which is 80 MHz. Its significantly faster, thats both to run the camera and also have faster processing of PSBT transactions. Were also assembling the device in the USA and were physically on the floor at our manufacturer. And so when you add all that stuff up it does make for a more expensive product. Any hardware wallet with a QR code that is open source, that is running parts from reputable companies like STM or Microchip or Omnivision for the camera, Sharp for the screen, its going to be more expensive than your USB wallet with a small screen. And I think thats okay! Because, especially if Bitcoin finds itself in a really positive bull market scenario, I think that paying a little bit more money for a much better user experience, and a really great air gap. I think its a no-brainer purchase!", "image": null}

I pre-ordered it. But firstly, just tell us a little bit about it. What is The Fiat Standard? What are you trying to achieve here?", "image": null}
{"title": "SLP237 Saifedean Ammous - Fiat Standard & Fiat Propaganda", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/slp237-saifedean-ammous-fiat-standard-fiat-propaganda-96fc9f58d69b?source=user_profile---------35-------------------------------", "body": "Saifedean Ammous: The Fiat Standard was born out of the questions that were left unanswered in The Bitcoin Standard. So The Bitcoin Standard explained how Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented in terms of its salability across time, it beats anything else that weve ever had because it has the highest stock to flow ratio, and it gave plenty of examples of how this generally means that this leads to Number go Up technology, which unfortunately I hadnt had the term when I wrote the book! It would have a lot if I could have just explained NgU technology! Because of the increase in the value of the harder money, eventually it ends up dominating the other monies and driving them out of the market. So given that that is the implication of the Bitcoin standard, it would be interesting to imagine how such a process could unfold? How can the current monetary system be overthrown. And so to do that, this book begins by studying the fiat monetary system from first principles really. In a similar way to how I studied and explained The Bitcoin Standard in 2017, published in 2018. I looked at the thing, and I tried to make sense of the economic properties of it and tried to explain them with reference to debates in academic economics. And so I thought Bitcoin is a simpler, neater system, its a more advanced system, its a system that performs the functions of money and settlement in a far neater, simplified way that allows us to really discern the essential elements of these functions. And then we can apply that lens looking at fiat. And try and understand how fiat functions. And as I started to think in these terms, I started to realize really, this is quite a useful way of understanding how fiat functions. In a similar way, you and I went through a period where we were alt-curious and we looked into altcoins and read some of their stupid white papers, and when you go through this exercise of looking at the entire monetary system and trying to understand where it goes  wheres the mining happening? How are the rewards distributed? How are the transaction fees paid? And so on. You start to form a picture of the essentials of how this thing works. And so, applying that framework to fiat would be a useful of beginning to assess how fiat works, and then using that as a springboard to explain what happens as Bitcoin continues to grow and fiat continues to do what it has been doing forever.", "image": null}

I think with fiat, really, the killer app behind it is salability across space. The ability of fiat money, essentially, to settle trade across space at a much faster rate than all the alternatives that existed at that time, because all the alternatives effectively were based on physical money. Actual metals that you had to lug around and move around and put on boats, and sometimes the boats would sink while crossing the Atlantic or the Mediterranean or whatever. By substituting the credit of government  which is what fiat money does. Effectively, what fiat money does is that instead of having gold as the native token of the payment system that is international, you end up having the credit of the sovereign serving as the token. And so the token supply is essentially the supply of whoever can draw credit on the sovereign. Whoever can issue credit backed by the sovereign, essentially. So anybody who creates credit gets to essentially create new fiat tokens. And when you think about it this way it starts to make a lot of sense!", "image": null}

And I think that really aligns well with the way Carl Menger explains the origins of money. Hes talking about salability through time and space, and so really what is happening is some of this capture of the system happened because people wanted something salable through space, and more easily. But then what happens is people end up using custodians, they end up using these third parties, and there essentially is a lot of trust placed in that system. And so essentially it seems as though, as the system requires more trust in it  and thats where things can get manipulated in terms of the price and the ratios, the price of gold or the reserve ratios required, or the way you can extend credit in such a system. So, can you tell us a little bit about the importance of trust in that system and perhaps the mistakes that were made along the way?", "image": null}

And I think the focus there in that view which I think is highly justified, is that, you look at the salability across time of gold. You look at the stock to flow of gold, and you see that it offered us a safe haven. It offered everybody a neutral medium of saving an atypical money that was international, it was available for anybody! You could start saving from the day you were born and keep saving until you die and the same gold coins can continue value throughout your life. And you could take them anywhere in the world! And because it had a very high stock to flow ratio, substituting that with government money which had a much higher stock to flow ratio, at very high cost to society and civilization which Im sure you and your listeners are very well familiar with. But I think in a sense you would like it if those governments and central banks ran these systems based on gold, but if you start thinking about it in terms of engineering terms, if you have gold you are effectively having to trust in these people anyway. The gold has no  once you see Bitcoin and you see how Bitcoin functions and you can run your own node and you can run the numbers  once you see how this system works, you start to really think, you can see where the shortcoming of gold is from the fact that just moving gold around  salability across space in gold  is pretty inadequate for the 19th and 20th century. Well for the 19th it could keep up I guess, but for the 20th was when it really couldnt keep up. And in that sense, whether it was the Bank of England or the US Federal Reserve, they did offer superior salability across space. I think we kind of have to grudgingly admit that fiat just allows you to send money across the world in a way that becomes much more efficient than having to lug gold pieces around, because lugging gold around is expensive and risky. And if you just hand over the entire system to the government where you rely on the trust of the government, then the government runs its own accounts, it does its own magic, and your money gets from point A to point B. But, you know, occasionally it blows up, and its usually bleeding value, but you cant have everything in life! And obviously there was no real free market competition. We couldnt build a free market alternative around gold because the nature of its centralization means that you have to be moving along with the legal and political and traditional institutions of the country in which youre operating the system. So I think it is really the salability across space that is what gives fiat its advantage, and its what led to the compromise of the monetary supply. And you see that the story of how slowly but surely they went off gold, and then even though the price of gold could rise, it still could not displace a national currency because you just couldnt build a monetary system around gold. So everybody is stuck speculating on national currencies and trying to figure out which one of them is going to be the least worst.", "image": null}

I think about fiat in first principles terms. The whole book is almost modeled after The Bitcoin Standard in that Im trying to locate parallels for each. And so I went back to 1914 in the beginning of the war and looking at how fiat came about. How we moved from gold  and you see, back then, I think this is a really important fact  that there was no Satoshi and there was no designer and there was no idea about where they were headed with this design. There was no vision in 191415 as these countries came off the gold standard. There was no end goal in anybodys mind that in 1973 there would be no link whatsoever between gold and money. In the mind of everybody, the question was, When do we return to gold? How do we return to gold? And it was well understood that the return to gold had to happen. The Sterling Pound was a matter of national pride in England, and theyve been on this rate of 4 pounds  I forget the exact rate for 1 oz of gold  theyd been at that since Isaac Newton himself had set that rate, so itd been around for 200 years. It was only interrupted during the Napoleonic War, but they returned back to the original price! So during the first world war, it was initially well understood that were going back on a gold standard and yet they managed to drag this on for 5060 years and never went back on the gold standard. And we moved on to this system that really emerged politically out of the politics of World War I and World War II  not through design.", "image": null}

Another really interesting point I saw from Chapter 2 is this discussion around this idea of exporting inflation.

Exactly! This is digging in Chapter 2, Ive really come to realize the importance of something that is called the gold exchange standard. And this was a system where Great Britain had implemented with its colonies in the late 19th century, where  with some of its colonies  whose central banks essentially kept their reserves in London in the form of English pounds. And so, the Bank of England made a great trade on selling these colonies claims on gold which effectively these countries werent going to cash out very frequently, because they needed them in the Bank of England network. They needed them on the Bank of England platform, because they were using this to settle their accounts with all the other central banks for buying stuff. This was their foreign account, essentially. So it was kept in London so the Bank of England didnt really have to fulfill withdrawals for this very frequently, and at the outbreak of World War I they had only 31% reserves of gold to back up the English pounds that were outstanding for the countries that were on the gold exchange standard. So that ultimately was the driver of the problems of the Bank of England. Thats why they had to  not officially, they didnt officially go off the gold standard because they wanted to maintain their position as the financial center and they kept on insisting that that was never going to happen, but the problem started because of this, and the solution, in typical fashion to fashion the solution out of the problem what they did was they effectively sought to export this model to the rest of the world after World War I by implementing all these new international arrangements whereby other countries needed to hold English sterling pounds in order to settle their accounts. And so there was the Treaty of Genoa in 1922 where the US and the UK basically dumped their bags of mainly sterling  the US did a little bit of dumping  but it was really the UK that had the most bags because they had gone off the gold standard in 1914. The US did not go off the gold standard until 1917. So for the first three years of the war, the UK and the rest of Europe were bleeding gold to the US. The US only really left the gold standard in 1917 so they still had quite more gold and were in much better shape than Britain. And the US was able to go back to the gold standard in 1922 but the UK was not. So then this became popular  the gold exchange standard  they get all these countries to hold pound sterling, and usually it came along with talk about financial stability and international cooperation and, Were gonna need you to do your part by holding our bags for us while we print more sterling. And then this became more and more popular, and then this was basically what they did with the Bretton Woods Agreement, where the US copied the model and took it over from the Brits, and started dumping their dollar bags on the rest of the world. Its the same thing  its the gold exchange standard  wherein all those countries dont get to use the gold themselves! They get to use the pound or the dollar which are backed by gold, and they get to have a promise that, Okay, your paper is redeemable as long as you dont try and redeem it in any significant quantities!", "image": null}

And so, it takes some time as well for that process to happen. I guess its a process of capture. So the better your monetary good can resist it, well, the better you are as a society, stopping a cultural and societal degeneration, in certain respects. Its also important to  just talk a little bit about the politics of revaluations? There was a sense of, when the government or the central bank and theyre negotiating and deciding, like, Oh okay, youre coming to the table and youve got this much gold. And so that is like an indicator of how much power or relative strength you have versus the other players at the table. So theres a bit of a power dynamic game there based on how much gold you have. But that dynamic has obviously shifted in todays world, that we could argue that gold is not seen as that important even though central banks of today  some of them  still hold gold, right?", "image": null}

And its still the one monetary asset that is free from any incumbrance  well, up until Bitcoin came along  it was the only monetary asset. It had that. So its still kind of a big deal, obviously. But to be fair, I think its really more about who is able to command an international settlement network, really. Thats ultimately what it comes down to. If youre able to secure physically an international settlement network, if youre able to secure a settlement banking network that allows people to transact across borders, if you have the security over that, then it ultimately doesnt even matter if you run it on gold tokens or if you run it on fiat tokens. I guess its not accurate to say that  it does matter  because ultimately, if youre running it on your own tokens, we see what happens. It has to eventually become politically motivated. Eventually it gets captured, and its going to inevitably lead to all the problems that come with political capture of money, that have always come with political capture of money. Whereas if you had it linked to a hard asset, it would be very different. So one problem this shows us in the fiat standard is: it un-solved [reverted] the problem of money, in a sense. Because it prevents us from having this one monetary medium that everybody uses. This one universal medium, which is what we had with gold. At the early 20th century gold had pretty much already demonetized silver at that point, so it really was only gold. So we finally had this problem solved where everybody everywhere in the world was using one thing as money, and then fiat comes along and it introduces all these other tokens. And then theres gold  that cant be completely demonetized. And if youre looking for salability across space, if you want to spend money in the town next-door and in the country next to you and in the other continents of the world, then youre going to need some combination of various fiats. But if you want to save money for the future, if you want salability across time, if youre thinking about something that you want to keep for the future, then you end up having to think about gold. And so you have to hold some gold! And so this really un-solves [reverts] the problem of money, because now you have to  you have a much more sophisticated and complicated and error-prone calculation of: how much of my money should I allocate for salability across time  should I prioritize for the future? And how much of my money should I prioritize for the present  for salability across space, by putting it in fiat. And of course, if you live outside the US, then most likely you have to keep more than one currency in mind as well, so you end up with people having to think about gold and their local fiat currency and the dollar. It just gives everybody much more mental arithmetic to perform about money, and it makes the process of saving and the process of having a cash balance much more sophisticated and complicated than really it should be. Because if you had one form of money, it would be the one form of money that would have the best salability across space and time, and then you could just have that stash there for all your interspatial and intertemporal needs.", "image": null}

Something like 90% of all fiat tokens are digital. Its only about 10% of them that get printed out on their primitive OpenDimes, which are made out of paper. Its still a digital currency, and if you start thinking about it in that sense, its easier to make sense of how the network works. So if you think about the node in Bitcoin  what is the equivalent of the node in the fiat system? Theres really only one full node in the fiat system. Theres one sovereign fiat node in all the entire fiat system and its the US Federal Reserve. And that is the only node that is able to decide definitively on the correct record of transactions and on the balances. It can revoke anybodys balance and it can add new coins to anybodys balance anywhere. They can shut off entire countries and they can take money from any account and they can cancel any transactions and so on. So its really the Federal Reserve thats the one central node, and then there are the other nodes that are similar to SPV nodes that are the central banks. Which arent really full nodes because they cant really truly decide the monetary supply of the token that is on the network. They cant decide the native token monetary supply. And they cant decide on the record of transactions. But they can verify payments and clear payments for people within their country. And then you have the mining nodes which are essentially any financial institution or any institution that can issue credit, that can borrow backed by the US government. These institutions are able to mine. They cant decide on the record of transactions, but they can mine. Theyre not full nodes, but they are mining nodes because they make new money. Thats really the key analytical tool of this book, is that when you start thinking about what it means when you substitute the process of mining in Bitcoin with the process of lending. In Bitcoin you do proof of work in order to make new coins  to make new satoshis you need to do proof of work. In fiat you need to lend. You need to make a loan in order to make new coins.", "image": null}

And so it means that theres really  its not really easy to figure just how much money there is! The money supply is not very clear, because you never really know much credit is being created, and you never really know  and of course theres the issue of the maturity of different types of monies and what can count as money and what cant count as money.

And it makes it really look far less nefarious! Its not like  there are serious incentives for doing this because of the way that the system works. Once you have this guarantee of debt, it just becomes more profitable for you to get into debt, because every time you get into debt for something, youre allowing the person whos lending you  the financial institution that is lending you  youre allowing them to mine new tokens. And so think about it this way: when youre buying a house, you have the choice of either just buy a house, or buy a house and mine new fiat tokens. Imagine if that happened with Bitcoin: you can just buy a house with Bitcoin, or you can buy the house with somebody elses Bitcoin, and by buying a house with somebody elses Bitcoin, they get to mine new Bitcoin. They bring new Bitcoin about! Which one of these things do you think is going to be cheaper?

Because if your country had adopted industrialization and the gold standard, which usually came hand in hand  by the time you had a gold standard, you needed a gold standard because you had developed enough of the division of labor that you were importing and exporting so much that your producers needed something like a gold standard  so once a country had a gold standard and became industrialized, that country will have developed a basic industrial base and have sound money. After World War I happened, if your country had not done that by then  these countries became the developing world, more or less these countries had not developed enough industrial capacity and had not imported enough of the modern technologies of the industrial revolution by the early 20th, and were still agrarian economies  after 1914, there would be no more gold standard for them to trade with the rest of the world, and world trade would just get messed up, so they never managed to get to that level of industrialization and that was a massive impediment in their development.", "image": null}

Its completely detrimental if youre not able to have a sound money. If you think about it, the countries that didnt develop industrially by the early 20th century, they spent the rest of the 20th century  most of them  going through one financial crisis and one hyperinflation and high inflation, all of these coming one after the other all throughout the last century or so. These countries that didnt develop this monetary tradition of sound money and didnt adopt industrialization just  by the 1940s and 50s and 60s when they were trying to industrialize the world was so massively protected. And protectionism had increased so much  and protectionism had started to increase after World War I precisely because of the monetary problems caused by going off the gold standard. There was very little problem with trade before World War I because when they were on the gold standard, nobody had balance of payments problems. If people bought a lot of things from abroad they lost gold and the other country made more gold and carried on! You had more stuff they had more gold, or the other way around. And if you wanted more gold, stop buying stuff! If you want more stuff, stop hoarding gold! It was a simple economic decision that everybody had. But once the currencies became disconnected from gold and prices domestically started to vary and governments tried to keep the currencies nominally at the same interest rates, you would get a difference in real prices across countries, which would lead to large movements of capital and goods and trade changes. So for somebody, the pound was overvalued after World War I for instance, and because the pound is overvalued, the British are trying to get their gold out of Britain as much as they can because it would be profitable for them to just sell it in the US and get dollars for it and then exchange the dollars in London. And then the same thing happens with trade. The country that has an undervalued currency finds its goods becoming more and more attractive for foreigners and so started exporting more, and a country with an overvalued currency doesnt export and that causes problems for its producers. And so the whole thing leads to problems in trade and that leads to tariffs and all these restrictions on trade, which then really hamper the ability of the developing world to catch up, because they hadnt grown  they didnt have a gold standard, and they didnt have access to world markets. And world markets werent open as they used to be. I think the transfer of technology that we couldve had if we had stayed on the gold standard after 1914 would have been much much much larger. The developing world would have been in a much better shape if the gold standard had continued and would have been able to buy and sell. Because industrialization was spreading all around the world and engines were going everywhere and electricity was going up everywhere. World War I comes along and the gold standard falls and the whole thing goes to shit.", "image": null}

Its quite amazing even in places like Lebanon, people just continue to maintain faith in this. I remember I was speaking to a group from Lebanon a few months ago when the Lira had lost something like 6070% of its value at that time against the US dollar in just 67 months, and after presenting Bitcoin and the case for Bitcoin and the supply and all of that stuff, one of the first questions I got was, well without a central bank what guarantees the value of Bitcoin? From somebody living in Lebanon who just saw their central bank guaranteed currency lose 6070% of its value, they still think of the central bank as being the reason that their currency is guaranteed to have value! They think that without the central bank, we wouldnt be able to have money and the money wouldnt be able to have value. The central bank messed up now  reasons happened  and now the currency has slipped up, but you know, things like that can happen to the best of us!

I would laugh in class and would tell the students this is not true! There is no way that you can make something risk-free, let alone the bonds of your government! The government that had managed to destroy a power grid and un-invent electricity! Its not risk-free! Definitely not risk-free lending! But its amazing, its a mental construct that just has to emerge around fiat money where the government propaganda creates this idea that this thing is risk-free and everybody believes in it. It continues to work until it doesnt work. But there was never really a good reason to suspect it works. And fortunately with Bitcoin theres never really a good reason to have to deal with it or have to believe it because now we have an option to exit from it and thats the beautiful thing about Bitcoin!", "image": null}

Basically everybodys being enslaved to their future self. Or everybody is enslaving their future self, I should say. Youre putting your future self in debt for yourself, for you to be able to spend tomorrow. And everybody is stuck in that. The sad thing about it  well its not very sad  you have to stay on this treadmill even as you start getting more money. Its not like the rich people can just well I mean they can obviously  but if they just opt out of the system they would be giving up on serious wealth. Whereas if they just take on more debt, then theyll be able to essentially beat inflation. So everybody has an incentive to stay on the treadmill. Everybody has an incentive to stay indebted. Everybody has an incentive to continue to live with a relatively close margin to economic problems and economic hardships and massive financial instability in their lives because everything is running on debt, everything is fragile, a couple of mispaid checks and business goes bad and you lose the business. So this kind of stress takes its toll on people, and the way that the fiat system works is that the only way that you can opt out of this  no matter how much money you have  is through giving up on significant money.

You look at it all over and you start realizing that for small businesses and for large businesses, one of the most important components of success is knowing how to manage debt. And managing debt successfully  particularly for large businesses  basically debt arbitrage, interest rate arbitrage. This is what large companies do. Many large companies are essentially hedge funds today. If you think about what IBM does  IBMs a hedge fund! They are big enough that they can get cheaper credit than pretty much anyone, and they invest very far and very wide and thats ultimately more of their business I think at this point than anything else! So really managing debt and managing the process of creating debt and borrowing and lending is the key to success. Which I think is quite wasteful! Because if you had had an advanced monetary system like Bitcoin youd just have computers doing the slave work! It wouldnt have to be mining every day by getting into debt and worrying about our finances and worrying about missing two paychecks and becoming homeless and so on. You wouldnt have this insecurity with your house with your job  all of this fragility  because youre having to mine. Youll just have computers doing the mining!

When you think about the fiat standard, when I studied it, my conclusion is that, Yeah, try and get into as much debt as you can! Try and get as much Bitcoin as you can! Thats really the winning way of playing this game, because Bitcoin is a hard asset, they cant make more of it, but they can make more fiat. So if youre playing the fiat game, if youre able to get debt, youre able to get ahead with it, unfortunately. But if youre able to secure with Bitcoin  the incredible thing is that now we have the entrepreneurial opportunity to bootstrap the alternative to the debt-based system. Instead of having to continue to monetize debt and continue to live in this world where everybody has to get into debt, and everybody has to mine debt in order to continue to function economically, you can start monetizing a hard asset. And you monetize this hard asset by holding Bitcoin and are effectively rewarded for this entrepreneurial bet on Bitcoin through the significant amount of NgU technology that is happening. The rise in the price of Bitcoin is the entrepreneurial call being successful. This thing is rising, and it shows that the value of this monetary system is increasing. As this continues to go up, we have the alternative to that! Thats the lesson. In the long run, I think one plausible attack vector you could think about is that there would be some kind of separation where you cant buy Bitcoin if you get into fiat debt or vice versa. This might be one way that they begin to fight back to try and prevent this kind of thing, but otherwise, its really exciting to watch this going on as long as it can!

Of course, people will find ways and there will probably be people doing this kind of thing.

This is amazing! Im really psyched to talk to you! Youre very influential on my understanding or coming to grips with Bitcoin. I was revisiting your workbecause Ive kept up with your stuff since 2017 for the most part, and theres so much to cover  but when I was revisiting your work, there were a couple things that really stood out to me, maybe because of who I am? One, youre an educator, and two youre a goal-setter. You achieve goals. And youve contributed to Bitcoin Core. And I think about those three things, and we can go into why those things stick out to me. But my question to you is: Bitcoin changes you is an expression. You cant change Bitcoin  it changes you! And I was thinking about that and its relation to you, and your work that youve put out. And when you speak, I kind of hear, like, Bitcoin Core! I kind of hear, like, the voice from the inside! It was even striking to me how you alliterate your articles! And your writing. And I wonder, how did Bitcoin change you, and do you think working on Bitcoin Core changed you differently than maybe people who learn about Bitcoin from a very different lens? Because I think, Well, maybe Bitcoins changing me from the outside in? But maybe Bitcoin changed you from the inside out? Im not sure!", "image": null}

I would say that Bitcoin has changed me in a lot of ways. But its part of I think just coming into maturity just as a man, and Bitcoin was a part of that process. Im 44 years old, and when I started this journey I was 35 or something like that. You know, I have kids and everything, and part of coming to terms with having a family and trying to provide for my family and things like that brought certain questions to my mind, especially after 2008. About, How am I going to prep for their future? And things like that. Because it was clear to me after 2008 that this system was extremely fragile. And when I saw Bitcoin, when I found out about it, I think it really struck a chord with me in large part because of what I was looking for, which was a good place to park my money, actually! To invest and put something towards the future! And that sort of low time preference, long term time orientation kind of view, thats what really struck me about Bitcoin, and thats something that has been developed in me as a result of Bitcoin. Not the least of which is Bitcoin itself! I put out a Tweet the other day, I used to love shopping for bargains! Id go all the websites for the bargain deals and Id feel awesome when Id get something like $100 less than what everyone else paid for it, or whatever. I mean I used to do like the crazy rebate games and stuff like that, Id get things for free and sell them on Craigslist afterwards. Just all kinds of stupid crap like that! And realizing that most of that is stupid! Because in a sense, when you have Bitcoin, which stores value really well, youre not going to go and buy needless crap, because if you just wait a little longer, youre gonna get something much better! And youre gonna get it for a much better price, because in terms of Bitcoin, those things are all going down in price. I would say the main way in which Bitcoins changed me is a part of coming into maturity, part of who Im becoming, and thats just having a lower time preference, thinking much more about the long term, and things like that.", "image": null}

I learn to be pretty introspective as a programmer, you have to analyze things. A lot of people dont believe me when I say this about being a programmer: its actually very emotional! Especially when a project youve been working on 24/7 for three months gets cut and then you have to come to terms with the fact that you worked on something that no ones gonna use or whatever. Or you work on something and a lot more people like it, even though it took you five minutes. Like that was a critical thing for them, or something like that! Theres a lot of  that internal, emotional management aspect of it is something I did have at least a little bit of through my experience in programming. But I would be lying if I said that I had really good self-control at the same place I am now, nine years ago. That just wasnt the case! The thing that changed with Bitcoin was that I started to recognize what it really meant to save. And what it really meant to be able to put off till later  you know, let some things go! Instead of wanting things Now now now. Ive always sort of been a little bit that way anyway, with the exception of a few things, but this really encouraged it and put the better angel of my nature in charge, rather than the devil of wanting things now. And I would say that those two worked in sync and Ive been able to save a lot more  recently  because of the things that developed as a result of being in Bitcoin.", "image": null}

Actually, my temper comes out sometimes! You could ask my kids or you could ask people on stream like I did last week on the election. There are times I just go off on people or whatever. But I would say that there is a sense in which Ive learned to moderate some of my emotions. But thats more a result of getting more attention on Twitter and so on, and less Bitcoin. Thats just something I learned as a result of  like, 2013, nobody knew who I was but I was on Twitter and I was Tweeting about Bitcoin. Id get like 3 likes and people would argue with me and I would get really angry and say nasty things! All kinds of stuff like that! In a sense, going through those early was a real blessing because I learned to recognize, Okay, most people wont change their mind on a public forum in any way, shape, or form. And second, you can let them win a little! Its okay! If somebody gets the last word in, let them get that little win, and youll be  its not gonna hurt you any. You may think it does, but it doesnt! Most people arent gonna see those comments, and the people that do are gonna think less of the people that made those comments than the response that you gave. I think that that definitely affected me more in that direction, although I dont rule out the possibility that Bitcoin has had something to do with that aspect as well. Certainly, having to speak a lot and talk on podcasts and things like that, I think for me were a bigger influence.", "image": null}

Thats something that  now that Im not beholden to a company  I really wish I did earlier! And it actually took me a while. I think it was middle of 2017 when I really decided, Okay, you know what? Im gonna go off on my own instead of working for a company. Even the four years from 20132017  I was working for Bitcoin companies  which is great, because I get to work on Bitcoin-related stuff, but it was not that satisfying because I wasnt working on what I wanted to, and it took me a month and a half of just getting up the gumption to go do it, to go off on my own and say, Alright, you know what? Im gonna give this thing a shot! And I might fall on my face, but Ill always have a programming career to go back to! Might as well give it a shot! As soon as I started it  and I found some success doing that  I was just like, Why didnt I do this ten years ago? Because I was just like  one of the things that I recognized was like, my opinions in large ways were beholden to my company! The company that I was working for! And in subtle ways, and in more overt ways, but my mind wasnt my own when I was working for them! The golden handcuffs of salary, they consume your soul in some ways! And the ability to detach from that, to have my own voice and to say whatever the hell I feel like. You know, just have my own thing going  that was enormously freeing! And youre probably right, that definitely had an effect on my perspective and maybe how I come across and things like that. You go to a conference and you listen to a speaker thats shilling their latest altcoin or whatever, and then you hear somebody like Tone Vays speak, its a completely different experience, because one is obviously working for somebody, and theyre being sycophants to whoever is giving them the money. But when you tell the truth with the conviction of real belief, it makes a big difference! And it comes across a different way! You have a different impact on people, and I think maybe thats the main thing that Ive gotten out of going off on my own into this Bitcoin entrepreneur journey.", "image": null}

I really want to touch on this: middle of 2017  my first question there is, How much do you think going from that beholden point where you work for someone else, to being your freer person. At that moment in time, does your voice get more clear and chiseled? Or are you literally just releasing thoughts that have been pent up? I think that theres like a fork in the road that you almost cant have certain thoughts until youve left those binds!", "image": null}

It really was kind of like that! Theres like a barrier, you cant express yourself fully because youre tied in golden handcuffs or something. You dont have that freedom of movement, the freedom of thought. And you could kind of see this in my writing too. In 2017  the first half of 2017I was trying to be conciliatory to all sides, trying to calm people down, try to thread the needle in between and say, Hey, you know what? Im this neutral person and everything else. And you can see in the second half of 2017 I started getting my own voice and saying  instead of writing what people wanted to hear, I started writing what I really thought! And that made all of the difference! People want to think what it is that you think for the reasons that you think it, instead of whatever the company line may be, or whatever might make them feel better. As much as people like things that make them feel better, it doesnt connect at a level that real truth does! So I think that was the main thing. It wasnt a lot of pent up stuff. I think to a degree, a large part of my  its kind of like water that youre swimming in, you dont really recognize that your opinions are beheld that way, and that youre being moderate because youre put into a political position at your workplace that you didnt sign up for but you nevertheless have to play. It wasnt like that as it was likebeing free from that  my mind could now go wherever it wanted! I have always thought of myself as somebody that sought truth, and thats where it led me. Thats ultimately I think what led me to write a lot of those things that I did. It seemed to connect really well with Bitcoin Twitter and so on.", "image": null}

The best thing that Ive come up with is just give them the tools to succeed, and then see what they want to do, and dont let fear get in the way of their trying things. Because to me, the hardest hurdle to overcomethe month and a half where I was pondering whether or not I should go off on my own  it was getting over that fear! It kind of sounds silly right now that it took me a month and a half to get over that fear, but thats what it took. Literally every night just thinking, Oh okay. If I do this, okay. And I made lists and said, Okay here are the pros, here are the cons, here is the worst case scenario, heres blah blah blah. And ultimately  at some point you have to move! You have to do something! You have to take a step! After I took that step it was like, What the hell was I worried about? Navigating the free market and finding a product that other people will find interesting and will pay for isnt this crazy difficult thing that they make it out to be! Ive been absolutely shocked at some of the things that Ive been able to sell to people, and oftentimes theyll come to me and ask me for it! And I was like, Hey, I didnt even know that this was something that youd want, but okay! Ive done it for you, now lets go do it for like 30 other people. And you make a bunch of money! In a sense, thats the mentality that I would love to instill in my kids and give them that sense that the worlds your oyster! Its not something to be afraid of, you just need to have certain skills to be able to navigate it. But you dont need to be beholden to a company because in many ways, that would probably be one of the worst outcomes that I could imagine. Which is that they go to a company and sort of live out their existence in quiet desperation to quote Thoreau. That would be the worst possibility for me! I would want them to live and take risks and break things and try something and fail! Thats when you actually learn things! And I gotta tell you! Ive failed in a bunch of things since the middle of 2017. Ive tried a bunch of things and was like, Yeah, thats not gonna work. I was able to fail quickly and learn from it. And other things it was like, Hey, this works! And it works for a certain amount of time. Thats what I would like to instill is: that sense of entrepreneurship, of risk-taking, of this mandate to actually add something to the world, not by doing what someone tells you but by using your own mind and creativity and skills to find some piece of the market that needs something that you can fulfill.", "image": null}

That to me is way more effective than learning a set skill. Like, programming is kind of a unique skill in that it can be fitted towards lots and lots of different things, but most jobs in the economy are not like that! Theyre very much cookie-cutter, and its like, Oh, we need an accountant, and we need a lawyer, and whatever. All of those things have very specific credentials around them and things like that. I get why they need to exist, but theyre not, at least for me, that creative, or that fulfilling. My kids might think differently! And Im open to seeing how they see the world! To a degree, to get the best match for your skills and passions and whatever makes money  to get the best fit for that, you need to go out into the market yourself and not go into a cookie-cutter role that they ask for in the marketplace.

They dont want to share what they were thinking when, and what they accomplished, and the sauce. And inspire others, maybe. You wrote, Back in May of 2017 I had just broken 1,000 followers on Twitter. Now you got something like over 180,000 followers on Twitter. And you outline here, Im gonna write some goals. And you wrote down some goals in 2017 when you had 1,000 followers. And you wrote down, I want to be a keynote to a conference, travel to five continents and do something Bitcoin related, create my own business and write a book, and you put it on a 5-year horizon which I think is fantastic!

And that was an absolute shocker to me! That I was able to do that in 18 months! And if you want some tips on goal setting, theres a really cool Jordan Peterson goal setting workshop that I use to actually set those goals. And basically he just asks you a bunch of questions and you answer them as honestly as possible, and thats how I came up with those goals. And yeah, did I think I would achieve them in 18 months? Absolutely not! Did I even think that I was going to be able to achieve them in 5 years? Absolutely not! But it came in large part because goals have that effect where, you notice opportunities that fit your goals because you have them. Because youre focused on the endpoint, youre able to see how opportunities that you might have now can fit towards those goals! And I think thats definitely what happened! About two months after that I went off on my own and started my own business teaching programmers, and a couple months after this I got invited to my first conference and lo and behold they wanted me to keynote the first day! I was the very first speaker on the first day of that conference. And it was a brand new conference, I was like, I havent really spoken before but okay! Alright, this is what I wanted! So I ended up doing that. A month after that a friend of mine approached me about writing a book together, and then we explored things, and he wanted to drop out so it ended up being me, and I ended up getting a contract with OReilly to write a book. Not The Little Bitcoin book, but the Programming Bitcoin book. That ended up happening. You know, and I got invited to different conferences and I was like, Okay, lets see where it is. And it ended up that I did travel to five continents! All of those things happened because I was looking for those opportunities and I had some goals in mind! I think goal setting is absolutely crucial if you want to get some things done. I have different goals now. Well see how those come to pass! But yeah, Im a big believer in how much the goals actually focus you towards them. And they almost call out to you and draw you to them like magnets.

Its okay to want those things! If youre honest about it thats okay! The thing Ive found is that oftentimes your perspective on those very things changes as you go closer towards them and you might not want them anymore! You mentioned your son wants to be a YouTube influencer showing people how to plan video games and so on, because thats what hes watching right now. I bet you after he finds out what their lives are really like in a few years, his perspective will change. And hell say, You know what Dad? Maybe thats not for me! You have to play video games like 14 hours a day to get really good at it in order to be able to show it, and you have to have really good video skills and speaking skills and I tried public speaking and Im not very good at it, blah blah blah. So theres a lot of those kinds of things that can correct your path, and you might not want those things anymore, at which point, you can reset your goals. I feel like when I set those goals I was old enough at least know myself enough to know that those were within reach within five years. Those were things that I could do that were concrete, that werent abstract, not knowing ever whether I ever actually reached those goals or not. The actual desire is okay to have. Thats something that you kind of have to give yourself permission to have, and say, Alright, its okay for me to want this in five years. I might change  you always leave yourself the out that, Hey, thats not what I want, and Im okay with not achieving that particular goal and I can go do something else. I guess that has to do with something like your perception of yourself versus who you really are, because a lot of people want to be somebody that theyre not! Or they perceive themselves to be somebody that theyre not! And being honest with yourself is hard for that reason. This is where having a spouse can be really, really helpful! It certainly was for me! Having her tell me her perspective of me definitely changed my perspective of me, and that helped me to set clear goals and be more honest with myself.", "image": null}

But I did these seminars in two days, and it was eight hours a day, two days. These people are paying me a lot of money and so theyre very motivated to learn. And amazingly, they got almost all of it in two days! Which was amazing to me that they could! But thats the power of human effort, and thats the power of desire and things like that! And I look at the education system today and Im like, This is completely broken! Because if these people can learn in two days what took me really like a couple of years  the education system is what is wrong! Theyre not properly motivated, or its not presented the right way, or whatever. Theres plenty of really smart people that can get things really, really quickly! And Im sure you know of coding boot camps and things like that? Its six weeks and then they come out of it paid six-figures at a pretty decent company. Thats the path that theyre on, and six weeks of training is all that they need to get to that point where they can do something like that! Thats the first thing that I learned, is that people are very willing to learn if they are motivated to do so! The other thing that I learned is that theres a lot of people that get motivated by other people. I have pretty much the same material in my book, and you can definitely work through it. The typical length of time it takes for somebody to actually work through the entire book with all of the exercises and everything is a few months. But Im able to do this in two days! Part of it is me pushing them. Just, Im gonna go fast and you better keep up, otherwise youre not gonna get value out of it. But the other part of it is that, theres sort of like what I would call the CrossFit effect  if youve ever been in CrossFit, just the fact that somebody next to you is doing reps that youre not doing makes you feel terrible! And that motivates you to do the reps, even if you dont feel like it! And thats the dynamic in a classroom that I realized really works in everyones favor. When you have competition and this sense of keeping up, it can be a very powerful force for learning. So those would be the two things that Id say I learned about.", "image": null}

Alright, Ill teach them, and then they went back. I also had a bunch of Bitcoin HODLers that knew a little bit about programming that wanted to learn more about the protocol so they could learn more about their investment. I had college students, and I had octogenarians! I had people all over the spectrum. I actually had a few high school students. In fact, I had a 14-year-old girl that won a scholarship  so pretty smart girl  that managed to take the course and keep up with the rest of the class, which absolutely shocked me! It was a whole variety of people and they all had different motivations. This was something thatas a small business person you realize  is that, the markets gonna come from places to you do not expect.

Do you ever pick up something very quickly about students as youre teaching them. You maybe sense whos picking it up or whos getting it? And this question is kind of phrased in two ways: how much of coding  whether someones in your course  how much of it is art versus science? Or a combination, and some people are better at one or the other? Like I could write code and get what you need done, versus maybe Satoshi  and Im trying to paraphrase what you wrote  wasnt the best coder ever?

Once in a while youll just see a student thats asking these very precise questions, and youre like, Okay! That person is going places! If theyre asking that, that means they know all of this other stuff. And they have a grasp of it thats even better than mine. Theres certainly those one-off geniuses that you encounter in class  every educator has met them! And you can always tell, usually by the quality of the question. But there are also others that are more silent and introverted and they get it, but you never identify it until much later. And that I usually find out by what happens afterwards! What companies they get hired by and so on. I think I have students at pretty much every major Bitcoin company that exists! Like, they clearly know something and can do things that I didnt identify while I was teaching them. There is a lot of that. I would say that the creativity, the art of it, comes from understanding. I think Satoshi could have written a better client, if Satoshi had more programming experience. But the fact that Satoshi got so much of it right is actually more impressive than the parts that he got wrong, because those are sort of the mistakes that you would expect somebody that wasnt quite as familiar with what you would call enterprise-grade coding, or open source level coding, that you expect from the bigger projects and so on. So I think theyre both very related. Its great to see  I dont know, I call them my kids too  when your kids do something really cool.", "image": null}

But definitely theres something about that disappearance that was purposeful, that actually ended up changing the ecosystem quite a bit, because it decentralized it from Satoshi. Satoshi was no longer the point person to make all the decisions. Instead, it became a decentralized project. Nothing else comes close to doing anything like that! And that was a key thing, I think. And anyone thats observed this space kind of knows what that really means  its that, this is not a normal person that would do something like that, because it takes a lot of selflessness. None of those coins have moved, and theres a lot of them, and we know that Satoshi was a cypherpunk, so theres little to no chance that those keys arent backed up, but theres a significant amount of virtue inherent in Satoshi to be able to do that! Some people say like, Ah! He got arrested! Now hes sitting in prison and thats why it happened.", "image": null}

They instead came in thinking, Oh this is a good investment! I picked the winner! Im going to be able to pick other winners. They get kind of an ego about it. And I think thats where their downfall is, in thinking that they are bigger than Bitcoin itself. Weve seen this happen over and over and over again with all of these would-be saviors that are creating their own coin and saying, This is the new thing. Were going to be Facebook to Bitcoins Myspace. Bitcoin is the Model T and Im a Lambroghini. These are all arguments by analogy and so on. Ultimately, they believe that they can do better than Satoshi did. And thats the fatal flaw to a large degree. Because the biggest thing that Satoshi did was leave! And give up the throne, if you will. And thats something these guys arent willing to do. In that sense its a sad commentary on their motivations. They end up there because  if youre an investor and you make a lot of money, youre going to have an ego. Thats just a fact. Thats how you keep score in that world. For a technical person its not quite like that. You keep score a different way so youre not as susceptible to that particular thing, so I suspect thats why programmers havent been as susceptible to that as non-technical OGs have.", "image": null}

I would say the halving was the big event that happened in May, and that was something that everyone anticipated, but the supply shock that came as a result of that hasnt really worked itself through the market, until about now. Its starting to be felt. You can see the price rising and so on. Thats definitely something thats happening. Will it continue down this road and will it end Im not really sure.

And Taproot looks like it wont be activated until next year so I was wrong about that. I expected it to be activated this year which it definitely wont be. 2021 Im expecting Taproot to get activated. I suspect that wallets will have a little bit of a hard time implementing all of the goodies that come out of Taproot: Schnorr signatures, aggregated multisig, MuSig and things like that. Those are not that simple, lets just say that from a technical standpoint. And theres lot of gotchas, a lot of wallet developers  they do put in a lot of time into their product, but theyre also putting a lot of time into altcoins and things like that. If you want to adopt Schnorr and things, youre going to really need to focus on Schnorr and not be developing altcoin number 95 or whatever into your product. I see some tension around wallets and Schnorr and adoption and things like that. I think the industry will be adopting it, its just a matter of time. Other things: I see the uncertainty continuing from 2020. I know thats probably not what a lot of people want to hear. That seems to be the case right now. There is a lot of uncertainty around elections and COVID and things like that. If anything, this seems to be  I hate this phrase  but the new normal.

The social impact of whats happened is something thats going to be felt for a pretty long time. And a lot of its going to be permanent, because Google, Twitter, Facebook, theyre all like letting their employees work remotely for at least a year and so on. Thats definitely going to become more normal. Theres probably a lot of other things happening, and who knows what other virus might spark the public imagination in the next 18 months.

Its also a culture of more free and libertarian thinking, which I like. Which is very different than the coasts which tend to be a lot more nanny statish. I rather have my freedom. Its a very good cost of living versus what you can make ratio, which is kind of what you want! In San Francisco, you can make a lot of money, but it also costs you an arm and a leg to live there.

And I knew about Bitcoin essentially 2011, and I read a little bit about it, and I certainly didnt grok it, but I did kind of understand that it was this anonymous Internet money. And that people were using it to buy drugs and stuff. It was interesting! But I didnt quite get it. And then, somewhere around 20132014 I was like, People are still buying drugs on the Internet with this stuff! And I tried to go on Mt. Gox and I got into the log-in, and I started to create an account, and they asked for my ID, and I was like, Oh, I thought this was an anonymous Internet currency? So I was like, Well this wont do! So I closed that window, did a little more research, and was like, Oh! An ATM! As long as it doesnt have a camera, I can obscure my face and I can get some anonymous Internet money! Thats cool! So I just kind of waited, and I always looked around for them, but I guess I kind of forgot about it for a few years. Id see it come up on TV and stuff, and then 2017  big price, the hype, right?  I was like, You know what? Im gonna take another look at this. And like many among us, I fell into the Andreas Antonopoulos rabbit hole videos, and started going pretty deep. I watched probably like a hundred of those. And then I was just like looking around for more information, I was on Reddit a bunch, and eventually I saw that you gotta get on Twitter, if youre gonna be in the Bitcoin universe!

But there was this really intelligent guy who, hes just like in the finance world in the U.K. or something, and he kept going back to this deflationary argument. And I realized I didnt understand enough about the economics, and that was just about the time I was getting onto Twitter, and eventually found people like Pierre Rochard, and kept hearing about Austrian economics. I think I followed Justin Moon, he runs BUIDL Bootcamp. He teaches people how to code Bitcoin, so he put this thing out saying, Im doing an Austrian economics book club  whos in? I was just like, Oh, sure! Me! Then I met Max Hillebrand, whos amazing. I met Zane Pocock, whos really awesome if you guys dont know Zane, and I met Thibaud Marchal. Almost every week, we discuss Austrian economics in the paradigm of the Bitcoin world, and my knowledge has just skyrocketed.", "image": null}

I was on, I think it was Reddit, and as much shit as I give Reddit, I have learned a lot from Reddit over the years, and I hate Reddit and I dont go on it these days. And I think I remember coming across a post, and it was basically like, How do I sort through all this noise? There is so much noise in crypto! This was like, early 2017, late 2016, like height of the frenzy, and somebody asked the question and was like How do I sort through all this noise? Somebody was like, Alright. What you need to do is you need to make a Twitter  and I already had a Twitter but I had only used it for like trading penny stocks, just to follow companies and P/Es and stuff  he said, Follow the people that have been in this space a really long time, cultivate a really careful Twitter feed of people that are either developers, that have been in this space a really long time and are smart and only talk about smart stuff, and then he had a list of all of his recommended people, and a lot of them were people I still follow today like Kyle Torpey, Pierre Rochard  some of them I have ended up muting, blocking, whatever. Guys like Vinny Lingham, like  get him away from me! But, yeah I had a really similar journey! And Twitter, for me, was a huge part in shaping my understanding and my thought process, and finding my gaps in my knowledge. You know what I mean?", "image": null}

And I think this brings me to: I think one of the most important things you need to understand about this universe is that critical thinking is so paramount! Especially in the fake news era, but it always is. So if you guys arent familiar with critical thinking, its a very simple discipline that is quintessential to incorporating new information into your worldview. And it talks about (1) avoiding logical fallacies. So, in order to do that you need to understand logic and you need to understand what logical fallacies are and how they lead you to the incorrect conclusions and think youre correct. (2) Second thing is, absorb information from many different sources, and decide based on the validity of the arguments therein, whether or not this information is good. You may not know whether its true or not, but how good is it? And you incorporate lots of information and they all kind of have a scale of how good they are. And on Twitter, youre not getting information from CNN or FOX News, its from all these random people, and you just have to evaluate the information based on what it is. [09:18] In doing that, thats how you cultivate your Twitter following, like you said. You followed people, and then you unfollowed them when you realized that what they were saying wasnt prescient, or wasnt logically sound. And if you work from this foundation, then you can get to a place thats close to truth  and I use that word very loosely.", "image": null}

But thats inherently impossible! Because everybodys biased in some way, shape, or form. And just because a person is biased, doesnt mean that theyre wrong! Somebody can be extremely  me, for example, Im probably very biased for Bitcoin. But thats also because Ive done probably, at this point, hundreds if not a thousand-plus hours of research on this topic. And I am thoroughly and logically convinced through my steps through this process, through this Bitcoin spectrum  as were gonna go over and talk about today  that Ive come to the correct conclusions, or at least Ive surrounded myself with enough smart people that they would weed out my bullshit. You know, where I would be wrong. Like, Twitter is such an amazing resource. If you cultivate, carefully, a good following, and you block people liberally who interrupt your intellectual process, it can be a really, really great place to learn! So, I want to jump into this Bitcoin spectrum. Now, this is something that you share with me  this was published by Unchained Capital, Im gonna have a link to this picture down in the show notes if you guys want to check it out, if you want to follow along visually if youre a visual learner (I dont know why youre listening to a podcast, but). If you want to follow along as we talk through this, but we want to try to hit some of the major points, because something Ben and I talked a lot about is how the Bitcoin and the blockchain spectrum is massive in scope, and if you have missing pieces, its kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, right? If you have missing pieces on this Bitcoin spectrum, youre not gonna be able to see the whole picture, and youre really not going to be able to understand why this thing is so important, and why its so valuable, unless you can see the big picture!

So the spectrum  in case people arent looking at the thing  its four main pillars. And I dont think this graph is necessarily the end-all. Its a Venn-diagram, right? It has four main pillars, four main schools of thought, and I dont think this is the end-all, be-all of what describes Bitcoin, but its a great start to understand how complex this topic is. There are four main bubbles on this Venn-diagram: Politics, Economics, Distributed Systems, Cryptography. Really, each one of these things are very difficult to understand wholisticly  really understand them. And what were trying to do, to understand Bitcoin, is to understand all four of these things and how they interact. And then, try to understand the paradigm of a new world with Bitcoin in it! And then understand all of those disciplines in this new paradigm, this unknown future that is in front of us. And that is a very difficult task to do I think.

Its important to try to take a very praxeological approach to this spectrum in understanding that there arent really any hard and fast rules here. All we can really do is observe human action, try to anticipate the way that we think this is gonna play out, and thats where the whole game theory thing comes into it. And look at each spectrum as broadly as possible, and then dig as deeply into Bitcoin as we can, and try to understand where we think this thing is gonna go! And I think that thats what a lot of really smart people have done. And yeah, Ben, you and I have been talking about this just the other day, I feel like the smartest people in cryptocurrency  and if youre listening to this and youre not that into Bitcoin, you know, welcome to the show  but, Im sorry its just the honest truth!

I will come to a thought independently, post it on Twitter and see somebody else later that had already wrote it!

And one of those conclusions  the Schelling point, as Marty Bent talks about  is Bitcoin itself being really, really, a whole lot farther ahead than all the other ones. Really has a much better chance of doing what were talking about. Where its taking over a large swathe of the money that we transact on the Internet.", "image": null}

In case you guys missed it, the four pillars are Politics, Economics, Distributed Systems, and Cryptography. So were gonna start, and were gonna talk about the economics first.

So first and foremost we have the economics piece. Ben, what are your initial thoughts when you think of the economics?", "image": null}

Well, I got into it because I was trying to argue with people and I realized that I didnt have the knowledge. I didnt understand inflationary versus deflationary. And thats really a small piece of this, once you start getting deep into this! I think Hazlitt and Bastiat  Henry Hazlitts the one who wrote Economics In One Lesson  incredible read, talks about a fallacy, right? So I was talking about logical fallacies before. He talks about the fallacy of the broken window. [15:32] So really simply, if youre not familiar with it, its the idea that somebody has a shop. And the window gets broken in the shop, and that this creates economic activity and its good for the economy, because the guy comes and sweeps up the street and he gets paid, and the glazier  the guy who makes glass  has to create a glass window, and the people who supply him with glass stock, and the people who supply him with tools to do all that, all get economic transactions out of this! So youve created economy activity! But the fallacy is that: well, yeah, but the shop owner has to take money that he could have spent elsewhere. He could have spent it on a new pair of shoes, and  you never see those things, right? So this is the effects of that shop owner not being able to spend money on his new pair of shoes or his new suit or something  [they] are never seen, and theyre obscured, and theyre ignored. This happens everywhere in the economy, and if you have the government saying, Oh, well were gonna build this thing! And, Yes, that creates economic activity, but this is like a zero-sum game, essentially. That, if you create money to pay for something, then you have diluted the supply of all the money, and youve taken away purchasing power from everybody, and the investments that never happened, or the things that we couldnt buy because our money was worth a little bit less, are never seen. So this is a really crucial thing to understand, I think! I can keep going here, economics is so deep into this, right? Because money itself and commerce are so tied into economics, and were talking about a digital money that is brand new, so you have to understand money! I dont think anybody really understands money!", "image": null}

Thats actually a really great point if I could stop you for a second! I know for me personally, and I went to public school  I know Bens situation is a little bit different, but, growing up I took several economics courses, probably in high school and then maybe in my undergrad also, and I had never been exposed  you know, I had heard the name F. A. Hayek, but probably in name only in mentions like in passing them off, in the same way that you would read a psychology textbook and read about Freud and be like, That guy with those crazy theories that we dont really believe anymore. Thats the way that Austrian economics is presented to the modern scholar. And Im sorry (I keep saying sorry. Im not sorry) well bring it back to the critical thinking piece from earlieryou have to examine these things for yourself! And decide whether or not theyre worthy of value. And if you havent been exposed to Austrian economics then you are not in a position to decide whether or not thats a valid argument to be made, whether or not thats a valid theory! So if youre listening to this and you think, Oh, Austrian economics is bunk! Its been bunk for years and years and years ever since modern money theory! Ever since Keynesian economics! You need to revisit that. You need to go and learn a lot more about money! Where is it? Where does it come from?", "image": null}

That youre required to fall into this network of fallacies in order to understand Keynesianism. So essentially, what Im trying to say really, really convolutedly, is that: Austrian economics breaks the fallacies that are the arguments that Keynesianism makes. And Keynesianism is the main school of thought in economics! Essentially, that governments should interfere in markets. And really, Austrian economics is really just exposing the fallacies therein! And thats why we dont even really spend time [on it] because Keynesianism is just a bunch of equations and trying to manipulate the markets to your whim. And the thing you realize about markets and supply and demand is that the more you manipulate them the more they push back! But I really want to get into this forgotten history of money. If you dont understand the history of money, or what money is, or what problem it solves, how could you understand whether or not Bitcoin is money, or is good money, or is bad money? Its really not possible, and its really enlightening, and that goes into  if you guys havent read The Bitcoin Standard  incredible book that talks about the history of money and how so many great societies fell because of poor money. And a lot of it had to do with inflation. And inflation comes in many forms, but many years ago when there were gold coins or other metals used, they used debasement to inflate the currency. Which meant that they would take all the coins back, or they would collect some of them, and they would return coins out into circulation that had less of that metal in them. That was very laborious to do, it took a lot of work, you had to create all these new coins  it still had issues, and it was easy to verify! Like if you take this thing and melt it down and you find out theres less gold in it, then you could find out that the government was debasing your currency! And inflation happened much less than it happened now back then. For these reasons, because it was so hard to do.", "image": null}

[In] a keystroke, they can create new digital entries at the Federal Reserve, and create new money! And thats what they did in 2008 when they created many trillions of dollars. Since then, another $10 trillion has been added to the money supply  its insane! And this is all because its now easier to inflate, and its impossible to verify whether or not theyre inflating or not! They can just print and print and print!

And we could go really deep on this. We could talk about this for hours and hours and hours, and many people have! And theres still a lot more to unpack. We still havent yet fully begun to understand the economic implications of Bitcoin, because its the first time that weve ever really been able to push back on the free market, on this ideology, because it affords so much power to the centralized authorities: the ability to create credit and to harvest wealth through seigniorage rights. It is what has financed the world wars that we saw in the previous century. And it was unprecedented prior to that, when, in Democracy: The God That Failed, Hans Herman Hoppe, talks about how, back when private property was the normwhen that was just the expectation across the board  and kings had to represent their own private best interests by engaging in armed conflict, they couldnt afford to indebt themselves indefinitely in order to fight these extremely large, expense, bloody battles, because it was impossible!

Anytime youre going through this Bitcoin spectrum here, or if youre just reading posts on Twitter and youre just trying to learn more about Bitcoin, anytime you come across any concept that you dont understand, or even if youre not 100% clear of what that is, you should take that as a learning opportunity. And you should go and you should educate yourself on that matter. Most of the time its just a Google search away. Like if you dont know what Supply and Demand actually means, if youve heard that in school and you dont remember what it mean, type it into Google, go to Investopedia or whatever, and just look it up! And now youre clear, because I think I see a lot of people do this, where theyre participating in an argument and they dont understand whats even being discussed. But theyre still arguing, even though they dont understand the concepts that are being discussed? And that really makes you look like a fool. So dont be a fool. Make sure that you understand these concepts, and if you dont understand something, jump into it. But, anyway, its not just the economics piece. Economics sort of has an overlap with politics. Its not enough to know about just sound money, and about supply and demand, and about scarcity. Youve also got markets. You have to understand the way markets work, regulation, monetary policy, global banking, national security. Ben you want to touch on any of those?", "image": null}

I think this one, its tough to talk about on its own, because I plan to show how these things overlap. But democracies and communities are on the politics spectrum. Democracy has been kind of  started to be infected through socialism. And a lot of people today throw that word around without really understanding what it means. Socialism is, by a simple definition, government owning the means of production. But I came across a Tweet recently that said, Japans central bank has become a top 10 shareholder in 50% of the companies there. So what do I mean by that? I mean that literally the central bank has bought stocks from all of these companies. A top 10 shareholder in 50% of the companies in Japan! And its a similar story here! I dont know the numbers on here, but the government, in open market operations, is buying stocks to support asset prices. This is what happened in 2008. Theyre also, through their policy, through low interest rates, theyre throwing money on assets, but  well get into that in a second I think, but ", "image": null}

The Swiss national bank ownssomething like 10% of their balance sheet is international equity, and I believe half of that is actually US equity.

And really the free market is dying! And people are point to now capitalism and saying, Oh, capitalism isnt working! Well, its not capitalism when the government is literally manipulating all of the markets! Price signals are developed  so you can see how these things are overlapping, I cant even talk about politics without talking about economics, but free markets are the idea that, you know, I put up a good at whatever price that it took me to produce it plus a little bit of premium from my work that Ive put into it, and when the government is changing the value of the money by diluting the supply and, in many other ways, manipulating these markets  and by the way, theyre doing this openly and saying that this is the Federal policies!

And were not just making this stuff up. You know, theres already historical precedent for this. Just 2008 is actually a great example. You see the real estate bubble, and most people dont understand why it happened. They think that it was because the average investor thought that they could get rich quick, and that they were going out and taking out too many mortgages, and yeah, thats part of the problem, but the real problem was that credit was so easy to get, and there was so much incentivebecause of all the mortage-backed securities, no risk, and money that was being funneled into Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac  and this was all through the government, right? And this disrupts the normal actions of the free market. Normally, you have the benefits, and then you have the fall backs. You get to reap the rewards, but you also have to deal with the risks, deal with the fallout afterwards.

And thats exactly what I was just talking about with the risks. So the banks dont take on any risk! Because if they fail, the lender of last resort steps in. And thats what happened. There was this implicit guarantee that the government will bail out the banks, and it did happen in 2008, and millions and millions of Americans lost unknowable wealth through the real estate bubble bursting. And this brings me to another point, is that in understanding money Ive realized that, you know  what do the wealthy hold? Do they hold a savings account with a whole $10 billion? No! Absolutely not! They hold assets, which are like stocks and real estate. And were talking about government policies that literally support the prices of these things: low interest rates and open market operations keep piling money on the stock market and real estate. And on top of this  so, money devalues over time. [33:21] So people dont hold their wealth in money! Everybody knows that just keeping a savings account means that youre losing 2%-3% per year, compounded every year. So youre losing half your wealth every 1520 years! It just disappears, in money! So people hold their wealth in assets. And the assets inflate, right? So theyre getting return in that. And the poor people cannot hold assets. I mean, think of somebody working at McDonalds living paycheck to paycheck  they cant hold stocks or real estate as their wealth, so they lose more to inflation than rich people. Rich people dont really lose anything to inflation, because they hold such a small amount of cash, they hold equities, and they hold real estate, and they hold positions in businesses. I have another chart on this that I just Tweeted. Its just mind-blowing that, even the middle class have access to certain assets. But the richer you are, the more access you have to assets that go up even farther over time! Thats the slavery thats happening right now! Thats why everyones pissed off!

Or even to write a new transaction, or to double-spend. And this gets me into why Bitcoin is better than all the other cryptocurrencies  probably combined! Because it has ten times the users and ten times the hashrate of all these things combined! You could turn off 10% of the supply of Bitcoin miners and point them at Bitcoin Cash, for example, and 51% attack it with ease! And one of these large Bitcoin mining pools could probably do that with ease, right now, and then go back to mining Bitcoin afterward! They could crash Bitcoin Cash if they really wanted to! Thats not possible with Bitcoin. So you see a lot of Bitcoin maximalists very ardent that Bitcoin is way, way better. You have to understand all of these things together, and then you have to start to understand the economics and networks. So Metcalfes law, network effects, and how much larger the network of Bitcoin is, and how much more people know about Bitcoin and use Bitcoin. And where its accepted, if you want to go that route. How much further ahead it is. I also wanted to get into how cryptography and distributed systems  specifically BitTorrent. If you guys dont remember, in the 90s there was Napster. Napster was where you could download songs for free. I remember showing this to my friends and they were like, Wow! You can download any song for free? And I was like, Yep! Right there! Check it out! And it was shut down. And then there was Morpheus and Limewire and all these other services came out after it and those were all shut down too. [39:17] And then somebody came along and made this thing called BitTorrent. And the governments were like, Huh! Theres really no way to shut this down! Its a peer to peer network! Youd have to go down to every single persons house and shut them all off. And BitTorrent opened the door to a system that could never be turned off. And that kind of goes into the decentralization of Bitcoin, why decentralization is so important, and why Bitcoiners are small blockers, versus the big block Bitcoin Cash people. The decentralization of the network is paramount! Its the most important thing! If you do not have this decentralization, it will get shut down! We know, because all of the other sovereign monies that were tried outside of the government all got shut down. From Liberty Dollar to real meatspace stuff to BCash and BitGold. There was a number of digital currencies started and eventually the government just shows up and knocks on the door and says, Yeah you guys gotta turn this stuff of. The decentralization of Bitcoin, plus solving the double-spend problem, is what makes it resilient to this. Its antifragility. And if you dont understand that concept youre not gonna understand why Bitcoiners think that its better than all the other cryptocurrencies. And while were on distributed systems and open source software, you get into network architecture. The network architecture of the Internet is built with Internet Protocol first, then its TCP/IP, and then later they built all these other layers on top of that: HTTPS  and those things dont change, right? So IP, TCP  were not changing those protocols. Another good example is e-mail, the POP and IMAP, havent changed in 20 or 30 years! You know, theres no read receipts, theres no undo button, and theres a number of features that we could add if we could change the protocols underlying these things, but they dont change. And theres a reason these things dont change  its because these things are being built in layers. And understanding why the Lightning Network developed the way it did  you have to crucially understand these concepts first, right? I think thats mainly covering most of these giant things. If you want we can go into how some of these overlap, but we already kind of started that. What do you think, Collin?", "image": null}

Well, Ill touch on some of the things that you just mentioned. You were talking about how, a lot of people, they see the Bitcoiners ardently proclaiming that Bitcoin is so objectively more secure than any other project. And the layman hears that and says, This guy! This guy is trying to pump his bags! He cares more about his  hes selfish! He wants Bitcoin to win and he wants everyone else to lose! But the real objective truth is that were talking orders of magnitude, the levels of security that Bitcoin has relative to everything else, and I would even argue  first of all, I think that proof of stake is stupid, but thats a rabbit hole were not gonna go down right now. I would argue that minority proof of work chains, meaning any proof of work coin that isnt Bitcoin, is at a severe severe severe security disadvantage, for the reason that Ben talked about earlier, is that you can just take a small fraction of the hashpower from the Bitcoin network  leaving Bitcoins security completely unchanged  and you can attack a minority chain with that. And you can affect a lot of people that are using that chain that way. And the Bitcoins main security isnt even touched! So when people say, when youre on Twitter, you see people saying, Oh! Bitcoin is the only secure cryptocurrency. Theres a reason that theyre saying it! Theyre not talking under their butt, theyre not trying to pump their bags ", "image": null}

And many economistsusually proponents of the free markets  stop short at money. They insist that money should be regulated by the government and issued by the government. But it didnt used to be. It used to be gold! We essentially, by confiscating gold and making it illegal to hold gold, we took the free market out of money completely! And weve replaced it with these pieces of paper that allow us to create money with a keystroke. And [theyve] powerfully and subtly acquired the stored time of people  Misir Mahmudov talks about money as a stored time. You go work a bunch, and then later in life you redeem those tokens that youve received. But if those tokens can be diluted, theyre diluting your time! I had a friend who came to me and he was saying, If somebody wastes some of your time, they are murdering part of your life. Theyre actually taking part of your life away. Right? So if you go watch a 30-second ad, for example  and he started doing all the math and the average lifespan is 80 years or something, and he said  A minute of your time is a micromurder! Because he calculated how much time you have in your life, and if you waste one day of it, then its one millionth of that or something. And I turned to him and I said, Well yeah, but you store your time in money! So if the government is diluting the supply of money, that means theyre murdering you at 3% per year! And he goes, Oh. Thats a really good point. [50:24] Legal tender laws are tied into this confiscation of gold thing, right?

And I would add, the reason this happens is because of something called Greshams Law, which is where a good money will be hoarded, and bad money will be circulated. Meaning that, people  like, the free market knows whats good money and whats bad money. And thats why, in these systems where we had gold notes and gold in the banks, youd see people spending the bad money, and hoarding  you know, anytime they could get a hold of gold or silver coins, theyd take it home and theyd put it in the dresser drawer, or theyd store it in a bank deposit box. Because even if they dont consciously realize it, they know that that holds its value, and that the paper gets diluted over time and it loses its value, and thats where these legal tender laws come from: is the government has to force people to use the paper that their brains tell them, No! Thats not as good as the gold! Because its not as hard of a value. The legal tender laws force you! You have to pay your taxes, you have to accept this if you own a store. You have to use this if you want somebody to buy your house.

Again you have to understand why we use paper money in the first place. We started to use paper certificates of gold. They were stand-ins, where the gold was kept in vaults. And you get to the centralization of gold in vaults problem: the person that holds all the gold, really, is the person who holds all the money, not the people that hold the paper. Because you have to actually get the gold. If the paper is inflated too much, well then youre gonna want the gold back, but its all held in banks and the governments confiscated it all. Oh and you talked about Greshams Law, but I never talk about Greshams Law without talking about Thiers Law, which is like the reciprocal of it! So you talked about: bad money drives out good money, meaning that people hoard the good money, and the spend the bad money, so all the bad money is being spent in the economy. But Thiers Law is when good money drives out bad money. Meaning that, once the purchasing power of the bad money gets so bad, people no longer want it at all.

And gold! It has verifiable purity. It goes back to the verifiability of cryptography and math. So when you tested gold, to make sure that it was good gold, you had to melt it down or weigh it, you had to do all this stuff in order to make sure its the right density, that it is actually gold. Well, Bitcoin is not only trivial to verify  like, how much digital gold somebody just gave you? You can actually melt down the entire supply of Bitcoin every ten minutes using your full node. So you can trivially verify all of the Bitcoin, you can melt down the entire supply all at once. It also cannot be inflated. The reason it cannot be inflated is the immutability of this very large decentralized network that is based on mathematical security that there will never be more than 21 million. Bitcoin will never be suppressed because of the BitTorrent thing. They made Napster, then Limewire, then Morpheus, but they couldnt shut down BitTorrent! And they still havent, much to their dismay. Bitcoin cannot be turned off! And it cant really be suppressed. In Venezuela, theyre trying to suppress Bitcoin, theyre knocking on miners doors and confiscating mining equipment in Venezuela. But you can send a packet anywhere in the world very easily by connecting to any network. And in the future mesh networking will become even more prolific.

We started off not having any money and just bartering and eventually people realized that everybody liked wheat, for example, and everybody used wheat as money because it was widely used. And then they went on and used shells and glass beads and stones  and all of these things got inflated. So inflation was really the problem with most monies. [57:55] [For] some of them durability was a problem. And eventually gold took over all money because it was the best money, not because a government enforced gold. It means that individually, separately, just like us Bitcoiners individually coming to the same conclusions, the markets across the world, individually, separate from each other, zeroed in on gold. And the reason that they zeroed in on gold was mostly because it was very difficult to inflate. It grew this very large stockpile, and then the flow of new gold coming in was so insignificant that you werent diluting your supply of your stored time energy with your gold. But gold had a really big issue with it. It wasnt portable, and it wasnt divisible to the needs of the modern world. If I wanted to transact with somebody in Sweden or in Japan, well I have to mail them a bunch of gold, and thats why they started using money certificates that were stand-ins for the gold that could be easily moved around and they made it divisible and all this stuff. But it led to the centralization of gold in vaults and it gave governments all this undue power to manipulate the supply of money because we eventually got off of certificates and we got onto pure fiat money and all these other problems. But Bitcoin is a 10x improvement on gold, because A) it solves the portability issue. Obviously, its digital information content type, we can move it around in ways that we cant even imagine yet! You know, the Lightning Network is talking about streaming money  these concepts that are still so foreign to us. B) Its censorship-resistant, meaning that nobody can stop you from using it. C) The innovation on Bitcoin. You dont need to go to a central bank and get permission from them. You dont need to go to the government to get permission from them. You dont need to go to Paypal and get permission to innovate and create new tools like streaming money or whatever. D) Access to it is access to anybody that has access to the Internet. A $20 cell phone as Andreas says, in Sudan, using a solar charger, can access this stuff.

F) The verifiability, etc. All of this stuff is the improvement that Bitcoin is on gold and why we think Bitcoin will just start seeping into every place where it is better money than these other things. And I think the biggest challenge to Bitcoin right now is its biggest boon, which is the volatility.

But understanding why something is volatile is crucial, right? This goes back to understanding that the reason its volatile is because, well, its inflation rate is higher than all the other monies, but thats changing with the halving schedule. So you have to understand the halving schedule. And then you have to understand liquidity, right? Which is like this already strange, anomalous concept, of liquidity! But it essentially means how salable over time this thing is, and how much is stored in it. We talk about the market cap of the stock market and how much US dollars is it. Trillions of US dollars and we use dollars as the unit of account. The liquidity of the Bitcoin network is like $90 billion today. And that, in relation to all of these other gigantic currencies in the hundreds of trillions each, its just a drop in the bucket! It can get swayed around. But understanding why the price keeps rising really is tied into this halving schedule. People adopting it and it acquiring a monetary premium. You know monetary premium, Collin?", "image": null}

And you see a lot of people, particularly the people that are newer to crypto, or have really just got Bitcoin and they want to get more people into it, and they ask the question, Whats a good, simple, 5 minute explanation that I can use to make somebody understand Bitcoin and blockchain completely? And I think that weve kind of demonstrated here by going through the spectrum, that there really isnt an answer to that question! People say, Well, youll never be able to get my grandma to understand this thing!

Essentially, its funny because, you know, I spent so much time trying to tell people about Bitcoin, and some of them listened, and some of them dont, and some of them even have acquired some. But I think that everybody in the world is incentivized. Theyre game theoretically incentivized to acquire some of this, actually! And theyre gonna buy some for the same reason I did. I told you this story, I knew about this a long time ago, but I only bought some when the price went up a lot! And I think the price is gonna continue going up! And understanding that is understanding all of the other stuff that I just talked about. But when the price goes up on something, well people get interested in it! And they might get a little bit! And then when people get some the hype surrounds it, the price goes up more. And people start to learn more about it. Which is what happened to me. I bought some, and then I started to learn a lot more about it. Thats really the answer, is that I think that this is a better money! I think its going to lead to prosperity for the people and not socialism for the rich. Its gonna lift everybody up, even the politicians, theyre gonna be incentivized to buy some. Even rich people, theyre gonna be incentivized to buy some. Maybe even central banks. Im not sure about that one.

So I thought it would be good to explore this topic together on: Is it bullish or bearish for Bitcoin? What are some of the things that we need to think about with stablecoins? So perhaps, to start off, just for listeners who might not be so familiar  what is a stablecoin and what are some of the main ones?", "image": null}

What should we even call them  its not even necessarily settled, that stablecoins is the thing to call them. But basically, the way I define them, is: a tokenized representation of a fiat currency that circulates on-chain. So thats really the simplest definition. And then, theres a number of different ways they try and target the return profile of that sovereign currency. The main way is just by being redeemable for units of that currency that are immobilized in a commercial bank. But theres other ways. Some of them are, in my opinion, pretty crazy and not likely to work. The algorithmic uncollateralized modelI dont think weve ever really seen that work. I think its unlikely to work. And then theres the maybe more interesting approach, which is to take some crypto-collateral, which is volatile, and use that basket to create something which is more stable in terms of its risk profile with algorithmic risk management systems. And you could in theory do that against Bitcoin. And then theres a final way to create stablecoins, which is to basically create a pair of Bitcoin derivative and a spot position, so you can have a short and a long position paired up together, and thats one way to create a stable which were seeing out there. So theres a bunch of different ways to do it, but the key idea is, Hey, public blockchains are great for moving value aroundwouldnt it be great if we could move stable value around? I know a lot of Bitcoiners dont like this concept, but the truth is, it really is catching on, and its one of the early industry killer apps.", "image": null}

Because, if youre using a stablecoin, youre outside of the traditional financial system, and you might be outside of that system for good reason. You might be an import/export business operating on a cross-border between Russia and China, and you have very good reasons to not make your transactions known to the authorities. And so, you are strongly incentivized to not broadcast your usage of stablecoins. I think unambiguously the biggest consumers of stablecoins are just entities that are active in the cryptocurrency markets, so: traders, hedge funds, proprietary funds, arbitrage funds, market makers, these are the entities that need crypto-denominated liquidity, and they need an arbitrage or a market maker firm, you know, theyll be active on dozens of exchanges at the same time. They need to manage their collateral. They might have a preference to hold it in fiat terms. They may not want to be directionally long Bitcoin at all times. So they might prefer dollar-based collateral. And so, stablecoins would be a good choice for them. They get the settlement assurances of using a public blockchain, but they also get to manage their risk in terms of volatility. So thats a huge, huge consumer of stablecoins. Increasingly we just also have regular old businesses denominating their balance sheet in stablecoins, and more and more, the firms that we invest on, as a venture fund, will ask us for a stablecoin-denominated investment. They dont want to get bank wires. They want USDC. And weve begun to do that as well. So what were seeing is the whole supply chain of some of these early stage businesses is flipping from commercial bank liquidity to on-chain liquidity, and it flips because theyll receive investment in stablecoin terms, and then their expenditures will be denominated in stablecoin terms. This crypto industry is a globalized system where theres less geographic hubs of consequence, and the talent is much more globally dispersed. For payroll for instance, for a global audience, it actually is generally more convenient to use something like USDT or USDC to pay people if you have employees in fifteen different countries. Thats probably cheaper and easier than the corresponding banking system. And so you see the whole supply chain of certain businesses flipping from being commercial bank based to being crypto-liquidity based. So thats another really interesting new genre of stablecoin consumer that weve seen emerge this year. But yeah it was an easier question to answer two years ago when it really was just traders that was using stablecoins. Today its just all kinds of businesses, I mean we have FinTech providers, weve invested in some of these businesses that are giving stablecoin accessor intermediated access to stablecoins  in countries where theres currency crises, as kind of a FinTech product. So yeah the phenomenon is really taking off and theres a really heterogeneous set of entities that actually use these things.", "image": null}

I mean its a very fair question! I would say probably the main reason is the mental transaction cost of introducing a new numeraire. Now Bitcoin, probably about 50100 million worldwide are familiar with Bitcoin, but probably half of the worlds population is familiar with the dollar. The dollar is the de facto global reserve currency. And then, even in countries where dollars arent the local currency, people still kind of know how to price things in dollars. They have an appreciation for the dollar. And this isnt like my love-letter to the Federal Reserve or anything. Its just a statement of reality. As a unit of account, the dollar is very popular. So I think people are just more comfortable in receiving payments in dollar terms, at this state of Bitcoin adoption. Of course, I expect that to change in the long term as Bitcoin becomes much more ubiquitous, but for now, stablecoins are kind of an intermediate or bridge asset where people are realizing, Hey, public blockchain infrastructure is actually a more convenient way to do business, especially on a cross-border basis. But they havent fully become used to Bitcoin as their unit of account, so for this transitional period, its a really suitable asset, basically.", "image": null}

I mean, this is an established concept today. So, Chainalysis, you know, a lot of people consider them to be villainous. They do put out some good research, so I would encourage your listeners to look at their report where they find  and I have no reason to doubt their methodology, I think its probably quite sound  they find about $50 billion worth of capital outflows from China taking place in Tether terms. So these are real numbers, and so thats a story about evading capital controls. And now, the Chinese government may not like that, but were talking about a new epoch in payments technology. Were talking about digital bearer assets. This is their manifestation. This is what people choose to use them for, and thats just a reality. And if you look at Tether transactions, you can see they happen mostly during Asian trading hours. So theyre very, very popular as an alternative payment system, and a way to offshore wealth from countries that are engaging in monetary repression. A more direct answer, where I have firsthand experience, would be in places like Latin America, Argentina in particular, Venezuela and Colombia. In those three countries the currencies are very weak. Theres a big Venezuelan diaspora which is internally displaced within Latin America. Theres a number of startups that are using  theres a lot of Bitcoin there  but theres also a number of startups that are using stablecoins to give people a dollar savings device. Now there are dollars that are present in those countries, physical dollars. But theyre kind of hard to get your hands on, and they arent necessarily in the right denominations, theres a lack of small denomination bills. And of course dollars are easy to seize. And there is Bitcoinization occuring, of course, but theres also a movement where people are engaging in this cryptodollarization, where they are getting exposure to dollar-based products through public blockchains. Now, Bitcoin is critical in this whole process, but what people are really after, for the most part, is dollars. And theyre seeking dollars as a way to connect remittances, move money around, without asking for permission  but also as a wealth preservation device. Weve invested in startups active down there doing exactly that. I think FinTech experiences that are built on top of cryptodollar rails are gonna be a much more pervasive concept in the next five years.", "image": null}

Zelle is very popular in Venezuela, youre absolutely right. But Zelle is also created by a consortium of US banks, and those banks arent really too keen on having end-users in Venezuela, because there are no formal US sanctions on the country of Venezuela, but there are sanctions on members of the Maduro regime, and its kind of like taint, if you think about taint in the network graph. Its basically the same concept. If you go to the coffee shop which is run by the nephew of the minister of transport, and he happens to be sanctioned, theres a risk that you inherit that as well. So you become tainted by association, and then you get de-platformed from all of your Western FinTech and payment apps. And so that happens a lot. Wells Fargo has been on a real campaign to basically deplatform the Venezuelan users of Zelle. So Zelle is good UX and people really seem to like it, but its very much exposed to what the banks want to do. Now stablecoins have bank relationships, for most of them. The fiat-convertible ones, you know, those ultimately are claims on dollars in a bank. You dont need to interface with a bank to use a stablecoin, you just need to acquire it on the open markets and receive it on an on-chain transactions. 99% of stablecoin transactions dont involve facing off against the bank directly, or against the issuer. So they are kind of less encumbered than commercial bank relationships, and I know people talk about the freezing possibility. Tether has frozen a couple hundred addresses in its history. USDC has frozen a small handful. So that does happen, but its nowhere near as pervasive as deplatforming from the financial system. So its certainly not as censor-resistant as Bitcoin. Now there are stablecoins you can look to which probably have slightly better censor-resistant qualities like DAI, which is built against crypto-collateral andin theory you could do the same with Bitcoin! You could probably figure out how to build a stablecoin using DLCs or other smart contracting technologies to build a dollar-denominated asset which is backed by a basket of Bitcoins, which would also be pretty trustless. And I expect someone to make that in the next year or so. So even within the stablecoin space theres a bit of nuance in terms of the settlement assurances you have.", "image": null}

One other point I wanted to touch on was around the compliance aspects. So you were mentioning there: usually AML laws and sanctions laws that were talking about hereand to be clear, one of them is Politically Exposed Persons  so thats where theres whole idea of, if youre a politician or youre a senior level bureaucrat or something and then your family might be also implicated in that. But with stablecoins its more like, the compliance seems to be occuring at the entry and the exit points, and once youre kind of inside that system it seems to be more of a freewheeling system, wouldnt you say?", "image": null}

And PayPal has the rightand they take advantage of this  to freeze any of those transactions.

Now in stablecoins, as you say, those egress and ingress transactions where you are creating or redeeming stablecoins, theres KYC involved there. But on the internals of the transaction graph, those transactions that are actually ocurring on either Bitcoin, on the OMNI protocol, or on Etheream as ERC-20 transactions, or even on TRON which is popular for stablecoins for some reason, those P2P transfers are really not meaningfully being surveilled. Theres not a lot of identity information that can be associated with them, because its pseudonymous. So on the internals of the transaction graph you have a situation where it much more resembles actual digital cash, in the same way that physical cash transfers do not carry any surveillance. And basically, P2P stablecoin transfers, on-chain, much more closely resemble physical cash transactions, and they have less in common with these transactions on these digital payments networks that were used to. And its kind of a startling realization. JP Koning, who is not a Bitcoiner but he writes fairly intelligently about payment networks, has called this the permissioned pseudonymity model, and its honestly a really big outstanding question whether the state or regulators are gonna take a look at this and realize whats going on and say, Okay, weve got to put an end to this!", "image": null}

Fundamentally, were talking about blockchains which are pseudonymous. Im not sure how you would try and inject identity information.

But you cant transition that really easily to a whitelist model where default node transactions are permitted unless you make yourself known to the issuer. The whitelist model would just make these networks not work. So I dont know functionally what it would even look like for regulators to even grapple with this.", "image": null}

So, pretty meaningful  its up from effectively zero a couple years ago. Now Bitcoin is doing also about $5 billion of settled value per day. Now the thing to note though is that Bitcoins aggregate market cap is north of $300 billion. The aggregate market cap of stablecoins is closer to $25 billion, so you can see that stablecoins have a much higher velocity. Theyre turning over more frequently, whereas Bitcoin has a much slower velocity. So what this tells us is that theyre doing roughly equal amounts in terms of settling value every day, but stablecoins are doing so with the whole supply turning over more frequently, which shows that theyre being employed more as means of payment, whereas Bitcoin is this more slow-moving wealth storage mechanism.", "image": null}

I think its also a good point now to explore the bull and bear cases for stablecoins, and whether they are bullish for Bitcoin or bearish for Bitcoin? Do they work with it or are they in some way detracting from Bitcoin demand? Now I know you are more on the bullish side, but lets first explore some of the bearish arguments, right? So maybe one of the bearish arguments would be, Oh, its detracting from Bitcoin demand! Some people might just stay in stablecoins rather than using Bitcoin. What do you think?", "image": null}

Honestly thats already happened to a certain degree. If you look at exchange volumes, if you look at the pairs that are traded globally, if you look at exchange reserves, you notice that a lot of thesewhat would formerly trade against Bitcoinall these exchanges with altcoin pairs and derivatives with Bitcoin being the more popular asset, either the base pair or the quote pair. Im forgetting which one it is. Bitcoin was the de facto reserve asset of the crypto industry from the inception, right? And over the last couple of years, many exchanges becamed Tetherized, so Tether became the base pair, and all of these markets were expressed in Tether terms, and the main collateral that was held on these exchanges was Tether, effectively. So you had some purist exchangeslike BitMex, they were a purist exchange. They never had any stablecoins on there. The only way to get collateral on the exchange was on Bitcoin terms. But, you know, now theyve shrunk a little, and other newer exchanges like ByBit and FTX, they all use Tether as the main form of collateral, and the main way to make a deposit, and a lot of them quote their markets in Tether. So this has actually already happened! But whats interesting is, here we are, back at all time highs for Bitcoin. So this kind of implies that, Yes, some of this reservation demand for being the reserve asset for altcoin trading and for derivatives trading, some of that reservation demand was effectively removed and was moved into Tether, basicallyand other stablecoins, right? But this hasnt really affected Bitcoin! Bitcoin is still fine! So its just the nature of Bitcoin thats changing a little bit, its more of a global macro asset. It doesnt necessarily need that reservation demand. But yes, unambiguously I think exchanges getting Tetherized did remove a certain reservation demand from Bitcoin, and probably had a bit of a price impact. Its impossible to quantify. The ultimate question is, Can stablecoins sustain this indefinitely? And I would probably argue, No, I dont think they have the same characteristics as Bitcoin, because stablecoins are ultimately someones liability. Theyre a liability of an issuer, in most cases, of a commercial bank. And thats not a great property to have for a monetary good! Pure monetary goods like gold and Bitcoin are no ones liability. Their value comes not from someone else promising to back it, but the value is solely market determined, which is the case for Bitcoin. So ultimately, the true reserve asset, the true monetary base asset at the base of that pyramid  you do want it to be something thats trustless collateral, which stablecoins are not. So I dont think they can ever really fully replace Bitcoin as that key high-powered collateral.", "image": null}

I think thats really nicely put, because ultimately theyre not monetary competitors with Bitcoin in the longer term sense, they are just more like a helping tool or a bridging tool that people are using in the here and now. And also, to the point about volumes and sizes, obviously theres this whole canard that seems to come up from some people who are not that familiar with what Tether is and what some of these stablecoins are. The typical argument is, Oh, see! Bitcoin is being pumped by Tether! What do you think on that kind of argument?", "image": null}

So Ill go on the record here, I dont know if Ive ever really addressed it on a podcast before. Yeah Id love to see some evidence of that. I think the onus and the burden of proof is on the people making the positive claim. All the proof Ive ever seen, all the evidencetalking to traders that have created hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars worth of Tether  is that there is a counter-party there, they are using bank wires, theyre using real fiat currency through the commercial banking system around, to create and redeem Tether! And I am not a Tether user, I personally have never used Tether, but I had Dan Matuszewski on my podcast a while back, and he told me that when he was at the Circle OTC desk they created billions of dollars worth of Tether, and thats with bank wires! So thats taking real dollars and wiring them to the counter-party and getting Tethers against those dollars. And then redeem them on the other side. Thats all consistent with Tether being, at least in some sense, a real thing. Now obviously its impossible to ascertain the reserve quality, and thats a huge shortcoming which I totally agree should be addressed. And Id love to see more transparency behind all of the stablecoin issuers, not just Tether. Its actually hard to get good reliable information on the quality of the reserves, for even the on-shore US based stablecoin issuers. But now this notion is taken a little bit furtherwhich is that Tether is somehow responsible for the price of Bitcoin  is just preposterous to me! Theres one study from Griffin and Shams, which relied on timing analysis, and they found that, during periods when Tether was being issued, Bitcoins price rose in those periods, which is  you know theres so many alternative explanations that arent consistent with Tether somehow buoying the price of Bitcoin. The obvious alternative explanation is, Well, traders were engaging in dip buying, and they used Tether as a conduit to get into crypto exchanges, get into crypto liquidity. Its no coincidence that Tether issuance was happening at the same time as they were placing their buy orders, because they were using those Tethers to subsequently buy Bitcoin. So, theres very simple alternative explanations there. The other thing is, part of their paper relied on this analysis of looking on-chain and seeing when there are high periods of on-chain volumes for Tether and finding that that correlated with Bitcoin price increases. But the other thing to point out there is, price increases are synchronous and coincident with high on-chain transfers, just by their very nature, because when price is going up, theres a lot of activity. Those arbitrage funds kick in to high gear. So thats also something that can be very easily explained. Look, Im not gonna deny that Tether could be doing a much better job of their transparency, and at this point theyre systemic to the whole crypto industry. So, like many others, I would love to see more transparency from them in their reserve quality. But Ive also never seen any direct evidence whatsoever, that Tether is somehow either unbacked or, more perniciously, being used to inflate the price of Bitcoin, which makes no sense. I mean, if youre Tether, and you could magically inflate the price of Bitcoin by printing unbacked Tethers without the market ascertaining that, whats to stop you printing the price of Bitcoin arbitrarily high? Why, in that case, are we only at $19,000? Why arent we at $300,000? You know? The critics dont really have a plausible story to tell here. The other thing Ill mention is that there have been subsequent analyses that have focused on the same Griffin and Shams paper and have found no direct effect between Tether issuance and the Bitcoin price. One was by Viswanath-Natraj. The academia isnt settled on this topic, either.", "image": null}

The other thing to note is that Bitcoin was roughly flat for a long 2-year period here, if you measure from late 2018 to earlier this year. Whereas Tether was increasing by a full order of magnitude. It went from a couple billion in late 2017 to $25 billion today. So for a long period where Bitcoin was trading sideways, more funds were getting onshored onto Tether, partly due to this replacement that I mentioned, where Bitcoin ceased to be the crypto reserve asset, or lost some of its qualities as the crypto reserve asset. So Tether was increasing by hundreds and hundreds of percent, but Bitcoin was flat during that time, so thats completely inconsistent with this Tether inflates Bitcoin thesis as well.", "image": null}

One other point that you brought up there recently is systemic risk and blow-up. That could potentially be another bear case for stablecoins in terms of Bitcoin impact. If one of these big onesfor example Tether, or one of the other ones  if there were to be some big systemic blow-up, could that look really bad for the ecosystem?", "image": null}

And I think the big casualty would actually be longtail altcoins, which trade exclusively against Tether. A lot of these marketplaces and exchanges dont have connectivity to a fiat system, and in fact the reason theyve been able to emerge is because stablecoins exist, right? So once stablecoins were in place, this new set of altcoin exchanges could emerge. And they have done so. They would be the big casualties if Tether blew up. And that would eviscerate the liquidity for a lot of longtail alts that are traded only against crypto-pairs. Theyre no fiat pairs for those altcoins. So they would be the big casualties in my opinion. Now the effect on Bitcoin is more mixed, and I think what is very possible is that there would be an inflow of funds back into Bitcoin as a kind of safety net, because if it emerged that Tether was insolvent or not fully reserved or something, what are traders gonna do with the Tethers that they hold? What is the most liquid pair that Tether is traded against? Its against Bitcoin! So I think thats where they flee! It might be more challenging for them to flee back into their sovereign currencies and they may not want to do that. So I think they flee into the alternative crypto reserve asset which is truly liability-free, and cannot be impaired by a lack of reserves, the same way Tether can be. So my guess is if anything happens to Tether, a lot of capital is gonna flow back into Bitcoin as safety net, the same way that you have a global risk-off even in regular capital markets, and capital flows into US Treasuries, which is considered the safest and most liquid asset. So I would say there is the potential for it to actually cause a huge capital inflow back into Bitcoin. And were talking about roughly $20 billion worth of Tether, so its a really material amount. So bad for crypto markets generally, but potentially good for Bitcoin as this liability free base asset.", "image": null}

I dont think theyre evaluating it, Stephan, to be honest with you. The most number of Tethers that ever existed on Bitcoin was about $3 billion. Now, on TRON, theres double that today: theres $6 billion worth of Tethers that circulate on TRON, theyve got a fixed validator set and its pretty centralized in terms of the node validation and the consensus formation, right? I dont think itd be that difficult for a highly motivated state actor to interfere with TRON if they wanted. But you have more Tethers circulating on TRON, lots more, than ever circulated on the OMNI protocol on Bitcoin. And on Ethereum, you have over $12 billion worth of Tether, and you also have billions of dollars worth of other stablecoins on Ethereum too, like USDC. Theres another $3 billion of USDC on Ethereum! So I think the entities using Tether, they kind of just take it as a given that the blockchains that they circulate on are just gonna function well in perpetuity. They dont seem too concerned about it, and they switch between them all the time. What they do is they use these exchanges as these hubs to switch between Tether Bitcoin, Tether Ethereum, and Tether TRON. So they switch between them seamlessly. It seems like traders treat it as the same asset regardless of the actual blockchain infrastructure that its circulating on. But yeah, it seems to me that people arent really concerned with the underlying infrastructure, and maybe they feel that if something were to go wrong, then the ultimate ledger would be managed by Tether itself, and effectively Tether maintains an off-chain ledger of their own, where they can step in if something goes terribly wrong.", "image": null}

They will almost always say stablecoins! They typically dont say Bitcoin! I dont know if this has been your experience as well? But its certainly the case with me. Central bankers are fixated on stablecoins, and really, Libra is actually the one they care the most about. But increasingly, also, the stablecoins that exist on-chain. So stablecoins have catalyzed a lot of keen investigation on the part of central banks and financial regulators into the crypto space, and they could be the element of this industry that actually gets governments to care about it, and attempt to crack down on it. Because all of these central bankers are pretty afraid of  not necessarily Bitcoinization  but involuntary dollarization, whereby they lose their monetary privilege, because stablecoins become so frictionless and easy to acquire that theres a currency substitution that occurs in their country. And for sure this is something thats happening in Venezuela today, its happened historically in Equador  not with crypto rails, of course, but with physical dollars  so its not too far-fetched to think that this totally is possible. So the way that that could affect Bitcoin would just be by causing a regulatory hammerblow to fall on the industry. Now I think that we all expect and hope that Bitcoin is sufficiently robust that it can deal with that if the time comes, but thats another part of the bear case is that the stablecoins provoke governments into cracking down pretty hard on the industry.", "image": null}

And currently they dont control stablecoin infrastructure. You know, its run as a protocol by a bunch of nodes. And so, thats also part of the reason weve seen a bunch of policymakers in the US express their misgivings about it, even if it is effectively adding demand to the dollar, and potentially exporting the dollar overseas.

And it may be different regulators in different parties who have different concerns. And so the ones who are more concerned at like, say FinCEN, might be more concerned because they have less visibility into their whole financial surveillance network. So lets bring it to the bull arguments then. So the bullish case for stablecoins in terms of their impact on Bitcoin. I guess the main one that I can think of is just that it helps the overall liquidity and greasing the wheels for people to move through the exchanges and through different, other businesses and products and services that can be built using stablecoins that werent otherwise possible with Bitcoin. Whats your view on that kind of idea?", "image": null}
{"title": "SLP236 Nic Carter \u2014 Stablecoins: Bullish or Bearish For Bitcoin?", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/slp236-nic-carter-stablecoins-bullish-or-bearish-for-bitcoin-c1fb5fea9ef9?source=user_profile---------38-------------------------------", "body": "Nic Carter [52:04]: Yeah, so thats undeniably a positive for Bitcoin. Just more liquidity, better connectivity between exchanges. So if youre [into] dislocations and into exchange prices  the existence of stablecoins mean that these arbitrage funds can operate in a capital efficient way, which is good for Bitcoin liquidity. I would say that thats the number one way. But the number two thing I would point you to would be, stablecoins might be penetrating a global audience of potential Bitcoin adopters before they have the experience of using Bitcoin. So, right now, the first experience most people have with cryptocurrency is with Bitcoin. And thats kind of been the default way that people get exposure to storing cryptographic information, storing value in the form of key pairs. And getting used to that concept. But it could be the case that, in a couple of years time, the default that people would get exposure to this concept  this is a transition that people need to go through: understanding information as value. Weve never really had to deal with that before. The default way they might do that would be through a stablecoin lens. Bitcoiners might not like hearing that, but its totally possible in my mind, that thats the more immediately addressable way that people get exposure to digital assets, basically. And I think that could actually be an accelerant to the whole concept, and let people go through that learning experience, and then when theyre ready, they could level up and then go to non-state monetary assets like Bitcoin. I think thats another way is that it penetrates a slightly different niche. Its people that maybe want dollars, and theyre willing to consider this alternative infrastructure for those dollars, and once theyre onboarded onto that and theyre mentally ready, then they can make the leap to Bitcoin. So that would be the second way I think it could be really positive for Bitcoin. The third thing, and this is already a feature of the market, is that stablecoins only exist because of Bitcoin, and a lot of these stablecoin pairs are only liquid in a lot of these markets also because of Bitcoin. Theres plenty of stablecoin usage in Venezuela, but that market was bootstrapped by the LocalBitcoins peer to peer market, where Bitcoin was obviously the main asset. So Bitcoin is this kind of non-state asset which is available globally, permenantly. Its the asset against which stablecoins trade most of the time. So Bitcoin is the true, ultimate clearinghouse of value, and then stablecoins are trading against Bitcoin. So it gives stablecoins a liability-free pair to trade into, and the way I see it is, were getting progressive waves of regulation here, and so the popularity of stablecoins is gonna rise and fall over the years as regulators get more and less onerous. But Bitcoin will always be there, and at the times when nation-states are more hostile to stablecoins, more value will flow back into Bitcoin. And then as things open up again, some value will flow back into stablecoins, as the perceived risk declines. And so I think you just get this back and forth, but the constant is that Bitcoin is always gonna be there as this capital sanctus, to satisfy this demand, and to be this monetary constant, with stablecoins waxing and waning around Bitcoin. So its a difficult concept to express, but Bitcoins permanent presence in these markets is what permits stablecoins to work. So stablecoins certainly need Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesnt need stablecoins, but I think it certainly benefits from their existence.", "image": null}

And the thing I didnt mention is that I believe that stablecoins will be issued against Bitcoin in the future. And we probably arent going to have to wait that long for that to happen. There are already stablecoins being issued against spot Bitcoin, where you short Bitcoin, and you have a spot long position, and that bundle of the two creates a dollar-stable position. So thats one way that some people are creating a stablecoin against Bitcoin. But you could also do it in a Maker style, and theres no doubt in my mind that the smart contracting ability in Bitcoin is gonna progress in the future to a state where its totally possible to build the equivalent of Maker on Bitcoin. And then well just take the most successful concepts in DeFi and apply them to Bitcoin in a trust-minimized way. And if you look at DAI, DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins on Ethereum. It really punches above its weight in terms of its philosophy. So I think the Bitcoin equivalent would also be pretty popular, honestly. A Bitcoin-native dollar-stable asset, facilitated and issued against Bitcoin collateral  I think that is a good idea. And so I do expect that in the future, Bitcoin will be a reserve asset for the issuance of stablecoins, and of course that will increase the reservation demand for Bitcoin. So thats kind of the final thing: stablecoins are strong evidence of the fact that people desire dollar-denominated liquidity on-chain. And theyre willing to issue it against crypto-collateral. And I think Bitcoin is obviously the best form of collateral on-chain, because it has the best volatility characteristics and it obviously has the best monetary characteristics. I do think that its gonna be another way that proves out the value of Bitcoin as this base monetary asset.", "image": null}

One example I can think of right now, Blockstream Green: you can have liquid Tether on there and you can have Bitcoin on there. Is that a scenario that might play out over the next few years, where there might be some people who come into just having some Tethers in a phone wallet, and then eventually they start seeing, obviously, Number go Up, and then they start thinking, Oh! Hey! Why am I holding this USD Tether thing, I can hold some Bitcoin as well! Do you see that as a plausible story?

They definitely understand their users far better than I do. But there is something very convenient about multi-asset wallets, especially Blockstream Green  great, great example. I hear Liquid mentioned all the time in terms of more sophisticated, complex smart contracts on Bitcoin. I expect that some of the first stablecoins issued against Bitcoin will be Liquid assets, that exist on the Liquid sidechain. I also think were gonna get a flavor of wallets that give you options in terms of de-risking your Bitcoin position, so maybe youll be able to flip a switch and change your Bitcoin position to being market-neutral, and effectively flat in dollar terms. And maybe behind the scenes, theres some complicated on-chain derivative transaction that is going 1x short on that Bitcoin, and so youve created an effective stablecoin against Bitcoin collateral. Those are the kind of things that are possible with more development, especially in the DLC space. I think Taproot is also gonna give us some more tools to do this. I dont know exactly what its gonna look like, but I have no doubt in my mind that smart developers are gonna figure this out and were gonna have a much broader arsenal of risk-management products that are native, on-chain, Bitcoin-based, and trust-minimized.", "image": null}

Or a similar idea I guess. One other topic that I think we obviously should hit as well, which is stablecoin regulation. Recently there was this whole blow-up on Twitter about the Stable Act. Can you tell us a little about, first of all, what is that, and then what was your reaction to that?", "image": null}

The Stable Act at its core basically says: stablecoin issuers need banking licences to operate. And their interpretation of stablecoins is that, these issuers are engaged in a banking depository style activity, and as such, they should be regulated by the state as banks. And anybody that understands what its like to get a bank charter knows that this is an absurd proposition, because bank charters are incredibly difficult to come by, they require something like $20 million in paid up capital. Nobody gets bank charters anymore, at least in the US. The number of banks that exist just continues to decline year after year, and theres really been a stark decline in the number of banks in the US over the last 40 years. What this really is, is an attempt to nationalize a private sector industry which has been doing really well! And Im ultimately sympathetic to the core idea, which is: fiat-backed stablecoins should be more transparent about their reserve quality, and they should give depositors assurances that the stablecoins are actually backed on a one-to-one basis with actual dollars in a bank account. Im totally sympathetic to that idea, and it should be the case that there is some mechanism for them to prove that. I would be in favor of something like the FinTech charter  which Brian Brooks proposed  which would be a modified bank charter which takes note of the idiosyncrasies of the FinTech provider. Or something like an expansion of the special purposed despository institution, which is really suited for stablecoins. SPDIs in Wyoming, they are only entitled to hold a full reserve of the asset that theyre custodying, so they cant operate fractionally. Thats kind of what a stablecoin is! Stablecoins are meant to not be fractionally reserved, theyre meant to be fully reserved. So there are a lot of interesting proposals for alternative bank charters. But the problem with the Stable bill is that it was just trying to treat these things like actual, regular commercial banks that engage in maturity transformation and engage in lending, and are heavily regulated as a consequence. But stablecoin issuers dont do any of this stuff! They just immobilize deposits in commercial banks and they issue IOUs that circulate on-chain against those deposits that are convertible for them. So the instrument that is being proposedas the solution to this issue of auditability  is an incredibly blunt and ill-fitting one, in my opinion. So thats the problem with the act, in my opinion. It takes this really archaic view of stablecoin issuers as banks, and tries to force them into this template, which basically makes no sense.", "image": null}

Its actually more broad-reaching in the language in the bill than just stablecoins. It would actually affect FinTech providers like Venmo, PayPal, any e-wallet where you can hold a balance.

Although various legislative bodies are proposing them, not just in the US. I would say it would be welcome to have a specific kind of bank charter, which would be useful, which would suit stablecoin issuers. Because right now the way theyre regulated is: they register as money services businesses with FinCEN, and that gives them obligations around money laundering, AML and KYC, and then they typically have to go after money transfer licences in a bunch of states. And that is not a homogenous regime. The process of getting those licences on a state by state basic is pretty onerous and the states arent necessarily the best regulator for what those issuers are doing. In my view stablecoins are effectively narrow bank or money market mutual funds. They should probably be regulated as such. Look, Im not calling for more regulation, but if there is a regulatory instrument thats created, it should just be mindful of the way they actually operate and not treat them as banks, which they really are not!", "image": null}

I mean we went from $4 billion in outstanding stablecoin float to start the year to $25 billion today, which is just unbelievable! Its just unbelievable! I mean, those numbers in any other context outside the crypto industry would be eye-watering. So theres no question that people want dollar-denominated liquidity on largely censor-resistant blockchain rails on a globalized format such that you can hold those coins in your own possession with a private key. So digital bearer assets, cash-like digital bearer assets, theres no doubt in my mind that theres huge demand in the world for that. Now the big, big question is, is the hammer gonna fall on the likes of Tether and maybe even USDC and all the other issuers? Are the regulators gonna get their way and come down on the issuers? If thats the case, the only stablecoins thatll be left will be the crypto-collaterized stablecoins like DAI, which are much harder to regulate against, because they are just created through smart contracts, as opposed to traditional commercial bank relationships. So theres one scenario where, there are adverse regulatory outcomes for stablecoin issuers, and the only model that really survives is the crypto-collateralized model. And then theres another scenario where stablecoin issuers continue to exist in this grey zone, and continue to be reasonably private and reasonably censor-resistant albeit not perfectly so, and they just keep growing. But I do wonder what is the end state of that? The only thing that constrains their capacity is the balance sheet of the commercial banks that are holding the reserves. But that is almost unbounded. So what happens if you get to $200 billion in stablecoin prefloat? Theres probably a point where it becomes systemic and where bank regulators worldwide try to triangulate the banks that are holding reserves for these things. So I dont think that it can grow indefinitely. I do think that there is a Sword of Damocles hanging over at least the stablecoin industry in its current format, absent of any regulatory clarity. I dont have a firm answer on it, but I do feel that were waiting for a hammer to fall which hasnt fallen yet! I dont know what form its gonna take. I dont think Tether for instance can exist sustainably for the next 5 years.", "image": null}

This is one of the quotes: Imagine you had the opportunity to purchase 1,100 acres of land for approximately $9,000? Can you just tell us a little bit about what motivated you to write this article?", "image": null}

Im gonna have to give credit to our missing patriarch, Trace Mayer, whos been disappeared since February, but he used to talk about the Bitcoin blockchain as real estate. And that you should get some of your own, some of this limited real estate. And then it just was a natural progression in my own mind. You know, So how much real estate in the Bitcoin blockchain is available to each person if it was cut up equally? That was my first thought and I said, Oh, that seems like some relatively easy math if I go get some numbers on about how many people are around, we could divide that into 21 million in Bitcoin times a hundred-million sub-units that we call satoshis. And so how much does each person get? It was two-hundred and some-odd thousandIm not the only person that came up with the number very close to that. Certainly, what number you use for total population is gonna make that vary a little bit. So I went to a bunch of websites to see if I could get some kind of an average. And then you can do the same thing with real estate. Basically you can look around and there have been plenty of people who have tried to map out, How much usable land is on the planet versus how much total land? How much is it used for farming, whatever. I tried to whittle it down to just the usable land that we have available to us as humans, whether it be for farming or for living, versus mountains and swamps that we cant do much with. So you get another number, you divide that by the amount of people that are out there and you say, Okay, well how much land would each person get if you cut it up equally? I forget the number, Id have to skim the article again. But I spent plenty of time checking my numbers. I ran the numbers Pierre! Just in case. [05:49] Its basic math, and so I tried lay it out in such a way that anybody can follow it, they can pretty much check, in the online version of the article, theres a hyperlink you can click on and see where I got my facts from. But it was quite interesting, Im looking at it nowI pulled it up on another screen  231,000 satoshis per person! Based on 7.79 billion people on the planet. Depending on what 1 satoshi is worth, that could be a lot! You know, I like to think of satoshis as dollars. And $231,000 for everybody, thats a lot of wealth to work with  assuming it could buy what a dollar buys today. Yeah I just kept taking that example, that base example, and extrapolating it out to different things. The quote that you brought up was, If you took your fair share of Bitcoin but multiplied that out to what would one whole Bitcoin get you in equal amount of real estate, I think thats where you came up with  at the time the Bitcoin price was $9,000  1,800 acres. It was a lot of acres of real estate for $9,000. Most people on the planet would buy that much real estate for $9,000 if they could, except, there are places in the world where that much real estates not even worth $9,000. But were talking about valuable real estate that people want. [07:08] And so, if you were giving that up to meI guess thats what you were bringing up. I hadnt thought of real estate in the 70s in Manhattan. But when nobody really wanted it, because it was a beat-up city, you could get this stuff relatively cheap. You could extrapolate that out to Bitcoin, because weve got a beat-up protocol  beat up by the media, lets say, thats working pretty good. People just dont wanna look at it! And you can get a piece of this stuff! Its going somewhere, folks! You just gotta get a little piece! It might turn out really well! Had I been in a position to purchase Manhattan real estate in the 70's  I was too young  but, had I understood the things I understand now I probably wouldve tried to buy some. We gotta scarce resource here. Theres only so much of it. If you can get yourself one Bitcoin, thats like  thats hard to fathom what that could represent in terms of the value, your purchasing power, in a hyperbitcoinization world, or a world where Bitcoin is the money that everybody uses. [08:08] As I said, if you have 231,000 satoshis  your fair share  and theyre each worth a dollar, but you had one full Bitcoin? Thats $100,000,000! So thats like the equivalent of you, right now, lets just say you had $100,000,000  yeah, youd be doing pretty good! And youd be doing better than most people on the planet, alright? Theres not that many people who have that much money. So, yeah this Bitcoin thing. It really fascinated me, and it just kept gnawing at me, these concepts, until I just kept  I would write a little bit, type a little bit on my computer, and then one day I put it into a Tweetstorm. Thats what I actually did first. In 2018 I linked up ten Tweets in a row with this idea. And then when I saw Citadel 21 was asking for articles, and I thought, You know? I could turn that into an article pretty easy. So thats what I did, and @hodlonaut was nice enough to publish it for me. So thats the basic story there.", "image": null}

And I love when you break it down to like, Its beer money! You know, you can get these 231,000 satoshis for like  now, the price has gone up a little bit  maybe $35? $30? And then you start thinking about, What if you did that every week? Its like buying a skyscraper in Manhattan in 1972 for $10,000! And maybe not having a tenant right away. It really helped me outline this argument when I talk to people about the asymmetric bet, and try to equate it to what you were saying with Trace. I remember those conversations where, Youre buying a piece of the network. You own this real estate on the network. Because its yours until you move it, or use your key to release it.", "image": null}

Its a scarce amount. Theres only so much, and if you can get a piece of it, and other people are gonna want some of this real estate in the future, then you have a little bit of leverage there. You have some value there that people want and you could use that to live off of, to trade for things. The whole point of money is to store value, and this Bitcoin blockchain that was invented, stores value pretty well so far. And theres only so much of it that you can have available to store that value, and so if you get a piece of it  yeah its an interesting concept: I heard people discuss squeezing more value into Bitcoin. At first I couldnt understand what that actually meant. So youve got these 21 million Bitcoin, each one of em breaks up into 100,000,000 smaller units, and so, the value of any one of those units can be worth any amount of money. Its all what we decide to put on it, as far as value. So, how does it get value? Somebody has one of these Bitcoin, and somebody else says, I got this, and Ill give it to you. So typically thats dollars or Yen  some other form of money that the person who has the Bitcoin can go and use it for something. So [if] the person that has the Bitcoin feels that the dollars theyre getting are worth it right now, because I need those dollars, I gotta go spend em on something  let me give up this Bitcoin because its a good amount in exchange for maybe what I paid for it. Then the exchange goes through! Now, if not enough people recognize that value, theyre not gonna trade. If they think their Bitcoins worth more, theyre gonna hold onto it. So now the next person comes along and says, Hey I wanna get some of that Bitcoin stuff, Ill give you a little more! Because theres only so many of em around, and so this is the market that were watching now: its expanding, as more and more people want little pieces of this scarce pie of digital real estate. They have to bid the price up because the people that have it arent so willing to give it up anymore! Theyre starting to come to the realization that its been working for 12 years straight. As a money it works really well in terms of storing value and transferring value around the world. Weve talked  I know youve had many people on your podcast talk about the aspects of money that make a good money. Portability, divisibility, fungibility, verifiability, scarcity. So Bitcoin has all those things better than any other money weve seen on the planet and people are waking up to that. Theyre starting to see: Wow! This thing has these properties and its been working and its pretty secure and theres a lot of people that are not only working on it and believed in it, but defend it. You know, you and I are considered some of the cyber hornets and we attack when people try to tell us we dont know what were talking about. Michael Saylor seems to feel that the community of cyber hornets are one of the white blood cells of this whole system. Its what keeps it working. We are defending this thing to the death! So much so that well do anything to keep it running! Whatever it meansfix the code, create hardware wallets, create things that we call multisig, which is ways to use this protocol more efficiently, better for people, giving it more value. This is constantly happening every single day by tens of thousands of people all over the world that are not going to quit on this thing! [13:28] And Michael Saylor sees that and he goes, What a crazy ecosystem building around this digital protocol that was invented! Its absolutely fascinating! And it really is. This new invention, this new form of money that weve taken to, that works so well  each little unit is become worth more and more and more! And youve just gotta get your little tiny sliver, and its very likely its gonna go up! And while you brought up the beer money thing, my calculations at that time were basically, you needed about $20.79 to get your fair of Bitcoin. And that was when it was about $9,000 for a whole Bitcoin. And so I thought of that as beer money fornot a heavy drinker. If it was a heavy drinker it would be more than that! But and I went out and I said, Okay, what if Bitcoin cost $10,000? What would it cost you  your fair share? Easy math: 23 cents. What if it was $20,000? $46.20. What if it was $1,000,000? What would your fair share  if the entire Bitcoin blockchain is divided amongst everybody on the planet  what would it cost you to get your fair share at $1,000,000 per Bitcoin? [14:35] And the numbers only $2,310.65! Now, thats a number that almost anybody can divert out of their life. I mean, where I live in New York, most people make reasonable money  sure, theres very poor people on the planet that cant afford that, but my point is this: even at $1,000,000 per Bitcoin its worth getting some! Right? Because its just gonna keep going up! I wanted to extrapolate on this, which I did not do in the article. I have this other article in my head just based on the concept of Number go Up. And Im convinced that the value of Bitcoinif it maintains itself as a worldwide money  will never stop going up! And the basic premise behind my position is this: when you look around at the Earth, theres more value currently on this Earth than there ever was, ever. Listen to somebody like Jeff Booth, hell tell you about how technologys deflationary, business owners are always trying to improve their efficiency, improve their profits. In a world that has sound money  not corrupt money like we have now  capitalism can flourish. So value is created when people can take their labor and natural resources and turn them into something. And somebody else does the same thing with their labor and natural resources and turns them into something. And then they find this medium in the middle that they can exchange with each otherthis thing called moneyand then, what you find is that through efficiencies and use of trade, the division of labor, humans are able to cumulatively continue to put more value on the Earth. [16:22] Now, if Bitcoin is the unit of currency that is needed to denominate all that value, someday, everything is priced in Bitcoin. And [if] the value of items on the planet continues to grow, but the supply of Bitcoin does not, then the value of every Bitcoin must always go up. It literally has to go up. It cant go any other direction unless we destroy  if we have a net negative amount of new value on the planet. So, were destroying things all the time, but were also producing more things at the same time. So if were having a net destruction of valueyes, the value of Bitcoin could go down. In a market where all of Bitcoin is as distributed as its gonna be at any given momentlets say after 2140 when its all been spit out of the system  now it has to find its way into the hands of other people. They have to trade for value to the people who have the Bitcoin  that form of money, right? So now it starts to get dispersed all over the world. [17:20] The amount of value on the planet continues to rise, indirectly! Its kind of the opposite of inflation, in the sense that, when they keep printing money, the value of your labor goes down you need more money to buy things. In this case, youll need less Bitcoin to buy things, because the value of each Bitcoin goes up relative to your labor. So, your labor becomes more valuable over time, and you need less of it to buy things, because the value of your money goes up. So its so connected to productivity of human beings, but its also very connected to the world having the ability to use a freely chosen market money thats not imposed on people by government. Because the reason we dont have real capitalism  we have crony capitalism  the reason we have those types of things is because government have taken control of the money and its basically broken, and some people win and a lot of people lose. [18:17] I was thinking of another thing, I dont mean to skip around. When the government gets involved in stuff, which they fully have done this year with the whole COVID thing, they skew the real market, and resources get diverted in directions they never wouldve got diverted. So, for example, there is an entire industry created around the building and distribution of masks  all over the planet! So if you are able to take advantage of that  youre in the clothing industry, or some other industry  you could just turn your production facility into something that builds masks, and package them and send them out and get them out there as fast as possible, you could take advantage of a government mandate that everybody felt that they had to go buy one and wear it! Now, the market did not want that! People did not ask for masks, they were told they had to wear them. The government created an artificial market, and resources  actual money, productivity, that people wouldve went and bought movie tickets, or went and played golf, or bought themselves a nice steakthey had to go buy some masks for their whole family, because the government screwed them over and skewed the free market. You cant do that when you cant control the money. When you can control the money, you can control people, you can control regulations, you control the police forces and the militaries that uphold all the rules that you decide, or your decrees on the rest of the populous. Yeah, its terrible! Everything is messed up because money is broken. Everything gets fixed when Bitcoin is the money of the world. Thats why we have the meme, Bitcoin Fixes This. But, I also believe Number goes Up is a very valid meme, because I do think Bitcoins value will never stop going up!", "image": null}

Well, I was a bit of a rebel my whole life, so I didnt really like a lot of rules, especially the ones that didnt seem logical to me. But I did believe in government and the state and I used to vote and I used to think it all made a lot of sense. Until I got educated, and a lot of that education came to me after I found Bitcoin. One of the things I came to realize is Bitcoin is a type of truth, and you cantwell let me back up again. Part of my upbringing is to take things apart, I want to see how things work. And in physics, in engineering and natural sciences, you dont get to dictate certain principles. Theyre just there! You have to work with them all the time. And so, I became aware of certain universal things about life, and whenever something didnt seem to make sense, Id want to get to the bottom of, How do you come to this conclusion on any given thing? And so Bitcoin is the kind of thing, when you study it, the logic is there, the mechanism of how it works and the game theory about why people are willing to always act in the right way to keep the system working. That stuff was really fascinating to me! Whats going on in the world with governments deciding what to do, theyre not following basic logic, basic first principles  its so corrupted, that they control the money, that they can create situations that benefit some people over other people, and I think Bitcoin takes that away from them. If, in fact, we ever get to a point where Bitcoin is a world money. They cant make more of it and they cant pay off their crony friends and everything else. Im not sure if I answered your question directly enough, Im not quite sure exactly how you phrased it. I apologize.", "image": null}

Once central banking was invented, I think in the 1600s, those people that were involved never stopped being involved. Their heirs and the people that were close to them kept central banking going as a concept. Ever since it was invented, it was enslaving humans. The people that run all the banks in the world are the people in control. Theyre in control of all the politicians. The politicians do not control the money. The money controllers control the money. So, this is literally whats going on: its a select handful of humans that run this planet because they control money, and they control all the people who distribute the money, protect the money  all of that. So whether its 400 families in this country or around the world, its a select few, and all the people that have sworn their allegiance to those select few, this is why the cover-ups  you know, all the politicians, they all have dirt on each other. Hillarys never getting prosecuted. Shes amongst some of the worst politicians weve ever seen, in my opinion. But, you know, Donald will say how shes evil and this, that, and the other thing, but you just watch: he wont prosecute her. Biden certainly wont. Shell just keep going. None of em! None of em will! Well never find out what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. No chance. None of the people are ever getting prosecuted, because its a big club! And they control the media. The media gets paid off from very wealthy people, thats how they get their advertising. Its just a big money stream, and as soon as you take that power away from them, it just fizzles away. I wouldnt say for a long time. This is a couple generation thing thats gonna have to play out. Theyre not gonna give up easily, and theres a lot of people that benefit  even innocent people that benefit by the system thats been built. All the police and military, they get paid very well with all kinds of great benefits, are not necessarily trying to take over their fellow man. Some of them, you know, abuse their situation. They just want a good job with good pay, and they believe, theyve been indoctrinated to believe that this whole system is created to help everybody and protect everybody. Meanwhile, the politicians keep writing ruleswords on paper  that take more of our freedoms away, and these police that are being told by their immediate superiors and the ones over them and the ones over them, you must enforce these words on paper that weve come up with. Thats what this is all about! Were helping everybody! The sad part is, you just gotta look back in history. Its playing out, its a broken record: you know, every dictator, every socialist communist regime, did the same thing. Its all for your protection. If everybody had guns it would be very dangerous. Therefore, everybody should not have guns. I mean, its a joke! But theyre trying it here in America. Its an interesting experiment, because in all other cases, citizenry of most other countries did not have huge amounts of weaponry to fight back with. This country is starting out  or at least, in this iteration of this country  theres a lot of weaponry out there to fight back against any form of state that might try to impose too much will on the people. Im shocked at all the people that walked around this entire country with masks everywhere! Like literally, its like, Ah, its too much of a hassle to fight, I dont want to get my whole town to rally up and fight against this, so Ill just put on a mask. Thats really sad, because that just shows how far the state has come with its ability to indoctrinate, to convince people to act in ways that they would not otherwise act, and what do they say? Well its for the benefit of our neighbors! We gotta protect the elderly! You gotta help everybody! Yeah, okay, Im not in favor of ruining other peoples lives, but Im also not in favor of you telling me how I should live my life. Or anybody else, for that matter. I think everyone should decide for themselves, take their own risks. Life is full of risks. Thats never going away. Politicians cant make it go away. So everybody has to decide for themselves if they wanna take a risk. Decide for yourself if you believe these politicians that this virus is really dangerous, or go somewhere else and find somebody else thats telling you maybe its not so dangerous. Theres enough people on the Internet you can listen to that totally contradict the governments narrative. Theyre just not getting on the mainstream news. Theyre not getting on the TV, where the general public gets most of their information. So, most of society stays brainwashed, but plenty of people dont believe any of this! I have not believed it from the very beginning. This is just a big ruse to me. This flu thing, its just maybe a slightly stronger version  I dont know. But when 99.95% of the people recover  no matter how sick they get  I dont know how you could tell me that the entire society needs to get locked down. Everybody needs to wear masks, and businesses being destroyed. All of the planet, for a virus that kills almost no one! This is absolute insanity! And yet, people still believe it! They still believe we need masks! Its absolute craziness! I know you commented on a Tweet I sent out  I was in New York City. [27:48] Theyre building little huts in the street! Because people arent allowed in the building to eat dinner, but they can sit in a box in the street and eat the same dinner  what the hell? What is going on with the minds of people? How the hell  I cant fathom. Theres no logic! Theres no fricking logic, okay? I cant believe people. If I cant see the logic to it, then Im not going with you on this, Im sorry! So I was willing to consider at the beginning, it might be a dangerous virus. You saw video out of China, people falling all over in the streets, welding doors shutwhich is insanity to me  and I thought, Oh, man, that better not come here. Luckily, it hasnt. But I said, Alright, maybe its bad. But even from the very beginning, the first week or two, when I was forced out of work, I thought, No way! And I work in a place that has no people around most of the time. So I thought, Now this is bullshit! This government, this little township that I work in, had the ability to close down the entire town and not let a single person work, in wintertime when most people are not there. It would be me and my crew on a job site, nobody around for miles potentially, and Im not allowed to go to work because some government bureaucrat deems the entire environment dangerous or some  who knows what? Its insanity! [29:03] And I started just immediately doing searches online. I gotta find out more myself, Is anybody saying anything other than the stupid government narrative? And immediately, theres answers everywhere! Scientists all over the planet that would refute everything Fauci tells you on the TV, or any of these other bureaucratic pencil-pushers. Its just too much to stomach. Look, I can ramble, my mind just goes in all directions. I hope Im hitting the things you wanted to get to.", "image": null}

So Im an optimist, and Ive been trying not to let it get me down or really get caught up in it.

So, part of me wants to say its a greater evil, because its getting right into the brains of everybody in a way that  you know, its one thing to believe in war in a foreign land, and for people to want to support their country, believing that theyre fighting for freedom or democracy or whatever they think is some type of virtue that they believe they should go and fight for. But you dont have to brainwash everybody  well maybe you do, I dont know. Something about this scares me a little more. You know, like, Im gonna tell you about the Vietnam  you brought that up, I find that interesting that you should bring that up. I can vividly remember sitting on the front steps of my house growing up with my mother, and I was nine, and the Vietnam War was going, and I had heard about it and I didnt understand it, and I started asking her questions about it, like, Why do we have to do this? Why are people dying? Why are we way on the other side of the planet? [32:20] Whats up with Vietnam? Why is that important to us? And she her best to answer my questions, and then we got up to talking about the draft. And I immediately, at nine years old, Im like, No way! Theres no way Im going! Not a chance in the world! And I asked my mother, what could I do if they told me I had to go? And she told me, straight at me, Youd probably have to go to Canada. That was the first time in my life Id ever thought, Move out of the country? Whats Canada? How far is it? I didnt know anything about that! But, I thought, Well, Canada it is then, if thats all it takes! Im going to Canada, man! Im not going across the planet to go kill some strangers! Just fundamentally it didnt seem right! I was just a kid, but whatever. Like, to think my parents raised me well, I dont know! So yeah, I dont agree with any of this, what government can do  at this point  generations of indoctrination through public school systems. I stood there, pledged allegiance to the flag like every kid. Its hard to believe the indoctrination that youre put through in public school. [33:23] At the time, I didnt see it. Nobody did. But the indoctrination that comes from that, then through television and movies, Hollywood, the newpapers, the media in general, its all skewed basically to keep you believing that authority is there, it matters, and you cant stop it and you must heed to it. That is, this big monstrosity called government, is never going away, it controls a lot of stuff, and its in your best interest, so dont try to fight it, right? And its a good thing! We all need to get in line and listen to the boss. In school, they made us line up to walk down the hallways. Somebodys always in charge. And theres nothing inherently wrong with that. Its the blind belief that you must listen to some person of authority no matter what they tell you! See, thats the difference. Its okay to listen to authority  Im an authority at work, I tell people what to do all the time. But its in their economic best interest to listen to me because if they do what Im asking then theyll get paid! Do they have to care what I want? No, they dont have to care. They just have to execute what I want, in order to get paid. [34:31] So theres certain ways that authority is perfectly fine. But when somebodys telling you to live your life a certain way that you wouldnt otherwise choose to do, thats crossing the line. Thats violating the Non-Aggression Principle. Youre in there trying to tell somebody else what they have to do, or something. Ultimately, its what they have to do. Its fine to make suggestions. Its when you force somebody to do anything. So the government have gotten people so convinced that they have to listen to authority that theyre willing to go around and wear masks all over the place  some people in their own cars by themselves, driving! Like, Wow, man! Are they that afraid of the air around them? Im blown away by the brainwashing! How deep its gone! And I can just imagine those bankers of the worldsitting there  I can imagine the evil villain in Batman rubbing his hands together, just laughing, Ha ha ha ha! Look at them! Look at all those crazy idiots just doing what we say! Its mind-boggling to think how much power a handful of people have on everybody else. Mind-boggling, to me. But, its all because they control the money. It all gets fixes when the money gets fixed, literally. [35:40]", "image": null}

So I said earlier that Ive been a bit of a rebel my whole lifeIve never liked authority. Ive always hated the police. I always hated stupid rules. Like, if the playground was closed but nobody was there and it was a sunny day, I thought, Why cant we go in the playground? What the hell is the gate closed for? Why does that matter? Its a damn playground and no one is using it! I just couldnt relate to those kind of stupid rules all over the world around me! So, it really wasnt until Bitcoin, honestly, because once I started to connect how the money creates all the other bull-crap in the world  because thats really what it took for me. I saw so much illogical, unreasonable stuff going on, I never believed or trusted much of what governments said, anyway. But I did not understand how it got created, and how its able to perpetuate, until I understood money. [36:46] And this is againits very convenient how public school systems do not teach how money came about in human history, what different forms of money, views for why some were better than others  none of that was taught. So it was only because of Bitcoin that I was able to learn the history of money, and then start to have the courage to go back to see how money is so connected to all the other human problems we all face. And as far as Im concerned, a broken money is the reason why our societies are broken at every level. Why one religious states hates another. If we all had one money to work with and trade with each other, everybody would just go in their own corner and hang out with their own people, their own types of people, get along fine, Id go hang out with surfers, the skiers can go hang out with the skiers. Everybody would leave everybody alone, for the most part, if nobody had control over the economy. Like I said earlier, the government skews the free market, it puts incentives in place they wouldnt otherwise be in. So now, human beings gotta take their resources and divert them in ways they wouldnt otherwise do. And theyre not always in their direct best interest. Sometimes theyre doing it because the governments making them do it. I follow a lot of rules in the construction industry where Im at, and a lot of those rules cause extra costs. And some of those rules are reasonable, in the sense that they make a building safer or whatnot, but some of them are absolute bullshit all day long, and they just enrich one industry, or  just the idea that you have to get permission to build a house, so you gotta go pay somebody some money to say, Oh yeah, weve looked at your plans, and were gonna let you build it. Meanwhile, you own the land, and none of your neighbors seem to care, but you gotta go pay some money you wouldnt otherwise have to pay, to some other human being who has said  who has written words on paper  we get to control you and guess what? You only get to act if you pay us. [38:38] That is so broken! That is not how free people work! Again, I feel like Im going off on a tangent, but my mind just keeps going along.", "image": null}

Yeah, Im looking to hear from your mind! Im curious, what was it that spoke to you clearly about Bitcoin in terms of like, was it a particular  and Bitcoin and money. Or reality. What were some of the things that crystallized it for you, whether it was Bitcoin or not?", "image": null}

I had three touches. First touch was somebody told me about Bitcoin, a young guy I know, who is into gaming, he was talking about Internet money, I thought it had something to do with gaming. I wasnt into gaming, so I literally never even looked at it. Second time was going through Netflix on the TV, I saw a documentary on Bitcoin. I was curious, I like documentaries in general. So I watched it, but at the end of it, it looked a little too complicated and not necessarily going anywhere. I think that was about 2015. [39:38] But then I was walking my dog, listening to YouTube, I had figured out that, on YouTube, there is a lot of interesting information and went and got myself an unlimited data plan, so I can just listen to anything I want on YouTube and walk the dog, or wherever else I was going. And then I start to learn about YouTube and they feed you things, based on what youd listen to in the past. So theyll make suggestions. So I started listening to several different TED talks, and eventually I came across one, this woman was talking aboutit could have been about Bitcoin  but she connected with me because she related Bitcoin to trust. And I cant even tell you exactly how she described it, but it piqued my attention, because as Id referenced earlier, I work at a summer community on a barrier island called Fire Island. And when Im working there all winter long, the homeowners are nowhere to be found. And they have to trust me! And what I came to realize when I started my business over therewith a perfectly clean slate and basically no reputation  was the fact that, if I do a good job, and build a level of trust with the first couple of customers, maybe theyll tell one of the people and I can build on that. But the thing is, you can never break that trust. You always have to come through. You make a mistake, you honestly own up to it, fix it, do whatever you gotta do, so that those people never lose trust in you, that they can be away from their project, and you can do it without cutting corners and screwing them over. And I learned it by asking people, How did you come to meet? What happened to your last contract? And one woman in particular told me a story where a contractor said that a job was done in the spring, sending the balance, anticipating he would get back to finish it before she showed up, and she showed up and it wasnt really done. So he lied to her, he got paid, and then he had to, you know, make up some excuse and come back and then she was like, Im never hiring you again! So I learned this thing about trust very early on when I was trying to get my business off the ground, that you cannot mess with this thing called trust. Now when this lady connected Bitcoin with trust, I had to know why she meant that. I wanted to know what was this thingBitcoin, why was it so tied to trust?that had piqued my interest, and what could that mean to me? And I had already learned enough about it, I had watched the documentary, I understood it to be some digital money. But I didnt recognize the trust component of it, and so really was what sent me down the rabbit hole. [42:02] That caused me to now search out podcasts of anything Bitcoin, so I could learn, How does it work? And what is it about trusting or not trusting thats going on here? And so we have that saying in Bitcoin, Dont trust, verify. The idea is that you dont trust anybody in Bitcoin. She was talking about it in a way that you could transfer money basically without having to trust that the money wasnt going to show up, or anybody in the middle was gonna steal it. She was trying to reference the fact that, once you understand how the Bitcoin blockchain works, its very trustable. But you dont have to trust somebody telling you that. The good thing about Bitcoin is that its open source and if you dont know how to read code, you can go learn to read code. You could hire someone that could read code. You could eventually get to the bottom line of Bitcoin and decide for yourself if you should trust it. Thats what got to me  as I was learning about Bitcoin, I recognized that, you know, I cant read code, so I can stay for the rest of my life not trusting this protocol. Or, I could learn as much can about it that I can understand, then trust other people who have studied it, if I so choose to. And so one podcast, one interview after another, one article after another, I came to a belief that enough people have tested this stuff that dont have any skin in the game to tell me otherwise  theyre not trying to sell me anything! Theyre not getting my money to convince me to jump into this thing! There is so much content, I was very fortunate because this was early 2017. There was already a good enough amount of content that I could cross-check one podcaster after another, and see, What is this guy saying? What is that guy saying? And I got to look back at videos from the early days of Bitcoin from 2012 and 2013. At MIT Blockchain consortium, or whoever they were, putting out, literally, educational seminars at college level! The stuff that you dont find on Bitcoin Twitter or anything anymore. Its buried now, its too old or whatever! But I was just that kind of person, I had to know! So that did it for me  the idea that you didnt have to trust the protocol, but you could trust it once you understood itwas fascinating to me! And then extrapolate that out into how money worked, and why its so broken, and why we cant trust politicians anymore, and all this other stuff thats so related to good money working properly. That was it! I was down the rabbit hole and no way Im ever going out again! [44:28] I mean, its too deep! Theres so much to learn. Theres so much about this, its just so fascinating.", "image": null}

We all have a reason to want to live, right? I think if you have no reason to live then you might as well stop. Theres a couple of things in there. I gotta lot of life behind me, so I think Ive got some wisdom that I think some people might benefit from. So I learned a long time ago that we go some stages in our lives, where we first  theres Maslows hierarchy of needsyouve gotta get survival first. Stephan Covey in his book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People puts it this way: We first must live, then we love, then we learn, then we want to leave a legacy. So theres four Ls. So in living, we just gotta survive, and you dont really care about anything else if youre struggling for survival. But once you get that, you tend to want to have relationships for love. Its what help bring a little bit of fun to life. So you got survival, you got some relationships. And then, it turns out, most people want to grow! Theyre curious! And so they end up wanting to learn. [46:22] So Ive been down those roads, Ive done all that. I have my survival, Im doing okay. Ive got lots of great relationships all of my life. Ive been learning forever. But then it comes to  what does all this matter? What does it mean? Am I going to leave any kind of legacy on this planet whatsoever? Theres billions of people that have come and gone and none of us know who they were. None of us. Theres only a handful of people that have any kind of legacy on this planet. I dont expect to have one. Im too small of a fish in a giant pond! But, I can still have an effect on people individually. And that could have a ripple effect. The exponential effect: if I affect two people and they affect two people. So my efforts could actually help millions of people down the road that will never know that I had an effect on their future or will never know me, but if I stick to first principles, honesty and integrity, and truth, then I feel like any effort I put in that direction is not wasted. That I feel like my life was not wasted. And even if I am not known the world over as somebody important on this planet, I know that Ive done the best that I could with what was given to me. I didnt squander it. I tried to live an upstanding, honorable life, and then pass that forward! Pay it forward to somebody else that could use either my experience or simply my knowledge. People dont know about this money. [47:45] Im gonna back this up and say, if I was to give an elevator pitch to somebody and I had no idea where they were coming from, I would say, Money is the most important invention humans have ever come up with. It allows the division of labor, it allows us to get away from bartering, it allows us to trade, and it increases the value on the planet. Bitcoin is the best iteration of money that humans have ever come up with. Because its got all the best properties of money, plus some additional ones that previous forms of money did not have. If Bitcoin is the best form of money, and money is the best invention humans have ever come up with, Bitcoin, by default, is the most important and best invention humans have ever come up with. Now, if you dont want to go shout that to the world, I dont know what to say! Its like Michael Saylor saying, Is this a non-correlated asset or is this fire that will change humanity, right? Bitcoin is gonna change humanity. Its not just a non-correlated asset. Its not just an investment. This is the best form of money, which allows pure economic calculation for every human on the planet! Free and fair trade for everybody! Productivity and prosperity for everybody on the planet, because this invention is now here! This is the most important thing ever created, ever. And we are living in one of the most important and influential times in all of human history, where we are watching humanity adopt a free market money that cannot get corrupted by governments. Gold was the best thing we had, but it got corrupted. This Bitcoin thing, I dont see anybody explaining how its gonna get corrupted. Its set up in such a way that it cant be. The game theory is so perfect  at least so far  that its fascinating. So as far as Im concerned, I cant not talk about this. Future generations need people like us to not give up. We will be talked about a hundred or a thousand years from now, like, Man, those people were strong believers! Had they not done this for us, we wouldnt be here today. We need to thank our ancestors. Its that kind of thing, that I believe were all living in. We have to stand up against the craziness thats out there. We have to push it in everyones faces that youre missing out! This is not only good for you, this is good for all of humanity. This is not a selfish thing on my part  sure, if more people adopt it, will the number go up? Will my Bitcoin be worth more? Of course it will! But if you dont adopt it, somebody else will. Theres enough people on this planet. We dont need everybody to adopt it for this thing to be worth value, and for the rest of the world to be forced into adopting it. So everybody that I could talk to could ignore me, and Number will still go Up, because millions of people get convinced by someone else other than me. It really doesnt matter if my efforts are wasted. Theyre in the right place, and hopefully, it ripples out into the energy of the world in a positive way, affects lots of people, and humanity is better off in the long run. Thats all I really want to see, is a happy, peaceful world, where everybody leaves everybody alone, and if you wanna go surfing you can go surfing, if you wanna read a book on a mountaintop you can go do that, that some government is not gonna come along and say, Sorry youre out of bounds! Oh, you out there in the ocean? Come in, you need to wear a mask! I mean, did you see the videos back in the early part of the year? Guy out on a paddle-board by himself in the ocean and the cops were calling him in, because hes supposed to be in his house or something. Give me a break! Oh, man. This is important stuff! We gotta get the word out. I dont care if I make a dime off this directly because of my words. Literally. You know, theres another thing: people often talk about, when left up to the market, you have this thing called the tragedy of the commons, where people wont take care of the things that they dont want to own. Thats not true at all. I dont own Bitcoin, and Im taking care of it like its my most precious little baby, right? And everybody in this space feels exactly like me! And I got out of my way, for free, to talk to you or anybody else that will listen, because  Im not trying to get paid directly for my efforts here. These efforts are important not just for me, but for a lot of people beyond me. When the politicians talk about, Were all in this together! Yeah, we are when it comes to something like money, that helps us all, that takes the power away from some parasite humans. Yeah, were all in this together. In that regard, I feel very connected to everyone of the other humans on this planet. Were definitely all in this together. But as far as the way that they want things to go, No, were not all in this together  because they just say how it goes and were supposed to just listen. So, this is super important stuff and Im super passionate as you can hear. And Ill never stop talking about Bitcoin, and Ill never stop trying to convince people that they should get as much of it as possible. And hopefully that article I wrote convinces a few people, well see! I appreciate you promoting it, I see you re-tweeting it and stuff so thats very nice of you! And the more people the better, we just gotta get the word out! You know, that article will never change  other than the price of Bitcoin, the fundamentals in that article will never change, and Im glad I wrote it because somebody many years from now can read it and they can still get the point. Theres nothing about that thats ever going to not be the same. Well, you could change the numbers in terms of the amount of people. The Bitcoin will never change, the amount of land will never change, so just change the numbers around, but the principles will never change. Get yourself some of this limited stuff, because its probably gonna be good for you.", "image": null}

If we were to look at the world from first principles, and align with first principles, and were looking at: engineering, accounting, math, integrity, honesty, trust and trustworthiness, music, food, peace, contentment, sex, self-actualization, rational self-interest, kindness, and most importantly peace and love, how should Bitcoin be viewed as part of the universal energy of our existence?

So, I had to give this a lot of thought. Anybody whos taken a basic statistics course will be able to understand what a bell curve is, and that we can look around at things and we can get generalizations about a lot of things, but never necessarily 100%, thats why in the middle of the bell curve, thats where the averages are gonna be, that at the tail ends thats where the outliers are gonna be. But theres something about physics and engineering thats definite. So lets just take gravity for example. We can measure gravity in different ways, but it never stops. Its always acting upon us, and were stuck with it. We have to figure out to the best of our knowledge what its doing to us and how can we use it or overcome it. So there are principles about the way waves move  sound waves, water waves. There are principles that govern the vibration of molecules, at least to the extent that humans have been able to visualize or observe these things and measure these things. So on a molecular level, we can almost anticipate  its like action, reaction. If this happens, we can anticipate that will happen. So if we heat up some water, eventually when that water temperature gets to 212 degrees its gonna start boiling. It happens every single timewe can count on it, right? Thats because, in physics, the molecules, they act a certain way and they always act that way when given the same parameters. So in this case you add heat, you add enough heat, the molecules speed up, it turns into a boil. Nothings ever gonna change that! All we can do is work with it. So these first principles that are all over the place are there, theyre acting on us. Another interesting thing I noticed when I was watching a slow-motion video had to do with music notes. And I found it interesting that when you take a note, any note, and you photograph a guitar string and you watch the vibration of that note, and you go up one octave or go down one octave, the speed at which the string vibrates is exactly double or exactly half. Literally exactly! And theres a principle going on there! Its the way energy flows. And so, theres a lot of principles that are acting all around us, all the time. When we align ourselves with those principles, things work out. When we dont align with them, they dont work out. Let me take it to an example with surfing: so when Im trying to go surfing, I gotta deal with a whole bunch of physics that I have nothing to do with. Wind makes waves, those waves come towards the beach, the bottom contour forces the waves to rise up, they peel in a certain given directionbut every wave is a little bit different  and the wind, the tide, they all can affect it. But in general, Im gonna want to paddle towards the beach, Im gonna want to get up to the same speed as the wave, Im gonna want to stand up and, using the physics of my board, lean on the board in such a way that it makes turns in the direction I want it to go, and then I get to ride the energy of this wave thats moving towards the beach whether Im there or not. So the physics involved with all of that, when you go back to the bell curve, theres a billion, gadrillion, gazillion variations on that single wave, me riding it, and my position on that wave. [57:35] If I was six inches over when I started my paddling, my wave wouldve been different. When I stood up, if my feet were one centimeter a little [more] forward than they were, my ride wouldve been different. So, the principles underlying what combination is gonna give you what outcome  theyre there, theyre set in stone by the universe. Its what combination of those principles that we put together that gives us our outcome. So, you go surfing at the very same surf spot where the wave peels in the same direction every time, and still, every wave is different, every time you stand up you gotta find the right spot on your board, and then, you have to look at that wave as its rising up in front of you and constantly make adjustments to get your ride and go down the line and get that enjoyment out of that. And all of that is based on physics that you dont get to control, other than your own motion! Its like, you have to blend you with the energy around you. We are doing this over time. When we listen to music that we like, we are blending our brainwaves with harmonic resonance of sound that is pleasing to us, it comes through! When two notes are dissonant from each other, our brains dont like it. Theres an interesting phenomenon in photography, that generally, people like pictures that are divided up like a tic-tac-toe board, its the rule of thirds. So you can look at many, many photographs that are cut up into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, and something about our human nature likes that. We tend to gravitate towards things that conform with a certain energy that we as humans find pleasing. I think it translates into food, although Im far from any kind of food connoisseur. But there are certain foods that, when combined together, enhance both of the things put together, and other combinations that completely destroy each individual ingredient. And theres something about a harmonic resonance of the molecules on our taste buds, that we love this combination, we hate that. And thats generally true! Will some people like music thats out of tune? Yeah! Theyre at the very tail end of the bell curve. Whereas, everybody else is generally in the middle  when the musics in tune, and it follows the scale, and the notes come together right. You end up in the middle of the bell curve where almost everybody seems to think its good. It sounds generally pleasing. [59:56] The same with things we see, and so theres a scale  on the bell curve  from one end to the other, going through the middle, where you find the bulk of everybody. So those are the things where we are interacting with the world around us. Theres this phraseI wish I could think of it  that describes the grey areas between every variation of any system. But the principles of nature are underlying all of this, and they never change. These are the first principles. So when you said it, you made a list of things, because I wrote them down. So something like truth, is a principle. Now its not a physics principle, its not an engineering principle like building a building where the structures gonna collapse if you use the wrong materials, but truth is one of these things thats an underlying principle. When you have truth, you have the ability to trust. What we find when were trusting something, we are trusting the overlapping of character and competence. So were trusting somebodys character  are they truthful in how they are. Do they seem honest? But what were also trusting is someones competence  do they know what theyre talking about? And so, when youre trying to find truth, youre trying to also extrapolate trust and trustworthiness in order to find that truth, so you gotta dig down into these things in order to know if truth is actually there. But truth is there somewhere! Its a matter of trying to uncover it. One of the things we say in Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is just a big truth machine. Because it keeps track of a limited number of digital files perfectly! And we can absolutely count on the truthfulness of the Bitcoin blockchain, because we know how it works, we know how the transactions are propagated, we know how the blocks are made, and its all based on math that all can be corroborated. And so theres this truth that is basic, absolute truth! Its like a force of nature! Its built in such a way that it resonates harmonically with the energy around everything. And you can trust it! [1:02:20] Once you recognize the truth that it bears. And you can learn to trust it and use it. And its like any other trust that we can find: in engineering, you can test materials, setting up examples, and breaking things to the point that you know how much energy it takes to break something. And then you can engineer a building to not fail, because the loads will never get to the level of what you calculated it would need [for] it to break, and then you put a 100% safety factor just to be careful. So now youre using truths in engineering to give you something that may or may not work. So for example, let me extrapolate out further: you are looking at a bell curveengineer calculates a whole bunch of things he knows are absolutely going to always happen, and you go out and you get a set of plans and you start building the building, right? And unbeknownst to you that a whole bunch of people along the way cut a little bit of corners thinking it wasnt gonna matter. And then in the end, the collective cutting of corners causes something to fail. And no one saw it coming because the engineer designed the building to be perfect and it all shouldve worked! Except that somebody took their own belief or their own opinion, without checking with truth. And they said, Nah, we dont need this! Because they just believed it! They just thought, for whatever reason, they didnt check with actual truth. So theres a lot of this thats tied together around us in the world, I think. Things like music, things like taste, things that are visual, things that are social like truth or trustworthiness. These things have certain fundamental principles that are unchangeable and its us that changes around them. Its us that try to find harmony with them. And its when we find the best harmony with all these different universal first principles that are around us anyway, that we find, not only our own happiness, but we find a way to live in this world and deal with truth and those kinds of important concepts. [1:04:18] I guess thats the best way to think about it. Ive said this many times, that the principles dont care about your knowledge of them, or your attitude towards them. They act anyway. You dont have to know about them, and if you know about them, you can have a crappy attitude about them, and they dont give a crap! Principles will act on you! Gravitys gonna act on you! Engineering forces are gonna act on you! Truth is gonna act on you, whether you like it or not! You wanna lie all day long? Truth is gonna come back to bite you in the ass one day! Its just how it works! These things areI dont know theyre just the basis of everything that works on this planet. The closer you get to fundamental truths in all these different areas, the easier its gonna be to not only navigate this crazy world, but get enjoyment out of this crazy world. And when I found Bitcoin and I started connecting these dots in my own head, about all the things that Ive had to uncover myself about how things actually work, it just became so strong for me, in terms of why it matters and why I care so much about it  getting back to why I give a crap to talk about this all day long. This is so important! [1:05:27] I just wanted to back up a second: when I was a kid I took everything apart. I just wanted to know how everything worked. One of the best presents I ever got was a toolbox full of tools when I was like 8 years old. And I could work on my bicycle! And you know, if you try to fix the brakes on your bicycle and you mess that up and you need them and they dont work, youre gonna figure out real quick that principles actually matter. Tightening the nut just the right amount is gonna matter! Lining up the pad to the tire just right so touches when you squeeze the brake is gonna matter! Making sure theres no rust inside the cable housing so that the cable slides smoothly inside  these are all physics principles. They absolutely matter to the functioning of your bicycle brake! And if one of those things isnt working right, you may find yourself in position where youre gonna crash because the brake you thought was gonna work is not working, because some of the principles are broken. So when youre living in a world where you dont get a chance to argue this stuff  you have to align yourself with it? Thats the world I grew up with, literally everything around me had to fit in to this if I cant see the logic Im not going with that! And so, its why Ive resisted stupid government edicts all the time, and stupid rules that are everywhere on the planet. I just cant relate, they make no sense! You know, victimless crimes that are everywhere! This is just other human beings writing words on paper, deciding that they want other human beings they dont even know to act in certain ways, and if they dont, theyre gonna take violence upon them, steal their money, just because they dont like something about them? I just cant stand any of that! [Theres] no logic in it, its not fair, its not right! I just push back against all that! [1:07:01] Bitcoin was just the thing that tied it all together for me, literally. Once I realized why moneys important, how it works, how everything stems from moneyliterally everything stems from money  that we get to value [things] in society and it all comes because of the use of money. Once I saw that and once I saw how important Bitcoin was, it allowed all these other things Ive known intuitively to become connected. Its allowed me to be able to have this conversation with you. To know and feel deep down  Ive studied some of it as well  to know that these things are real. Theyre true! Theyre there, and we dont get to choose about them, we just get to act with them! I wish I could remember the quote exactly, one of my favorite books is the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, because its based on principles. And in the book he tells a story of a ship captain calling out on the radio, Youre in our lane! You must move out of our lane! Theres a big light out in front of them and theyre worried theyre gonna crash into another ship. And so the radio comes back, No! You get out of our lane! And the captain says, You dont know who youre talking to! Im Captain So and So of Such and Such Big Important ship, and you need to move right now or were going to hit you! And the voices comes over the loudspeaker, I dont care who you are! This is the lighthouse! You better move or youre gonna crash! Right? So principles dont give a crap! [1:08:22] They act on us whether we know about them, or whatever the attitude of them is. So principles are like lighthouses  we need to bend ourselves to them! They do not get out of our way!", "image": null}

Surfing! You know, surfing, because its given me an identity and its allowed me to travel around the world and  just the experience of going surfing is absolutely amazing! I dont know how else to describe it other than to be literally in unison with nature for several seconds at a time when youre riding a wave. The unison you feel  the idea that the ocean is doing what its gonna do and youre trying to sink up with it  its not only really, really hard, but its really fulfilling when you get to do it, and when you get good at it! So its given me kind of a purpose in life. Bitcoins been huge, obviously, but I think Bitcoin just, like, enhances my surfing now. It just makes my surfing even better I guess! Its given me so much! The other thing, Im just gonna divert here for a quick second, but, learning about truth, and learning about Bitcoin, I was very fortunate to get invited to a steak dinner with Saifedean and Pierre Rochard in New York City, where I was already in the process of trying to improve my health, and then I got completely red-pilled by Saifedean about, You can only eat steak! And like, Meat is the most important food! You shouldnt eat anything else! Im like, Woah! This guys a little extreme, but okay! He wrote a really good book, so, maybe I should consider what hes talking about! But as I said I was already on a quest to get healthy here, and I learned that a lot of the food I used to eat was really bad for me. And it worked! I switched around, I eat mostly meat at this point, and my health has dramatically improved, and its improved my surfing! So all these things are so tied together! When you find truth in one thing, all of a sudden you stumble along on some truths somewhere else. I have to say, my enthusiasm for my surfing has increased because my health has increased because Ive found a little more truth in dietary information because Ive found a little more truth in Bitcoin! [1:10:40] Its amazing how it ripples through your life. Surfing is definitely a little more important but, boy, Bitcoin has had a huge impact. Its been almost 4 years its been in my life, so. Ooh, its getting close! Maybe in another 20 years I might have to say Bitcoin has been more impactful!", "image": null}

Thats a tough one, theres so many and theyre all unique. I have to say Endless Summer 2 was really good, because it built on the first Endless Summer, but it used a little more modern take. But then theres another one called Riding Giants which, when I saw it was unbelievable. Because riding super big waves is really amazing. Ive been out in some very big surf, but I would never try to tackle some of the waves that some of these guys ride, so that was impressive. I saw it in a movie theater on a big screen so that was really awesome. I mightve even seen that in an IMAX theater, so that was pretty good. But theres a lot of little cult ones. I went to a place in Mexico many times, over and over again, because its such a great surf spot. Its called Puerto Escondido. And when I went there  it was probably in the 80s and 90s when I was going there a lot  there was a guy that planted himself there all season and he would shoot videos. And he put out a couple, theyre called Puerto Underground by a guy named Dave Ogle. And some of the footage hes got is absolutely phenomenal! I was fortunate enough that he filmed me on enough of my waves, while he was out there making his surf videos, and he made me my own personal surf video that I got on VHS tape, I gotta make it digital one day. But I got me surfing this one spot and he put music to it, its my own little professional video. But he made some really insane videos of this place, Puerto Escondido. Id have to say theyre up high on my list of good videos.", "image": null}

I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity. Ive had a lot of time to think about this when you first offered this to me. And so I did get out a lot of what I wanted to say already and I really appreciate not only the opportunity, but the questions you asked me and the way you posed them allowed me to run with it, so to speak. If anybody does want to find me they can find me on Twitter @surferjimw. Thats pretty much it. Id never done social media until I started learning about Bitcoin. I was told, Well, if you wanna learn about Bitcoin you better follow some people on Twitter! And I hit myself on the forehead and said, Ah! I gotta learn Twitter? What is that crap! Social media? I dont want to do that! I never did Facebook. But I did it! Twitter was worth it! Twitter is a very fascinating platform, theres a lot of smart people on there, and I spew out enough stuff, some of it might be worthwhile, so if you want to hear what I have to say, Im on Twitter. My last shill is gonna have to be for the Long Island Surf Bar. So a good friend of mine, he went down to Typhoon Lagoon in Disneyworld in Florida, where you can rent the wave pool and go surfing in it. He did that, and then he was just so enamored by the whole thing, he came back and said to me, Jim, we gotta build a surf bar on Long Island! And I said, Well, Chris, good luck! I cant build a surf bar! I mean, Ill help you if you want to try and build one. And he wanted to! And so weve been spending about the last five or six years  he, myself, and his son, trying to figure out if we could build a surf bar. And him and his son  I give his son a ton of credit, he was just a teenager when we started the process, but he has taken the bull by the horns and he has run with it. This kid knows anything and everything about this project, and over the past five years we built the website, we built the mailing list, we did a lot of market research. And were gonna build the first wave pool on Long Island! We have cutting edge technology that enhances all of the technology thats out there. We have some proprietary stuff. I built a test tank. I was asked to build, based on the specifications given to me by the pool designer. So we run little mini waves in our little test tank. Chris went out and bought land  we got three acres of land to build this wave pool on. We have site-plan approval from the town of Brookhaven, where its going to be located. So theyve already given us permission to build the surf bar. And we are now in the process of getting the permits to build the park, so they say, You can build it but now youve gotta show us how youre gonna build it. So weve gotta meet water filtration standards and all the crazy safety standards for a public pool, but we are gonna build a state of the art wave pool on the land, the tag-line is, Always 7 ft. and hollow. So we want a wave that you can stand up inside the tube, every single wave, over and over if you want. And we believe we can make that because the tests in our tank show us that were meeting all our benchmarks that we need to meet. So were hoping by about a year from now this things gonna be open. Oh! And let me tell you another thing: were gonna make our own electricity. This ties into Bitcoin so this is a good ending for this whole podcast. We are gonna make our own electricity. We ran the numbers on what is it gonna take to make this thing possible. We figured out, if we bring natural gas into the site and run our own natural gas generators, we can make all our own electricity! We also figured out that all this equipment thats gonna make the waves and generate the electricity is all gonna produce heat, so were gonna take the heat and were gonna stick it in the water, and were gonna have warm water year-round. This is gonna be an outdoor pool but in the winter it will still be warm. And then I got to thinking, after listening to Marty Bent talk about Great American Mining and what theyre doing with flared natural gas in the oil fields, I thought to myself, You know, the generators are gonna run constantly, but the load on the generators is gonna go up and down constantly. And I see no reason why we cant turn on and off Bitcoin miners and take advantage of the excess electricity that would just get dumped back into the grid or sent back into the ground if it isnt used. So I pretty much have the guys convinced, my partners here, that we might be setting up some Bitcoin miners and well be making sats and waves on the Long Island Wave Pool. First of its kind! I would like to see that play out, but even if it doesnt, well make a really great wave pool and I may spend the next 10 years building ten more of them with my friends son, who has a plan to build ten in the next 10 years. So Ive got that going for me along with Bitcoin, so Im about as stoked and optimistic as anybody could be in this space, thats for sure! Thats my story!", "image": null}

Simon Dixon here, and welcome to the fifth episode of Bitcoin HARDTalk where we give hard talk about the hardest form of money. I wanted to do an episode on all the reasons why you should not buy BitcoinI like to give a balanced view, not just the bull case. I know its very easy to get caught in the bull case. But what can go wrong with Bitcoin? And theres certain things that have come up over the years, some genuine objections, some which are just misguided, and some that have just been proven wrong, just by experimentation and experience over time. And so in this episode, what I wanted to do is cover some of the different political scenarios, and also cover the technical reactions as a result of some of these common objections to why Bitcoin might fail. In order to do thatbecause Ive got different ideas and different theories  I wanted to bring somebody in that could answer some of the more technical questions. You will know that I am a finance guy that got pushed into technology, and found technology. But I wanted to get a technical guy thats also good at thinking about some of the political and technical. And really when that came up, there was only one person that I had in mind, and thats really my go-to expert whenever I want to learn something technical and have somebody that can actually explain really technical and complex subjects in a real easy and understandable way, with a bit of philosophy and also a bit of politics injected in. And to me theres only one guy that came to mind, and thats Andreas Antonopoulos. Andreas is the author of Mastering Bitcoin, Mastering Ethereum, and The Internet of Money. Hes a technical guy but hes also very proficient in both the philosophy, the politics, and the technical side of Bitcoin. Hes been around since 2012, so hes seen all these different things play out over the years. And really, Andreas has often been the first person that people come across, certainly in the earlier days when they discover Bitcoin. The reason for that is because he has a real gift as an educator to actually articulate different schools of thought, and educate people, and is responsible for more people getting into Bitcoin than many people I know. So the first thing you probably think is, This is gonna be Bitcoin HARDTalk, so why do you have somebody thats not gonna give hard objections to Bitcoin? Well, we really try to tackle some of these issues, so we covered all of the common objections: whether it be quantum computing, whether it be making Bitcoin illegal, whether it could be mining centralization, and we covered all of the common things that would really stop someone from getting into Bitcoin and play out different scenarios. Ill cover more of the political/financial side and Andreas will jump in with the technical, and then well come up with a general philosophy. And we end the recording with what we consider to be the biggest risks to Bitcoin. Now I do want to warn you: sometimes Andreas can get pretty technical, but I challenge you to persist through that, because at the end, we cover all of these, and we bring it all together into simple-to-understand, different scenarios that everyday people may not be so technically gifted at as Andreas can understand. So just push through the technical jargon, and well see you on the other side. Okay, so Im really excited to be doing this. Andreas and myself have crossed paths in many different environments across the years. And finally we get to create some content together. And I was thinking to myself, what is the best thing that Andreas and myself could do? And I think with the current stage at the moment, theres lots of new people, were in a new adoption cycle where lots of new people are coming in. And throughout the years, weve pretty much seen every single reason, or every single objection that one could give, to not wanting to be involved in Bitcoin, or the same things that people have. And what I wanted to do in this is cover some of those objections. And I want to do it from the perspective of not just always thinking of the bullish case for why people should be involved in Bitcoin and what can happen, but also just tackle some of the genuine risks and what are real risks, what are fake risks. And so in doing that, I thought Andreas is probably the person that I would go to, if I ever wanted some of the technical perspective, not just simply because he knows the technology, but because he can also communicate and help people understand. And I think Andreas, you like to think of yourself as an educator, and I think youve done a great job educating in this space.", "image": null}

I think of myself as the greeter  the Bitcoin greeter that meets you when you come in, Im like, Hello, folks! Welcome to Bitcoin! How can I help you find something today? The funny thing is that the journey you described, which is: overcoming all of these risks and objections, its not something that only newbies go through. I think its something everyone in Bitcoin goes through. So theres no such thing as someone who came into Bitcoin fully convinced, and wasnt a skeptic. And that shouldnt be the case. We should all be skeptics, right? At first. Because, what were talking about is something that defies many of our expectations and beliefs  even Satoshi Nakamoto was a skeptic! They didnt come in and say, This is going to work! They came in and said, Well, this might work, and if it did work, heres how it might play out. [06:46] And they didnt make all of those predictions correctly. Every single person after that came in with, I have a lot of questions about how this could go wrong! And the process of becoming persuaded about the robustness of this system comes from two-parts experience: the (1) first one is, as youre thinking and understanding more and more of this system, these little fears pop up, these little risks, and youre like, Huh, I wonder if, if this happened, could that be the Achilles heel? Whats the catch here? And you come up with these risks. And so gradually overcoming those and understanding, Oh, well, no, that wouldnt actually work. Bitcoin would survive that. So one perspective is analyticaltheoretical: I dont think that would work because heres why the technology would adapt. The second partwhich is even more interesting  that Ive experienced, is: actually seeing these things play out. Like, what happens if the one and only exchange loses everything two years in? That actually happened! And, I was like, We probably wont survive this. And then we did. And that taught me something about the robustness. So I think thats a great basis for us to help people go on that skeptic journey, because its a healthy perspective to have. Talk about some of the theoretical attacks but also talk about some of the experiences weve had that have persuaded us that this isnt just theory. That, in practice, weve seen some some of these things play out.", "image": null}

Okay, well since you brought that one up, maybe for some historical context, how did you feel when theres this one exchange that was pretty much the only place where, I mean  some people say that it was about 70% of the whole Bitcoin supply was being traded on Mt. Gox  and then it turned out that the whole thing is just shut down, withdrawals, and its all over. Can you remember where you were and how you felt when that actually happened?", "image": null}

So, first of all, my skepticism of Mt. Goxwhich was a website that was originally bought as a Magic: The Gathering online exchange, and then converted and pivoted to being a Bitcoin exchange, and was the only Bitcoin exchange. My journey of skepticism began long before Mt. Gox failed. Mt. Gox had had a lot of growing pains, and every time the volume would go up, the lag of trading would shoot through the roof, which would cause a lot of people a lot of tears, right? If you put in an order at a specific price, and then it takes 20 minutes to fill that order, but in the meantime the price has dropped significantly, and you end up losing moneythat hurts. So I remember that I had been railing against this site and saying, Listen, this isnt safe! Do not store your money here! This was the beginning of me beginning to say things like, Not your keys, not your coins. I had started saying that back then, and telling people why they shouldnt leave money on an exchange. But, even though I was saying that, theres two aspects: theres a lot of people who had money on the exchange who were basically treating it as a vault, as a wallet, not an exchange. But there were also all of the exchange functions. If you wanted to convert USD or any other currency into Bitcoin or back, that was pretty much the only service. This was before any others existed. I remember getting the call  this was before it became public  I got the call from some people who were running one of the biggest wallets in the space, who I was working with at the time. And I was in a diner meeting with some family friends for brunch in San Francisco. And I got the call, and I said, Excuse me one second, I gotta take this callit seems urgent. I took the call and they said, Um, we just heardits probably going to go public in the next hour or so  Mt. Gox is bankrupt. The moneys all gone. And its gonna shut down. And I remember feeling, like, Oof. Thats it  were done! You know, by that point, Id put a year and a half of my life into this, all of my savings, Im in debt, I dont have a job, I havent yet been paid to do anything in the Bitcoin space. And it was the first time that I actually felt, Oh! Fuu this could be it. [11:54] And really, because Id seen that happen before with Liberty Dollar, and E-Gold, and bunch of other, more centralized digital currencies before that. So it was this sinking feeling, and I cried that day. I was very upset, I was like, Ive basically lost everything. I had no money on Mt. Gox, but I felt  this will kill Bitcoin. This could kill Bitcoin. And it didnt. And that really, really changed my perspective on how robust this system is.", "image": null}

I do remember what a time it was. Prior to this, its easy for people to come along now, and I guess a lot of people think theyve missed the boat. But, you know, Bitcoin shouldnt have succeeded.

Obviously a lot of people who used the exchange as a wallet lost their money. I think it was, at the time, something like three-quarters of a billion dollars. At a time when that was a very significant percentage of the total Bitcoin out there. One of the interesting things is, What can we extrapolate from that? Today a lot of people will say  and I hear this criticism all the time  that, if governments wanted to end Bitcoin, all they have to do is shut down the on-ramps and off-ramps. Make it very difficult to exchange, and that would kill Bitcoin. And part of my prior experience helps me with this, because I remember back with what happened with Mt. Gox: for a period of time, not only did we not have any exchanges, but we also lost a significant amount of Bitcoin that ended up being stolen. And it didnt kill Bitcoin then  when a single exchange was enough to effectively shut down all official channels for converting fiat to Bitcoin. And leaving only peer to peer mechanisms  exchanging cash, among others. Now, not only would you have to do that in a massive, global coordinated effort by world governments  because if you leave any of those doors open, everything just flows through there  now we also have stablecoins which allow us to deal with the other aspect which was problematic then, which is wire transfers of dollars. So we can flow enormous volume through these exchanges. And, even then it wouldnt work. People would revert to P2P. Yeah, it would stop the institutional investors, it would slow down our progress, it would hurt the price temporarily. But, if you realize, at that moment, that this wont actually kill it, you get two results: the first one is, any price decline you see, if you know its not gonna kill, you start thinking, Well, I mean, this might be an opportunity. We might be seeing something that is temporary, but doesnt change the long term valuation. In which case, you act on that. But the other thing is, you realize that, that result and that mentality changes the calculation upfront, which is: in order for this to work youd have to have concerted, massive coordination between world governments. But, if they knew that, in the end, there was a significant possibility that this wouldnt actually kill Bitcoin, and if they knew that trying but failing to kill it, ends up backfiring  because it feeds the narrative of This thing can survive even concerted action by national governments at a massive scale  well then they dont even try, because thats too dangerous to try. As they say, If youre gonna take a shot at the King, make sure you dont miss. [16:47] And this is exactly the case: every attempt to kill Bitcoin that fails, ends up inadvertently strengthening the narrative that it is not possible to kill this thing. So therefore, theres this strategic game that gets play at a meta-level, which is: its actually better not to try direct attacks like that, because if they fail, theyre worse than not trying at all.", "image": null}

And suddenly, we were on this boat with lots of people that were at the conference, and we heard these sirens happening, and we thought that everyone was coming, that this boat was gonna be pulled aside and we were all going to disappear in a prison in China. But then the boat just went straight past and everything carried. But the price corrected, and it had a couple of thousand points that came off the price at that stage. But then that went into a raging bull market and we had these industriesand what Ive seen is that every time, firstly  you talked about it  it has to be coordinated, because when one country does it, weve seen what happens. And the two trends that I saw as a result of that were (1) firstly, all of the volume went to Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. And Japanwho were the host of the exchange we talked about earlier  Mt. Gox, and another big one that got hacked, Coincheck, had been working a lot on their regulations of crypto-exchanges. And so, Chinathey allowed the mining industry to continue, but they banned the exchanges. Now the interesting thing about that is, if I were a government, and I was trying to collect lots of data, mining is: you put some fiat money in, you buy some machines and Bitcoins come out and they can go anywhere. But with exchanges, you gotta do all the Know Your Customer and youve gotta collect all the data. So what happened is that all of the data went to South Korean exchanges, Japanese exchanges, and Singapore exchanges. And China lost the data collection that they might have wanted. As we know, its a big agenda of governments to collect all of that data. The (2) second thing that happenedso, it just goes to another country, so then you have to have the coordinated effortbut the second thing is, you start to get the real innovation coming through, and that was when, it was after that, that this phrase DEX came around, decentralized exchange. Because, everyone starts figuring out, Well, how do you do this in the peer to peer? You know, everyone was doing this peer to peer, for example, if you had to go exchange cash, but then through technology, people started figuring out, How can we do that online? And the innovation just gets further and further and further. So if you start to seeright now, the big thing is DeFi  if there is a regulatory crackdown, which Im sure there will be, then people start to push the innovation further, and then other countries see the opportunities and start putting robust regulations that are centralized. So, to me it drives the centralized business somewhere else, and the drives the decentralized innovation as a result, and it just continues.", "image": null}

In order for centralized institutions  regulators, governments, etc.  to crack down or put a halt or slow down this system, they have to coordinate. And their coordination has to be near-perfect. I use another example about decentralization, the asymmetry of centralized versus decentralized systems, which is this: imagine your favorite super-band is having a concert at a stadium, and its a wonderful concert, everyone wants to be there, the ticket is $1000, and the stadium has 100 gates where you can enter, and 99 of those gates have a ticket-checking station, and check for tickets, and one of those gates is wide open and anyone can walk in. Simon, what is the ticket price for that concert?", "image": null}

Its free, because if you have one gate thats free, everybody goes through that gate! I mean there still might be some people who go through the other gates because theyve already paid for the ticket, maybe for convenience because its closer to the parking lot, but just like when you have these outdoor concerts and someone knocks one of the fences down and then you see a whole group of band fans going, Waaagh!, running through the fences through the fields, being chased by one or two elderly security guards in yellow vests, completely failing to stop the crowd. This is the asymmetry of centralized versus decentralized: in order to control a system like that, that operates on a centralized basis, you have to 100% block all the exits. Otherwise, if you let one exitand the switching costs between gates are zero  the bottom line is that youve failed. So a 1% failure in control, is entirely equivalent to a 100% failure in control. So, youve got centralized systems and centralized governments that have to coordinate perfectly, with no one stepping out of the game. And then you have a decentralized system that is reacting to these decisions. And the decentralized system doesnt have to succeed everywhere, it only has to succeed in one place, because this is virtual  because there is no switching cost  you just redirect all of the flows through that one place. [23:41] And you may lose some volume at first, but very quickly youre then going to focus the innovation on optimizing that path, and theres a very big monetary reward for those who optimize it. Its a bit like trying to build a dam and youve got the worlds best engineers and Im one dude with a little drill. You know? Great dam youve got there! But Ive got a hammer drill, so lets see who wins? I dont need to make the whole dam fall down. I only need to make a hole this big. Thats it! The water will do the rest. The water will take that tiny hole, and it will optimize its egress by making it wider and wider and wider until the dam is gone. So, money works that way! If you have a hole this big in the international system of financial controls and surveillance, which is exactly what Bitcoin is  its the pinprick  the small trickle that gets through actually funds the development and the innovation and the technology and the standing up of infrastructure to widen that hole. If youve got a country like Venezuela that has currency controls, and where the premium for Bitcoin is 30% above price, then whoever is able to send a trickle of Bitcoin into Venezuela and exchange it earns a 30% premium to use to expand their operations as fast as they can! And so that just makes the hole bigger! And this keeps repeating at every level. [25:26] So, decentralized versus centralized systems: the centralizers have to get everything right, the decentralized system only has to make a pinprick. That pinprick will actually self-fund its widening and the innovation, and the end result will be that you just break through the dam completely. And this has happened again and again and again with Bitcoin.", "image": null}

So, lets look at the coordinated effort scenario. I can imagine a world, especially where we are today, where IMF calls out for a Bretton Woods II already done. They sit down in a meeting, and it turns out that the whole world has complete ruined their fiscal and monetary policy  done. And they have to all sit around in a room, and they all coordinate a Facebook-style Libra monetary system using central bank digital currencies, and they decide on a global scale that theyre all gonna coordinate and implement some new global monetary system thats backed by a basket of all these different currencies. And then simultaneously they all agree that in order to opt in to this system, they all need to make Bitcoin illegal for use and purchase in their country. I think the only example we ever got of something like that was when the United States tried to make gold illegal so they could prevent hoarding, but weve never seen it on a global, coordinated scale. So while that is one of the risks that could happen, do you think Bitcoin could survive such a coordinated, centralized monetary system and do it with a kind of [inaudible]?", "image": null}

It would stop thriving  temporarily. And the reason for that is because, right now, a lot of the volume in Bitcoin is driven by those who can use other monetary systems, have access to the global economy, and choose to, voluntarily, use Bitcoin as a hedge, as a speculative instrument, as a placing, as a way to invest some future protocol. I mean, a lot of those people would obviously be discouraged by such regulations. It all comes down to where you think the primary economic value of the world economy lies. Does it lie in the fiat-denominated spreadsheets of investors and speculators operating in the markets? Are the markets the economy? The regulated, equity global markets, the currency markets? Is that the world economy? Or is the world economy a million papaya and banana stands on the sides of the roads, or taco trucks? Is the world economy the productive output of 7.5 billion humans trying to improve their own lot? I certainly believe its the latter. Which then means that, what exactly does that 7.5 billion mass of humanity have to lose, if the issue here is: I can either make a living, or follow the law. I either follow the law, and starve. Or break the law, and survive. Well, we know exactly how that equation works out, because we see it today in the global patterns of adoption of Bitcoin. In the adoption across the global south, where it is being used as a tool of survival. And for that population, if you had this global coordination, that would fail. So thats one aspect. But the other aspect is this: Great, so the IMF comes out and does this and they do this whole global coordination thing, and they try to shut down Bitcoin. Well, heres the thing: this is a bit like OPEC. This is a bit like cartel activity. And cartel activities work best when the market is very small, when the number of parties that have to coordinate is very small, and when the upside is very high. But what were talking about here is coordinating between a hundred different governments around the world in a very international system on something like money that is broadly used. Now, to me thats impossible. Because, any country that breaks ranks with the cartel, gains enormously through arbitrage. By saying, You know, thats cute what youre trying to do, but we think that if we actually go our own way and we enable on-ramps and off-ramps into and out of Bitcoin, in the first round, were going to get a lot of the people who are abandoning Bitcoin to come to us. And in the second round, were going to actually be able to grow substantially by being outside the system, because were outside the system already. China would do that, in my opinion. Almost immediately! They have no strategic advantage to signing on to a global system that is already dominated by the US and used for sanctions and geopolitical control, and hand them a new system thats that, minus any alternatives, competition, exits, or safety valves. Thats strategic suicide. And of course for the very same reasons, Russia wouldnt sign on to this. And what you end up doing is you have exactly the kind of split that we saw during the Cold War. You end up with a currency Cold War. And then you have a situation where there are basically two spheres of influence: theres the First World  you know, I dont know if you know this but the term Third World simply meant the unaligned nations  First World was the Western countries on the Cold War, Second World was the Eastern countries that were involved in the Cold War, and Third World, was just anyone who wasnt with either the Soviets or the Americans. It was about splitting the world into two spheres of influence. So if you end up doing that with currencies again, where you have the post-Bretton Woods international money system dominated by Western nations, and then you have the outsiders saying No!, dominated by China and Russia, which would end up taking most of Africa with them, a good chunk of South America, all of Southeast Asia, you then end up with two completely different spheres of the economy. Now lets think about this: they would not be allowed to talk to each other, right? Because theyre both closed systems. So thered be only one way to move value from one to the other, which would be a permissionless system. [33:16] In that case, Bitcoin actually becomes the rails for connecting the two spheres. So if you want to move money from the Sino-Soviet region of money to the Anglo region of money, the only rail that connects the two is Bitcoin. I mean, that, in my opinion, not only fails spectacularly but then it actually elevates Bitcoin to world reserve currency very very quickly  through neutrality. Neutrality becomes its leading factor. Both sides see that. If I have to choose between a system thats controlled by this set of countries that are not allied with me, or that set of countries that are not allied with me, how about I just choose a system thats not controlled by any country, so it doesnt matter if they are allied with me or not. Neutrality then becomes the winner, by default.", "image": null}

Lets look at mining. So firstly, lets not assume everyone knows what mining is. So, Bitcoin is backed by proof of work, and were about to get a large-scale experiment of one of the significant cryptocurrencies  Ethereum  switching from proof of work to proof of stake, so we actually get to see two cryptocurrencies that have adoption for their own use-cases, and we get to actually see in real time the infinite expectations of what happens with proof of work and proof of stake, assuming these two systems survive. But one of the big objections is the whole inefficiency of proof of work, and how bad it is for the environment, and how, if Bitcoin becomes as significant as it could be, it will consume so much electricity that it becomes this just completely clunky, inefficient network. What would you say about the proof of work andactually maybe just start with helping people understand the difference between proof of work, proof of stake and where you think these go?", "image": null}

Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/bitcoin-hardtalk-5-andreas-m-antonopoulos-simon-dixon-dont-buy-bitcoin-178dba365d77?source=user_profile---------40-------------------------------", "body": "Andreas Antonopoulos [36:18]: Yeah. Proof of work is about connecting currency to the ultimate form of value, which is energy. Everything we do on this planet is underwritten by energy. The food we eat is solar energy captured by photosynthesizing organisms, and then converted up a food chain into other forms of food. The heating in our homes, the ability to transport things around the planet, everything is energy. So in most currencies, the use of energy is mediated between the currency and the underlying energy by institutions that essentially change the exchange rate between energy and currency. So if you think about it, we just have a bigger chain for energy consumption: the US dollar is backed by energy, but instead of being backed directly by energy through proof of work, which is an efficient way of backing it by energy, you do it indirectly by energy. So you burn 100 million barrels of oil in order to wage war on lots of countries to control their oil reserves. You have all of the secondary effects, all of which ultimately consume a lot of energy, in fact in much more polluting ways, to do non-productive functions that act as a backing of the currency. [37:56] And, you know, if you call Bitcoin proof of work, I would call the US dollar proof of war. And that is the most polluting form of energy, and the least beneficial form of energy use we have on the planet. The military is the worst polluter in the country, and by extension in the world. So the idea that Bitcoin is inefficient misses the point, which is that proof of work is a mechanism for providing security in order to make the currency work, that does not have all of the intermediate forms of energy consumption in between the energy and the providing security. And so its a much more direct way of providing security for the currency, and unlike traditional currencies, where you dont get to choose where the energy will be consumed or how it will be produced, Bitcoin actually gravitates to places where energy is overproduced and under-consumed, where you have for most production systems that are not connected to distribution grids. Where you have developing nations that are moving fast and building new capacity without being able to distribute it. Where you have newly launched alternative energy systems: wind, solar, hydro, etc. That again, have overcapacity in production and do not yet have sufficient demand. And in all of those places, Bitcoin gravitates and provides a subsidy that reduces the unit cost of electric production for those systems of energy. So essentially, its a subsidy system for solar, wind, hydro, and alternative energy, in places where that development is needed the most. And weve seen that in practice. This is not just a speculative thing. Weve seen that thats exactly how Bitcoin mining gravitates towards those sources of energy. Now, proof of work is one mechanism of doing it, proof of stake is a different mechanism of doing it, and they have different pros and cons. Theyre not exactly substitute mechanisms. Theyre not equivalent. What you can do with proof of work is not the same as what you can do with proof of stake. [40:32] Proof of work actually provides you with historical immutability, the ability to cement the past in a way that it cannot be changed, which is incredibly important for a very robust currency. Proof of work also gives you something else, which is that it allows you to bootstrap a currency without a prior distribution mechanism. You see, the thing is, with proof of stake, and let me explain proof of stake briefly  proof of stake is where, instead of using energy to back the currency, you use the currency by putting down a bond that you will do the security verification for every new transaction that happens. And if you fulfill your promise and do the security correctly, you get a slight reward  you earn some interest essentially. Its a bit like using a certificate of deposit or investing in a bond and generation some yield as you maintain the security of the system through audits. So youre putting down an auditing bond, youre then auditing the system, and if you audit it successfully according to everybody elses expectation, then you earn a bit of reward. If you audit it incorrectly, then you lose some of your principal. Heres the thing: in order to do proof of stake, you need to have the currency that is going to be used to stake already distributed. And of course, in order to do proof of stake fairlywhere you dont have one person or group of people seize control from the very beginning  you have to have a fairly broad distribution of the currency before you start proof of stake. Well that creates a bit of a chicken and egg problem. You cant bootstrap a proof of stake system ab initio. You cant have a virgin birth of a proof of stake system, because, essentially, all of the control is in one group. [42:28] Which is why many proof of stake systems actually bootstrap as proof of work. Proof of work allows you to do a virgin birth, like we had with Bitcoin. You bootstrap it, the proof of work uses a mechanism to distribute the currency based on competition of resources. But heres the interesting thing: once youve done that, you can actually switch to proof of stake if you want to! Ironically, the efforts to perfect proof of stake, to improve, to test at bigger and bigger scale, to put under adversarial trial proof of stake systemsin Ethereum  is actually an enormous safety mechanism for Bitcoin. And Bitcoins proof of work and immutability is an enormous safety mechanism for proof of stake systems. Allow me to explain. One of the difficulties a proof of stake system has is it cannot safeguard the immutability of the past. Theres a type of attack against proof of stake systems called a long-range attack, where, essentially what you can do is you can re-write the past beyond a certain depth for zero cost. Because theres no way to prove that that past is immutable. In a proof of work system, if youve used the energy and then you try to recalculate the past, you have to re-expend the same amount of energy, theres no shortcut, you cant do it without proving the proof of work. So if you spent gigawatts to get to today, and you wanted to re-write the past, youd have to spend those gigawatts again to re-write it. And that preserves the past very robustly, because, of course, you only get rewarded once, but you expend the energy twice if you try to re-write the past. In proof of stake you cant do that, but you could take proof of stake checkpoints and embed them in a proof of work blockchain that gives you the robust protection of the past and therefore safeguards your proof of stake blockchain from long-range attacks. You can use the proof of work blockchain as an oracle that gives you check-pointing. In fact, a number of chains already do that with Bitcoin. But heres the other way it works: the key scenario that most people are worried about is: the miners get shut down. Somehow, a government coerces all of the miners into shutting down their operations, or seizes their operations, or takes over and forces them to censor transactions, or whatever. And we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot guarantee that 51% of the mining is in honest hands, which is the prerequisite for maintaining a proof of work chain. Well, there are a number of things that can be done at that point. There can be proof of authority overlays, where you basically say, These miners have acted improperly in the past, were not going to accept them. Were going to vet some of the miners and sign their blocks and only accept those. Tricky to do. But heres a thought of how we could actually fix this in Bitcoin, which would be to switch to proof of stake, perhaps temporarily, perhaps long-term. You take out all the miners, we switch to proof of stake. The funny thing is that, Bitcoins already been distributed. So weve already solved the virgin birth problem. We already have Bitcoin holders, who have in their best interest to maintain the honesty of the chain, which means that those people staking their Bitcoin would actually protect the system against proof of work attacks. The thing is, you dont need to implement that solution for it to be an effective counter-measure. Simply the fact that you can means that an attack against miners is ultimately a failed attack. It involves hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of dollars, in infrastructure, if youre gonna do a 51% attack. Or it involves expending enormous and strategic capital to compromise and coerce the miners in your state, and then ultimately what that results in is someone nuking your strategic Bitcoin infrastructure from under your feet, and kicking you off the position of power that you had, and now just lost. To achieve what, exactly? Nothing! So, the mere existence of a counter-measure acts to prevent this attack. [47:32] This is a bit like Chekhovs gun: if you see a gun on the mantle-piece in Act I of a play, someones gonna get shot in Act III. The presence of that thing signals what comes next. The fact that we have more than one effective consensus algorithm now prevents an attack against consensus algorithms. Does that make sense?", "image": null}

Yep! So I guess, summarizing that mining centralization argument is a big thing. People always are concerned. Originally, you could fire up a laptop and you could use your computer power to mine Bitcoin. Then it moved to more complex graphic cards, and then it moved to specific machines, and now its institutionalized. Firstly, when people say that about 65% of mining happens in China, is that something that actually is true and can be verified? And do you see a scenario where the Chinese government nationalizes all that mining power and Bitcoin becomes Chinacoin?", "image": null}
{"title": "Bitcoin HARDTalk #5 \u2014 Andreas M. Antonopoulos & Simon Dixon: Don\u2019t Buy Bitcoin!", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/bitcoin-hardtalk-5-andreas-m-antonopoulos-simon-dixon-dont-buy-bitcoin-178dba365d77?source=user_profile---------40-------------------------------", "body": "Andreas Antonopoulos: So, first of all, theres no way to actually verify that. People make a gross simplification in most of these arguments. What they say is, 70% of the mining pools are concentrated in China, and then they equate mining pools with mining power, and thats absolutely not the case. Mining pools are concordia of mining power that concentrate the activity of mining, but they dont physically exist anywhere. So you can participate with your mining power in any mining pool you want, and most importantly the switching cost of moving from one mining pool to another is zero. So if someone takes over a mining pool and you dont like how theyre operating, you just switch mining pools, and thats it! And the mining power drains enormously fast. Weve seen this happen several times in Bitcoins past, where a mining pool has acted suspiciously, or even a rumor has been started that a mining pool might act suspiciously, and the mining power in that pool evaporates overnight, like 95% drop in power overnight. So we know that 70% of the hashrate that presents for mining pools is through mining pools that we see are located in China, because we can identify the location of mining pools. But we dont know where the actual mining power is. Theres good reason to believe that a chunk of it is in China, probably more than 50%, possibly as big as 70%, but we dont know that. Thats also not to say that you dont have pools of mining power that exist in other countries, or that you might not have pools of mining power that can be brought up rather quickly in other countries. The long-term trend has been one of decentralization of mining power. So if you think about it from a numbers perspective, in 2009 there was one miner who had 100% of the hashpower  Satoshi. And that was the most centralized mining weve ever had, but it didnt matter, because the rule here is that more than 51% must be in honest hands. It doesnt matter in this case  one set of hands  as long as that was honest, it worked. And then it was two, and then it was three, and now we have thousands of miners with machines all around the world. Some estimates in terms of the actual machines is that were looking at more than 2 million pieces of hardware devices that are mining. And so from that perspective its decentralized, even within China  I mean China is an enormous country, with a lot of very remote, rural areas where various kinds of deals with local officials generating enormous revenue through the back door are enabled through these mining functions, even if the Chinese government decided, Lets take down all the miners, this is the conversation I imagine: Hello? Central Party? Yes. Uh, we should do what? Shut down all the miners in our province? Oh. We dont have any miners in our province. Oh, you found some? We will shut them down immediately. Guys, shut it down for an hour. You know? The problem here is thatyes, okay, China has very very strong controls so that they can expand and extend very strongly all across the country, but were talking about money here. And in a centralized system like that where the rule of law is so weak, money has an incredible corrupting influencethe amount of bribes that can be marshaled off of a Bitcoin mine to every layer of official within that area. So, yes its possible to shut them all down, but China would want to do that in a very draconian fashion, which of course they might decide to do. But you have to ask Why would they do that? What would they gain exactly? And the truth is that right now, it serves them better to keep that in their back pocket, than basically push the entire industry to the United States and other Western nations, with no hope of seeing it return to their shores ever again, for no reason! It doesnt really give them any advantage. The final thing is to understand that, taking control of the miners doesnt allow you to break the rules. If you have control of all of the mining, you still cant spend Bitcoin that isnt yours. You still cant take all of the Bitcoin. You still cant make transactions pay different people. You can stop the network  thats it! And so, in order to do this kind of attack, you have to have one and only one goal, and that is to stop the network. And then it goes into the idea of, if you do that, and you fail to stop the network, what have you proven? Youve proven that its not stoppable. So theres a very, very big risk in failure there, again as in many attack vectors on Bitcoin. [54:33] That doesnt mean that Chinas not gonna do this  they might. And this might end up wounding Bitcoin severely and setting it back by years. But I am not of the mind that the development community and the rest of the ecosystem in Bitcoin will simply sit back, let that happen, take no counter-measures whatsoever, and not come back with a torrent of innovation. In fact, quite the opposite. I think that triggers a defense response, which leads me to my final thought on this category of problems, which is: we have to think about this in terms of evolution. This is not a single system battling another single system. This is millions of independent agents in various governments, regulators, and countries, battling millions of individuals with their systems that are dispersed around the world  software programmers, miners, users, wallets, exchange operators, who have their own interest, right? So if you think about these as two giant populations and you think about them engaging in some kind of battle, then if the predators in that environment create a new attack that finds a vulnerability in the prey, what we know from nature is that that creates an evolutionary response. And what happens when you attack a prey animal is  depends! Take a look at Australia. You can see there what happens when you have a lot of animals in a very harsh and hostile environment. They become scaly-armored, venomous and poisonous things, so that eventually there are very few cuddly critters in the country, and almost everything can kill you. My theory is this: right now Bitcoin is a gecko. If you start stomping on all the little geckos, you trigger an evolutionary response, and the gecko starts getting bigger, sturdier, scalier, poisonous, angry, and reactive, and what you end up doing is you drive evolution to a Komodo dragon. And if you try to step on a Komodo dragon, it will bite your foot off. So if the governments of the world decide to try an attack like that on Bitcoin, they will drive an evolutionary response, at the protocol level, at the user-interface level, that will make the system stealthy, reactive, evasive, and vicious in response. And that will actually make it unstoppable.", "image": null}

That is not the same as taking down Bitcoin, however. And that is due to a number of innovations that exist in Bitcoin. So first of all, ellptic curve cryptography that is used in Bitcoin is susceptible to quantum analysis  cryptanalysis. Meaning that, if you have an elliptic curve public key, you cant get the private key, because thats the mathematical equivalent of doing division in the elliptic curve domain which is not possible. You would have to try every possible private key in order to find the one that gives you that public key, also known as a brute force attack in the classical computing environment. Therefore, you cant take a public key, and find the corresponding private key, or take a digital signature and find the corresponding private key. With a quantum computer, however, you can, as long as you have a quantum computer that can actually do calculations at 256 qubits  actually, I think its only 128 because of the nature of quantum cryptanalysis, but you need a lot of qubits. Were nowhere near getting that many qubits, but lets say theoretically you did have a computer like that. Well, you could go on the Bitcoin blockchain and you could find any transaction that has a digital signature or public key in it, and you could find the corresponding private key. Now, heres the interesting thing: digital signatures of public keys dont appear in Bitcoin until you spend. When you receive Bitcoin, you receive it to an address which is a double-hash. And the public key and digital signature isnt shown until you spend. So if youre not re-using Bitcoin addresses, if every time you do a transaction, you use a new address, and if any time you sign for an address, you spend everything thats in that address and send the change to a new address, when Ive shown you my public key and my signature, its to a private key that no longer controls money, because the reason you saw it is because I just spend it all from there. Which actually really narrows the focus of such an attack. Youd only be able to do it against keys that been re-used. Quantum computing would also not be very effective for breaking SHA-256. So, thats a whole different domain of problems  is doing a preimage attack on a hash algorithm. Theres no indication that you can really accelerate that with a quantum computer. As far as I know there are no good algorithms that can do that. So, money in re-used keys would be vulnerable, but at the same time, thats not the end of Bitcoin, because we can change the signature algorithm. So we can change to a quantum-resistant signature algorithm, and then its resistant to quantum computers. In fact, if quantum computing is widespread, if I can have it in my ThinkPad, then I can use a quantum digital signature that cannot be broken by a quantum computer. If I can sign with a quantum computer then you cant break it with a quantum computer. So we just upgrade everything to quantum-capable systems. The bottom line is that if you think of Bitcoin as a completely static system, where everybody publishes all of their digital signatures yes, thats vulnerable to a quantum computer. But thats not what Bitcoin is! Its a system where we dont publish our signatures until we empty an address, for the most part. And then its also a system that can evolve, we can change the signature algorithm. In fact, the very next upgrade in Bitcoin that is being planned right now  its called Taproot  its a collection of changes that is being planned for 2021 introduction into the Bitcoin code base, [that] includes a new signature algorithm called Schnorr signatures. The fact that we can go from elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), to Schnorr signatures and have both of those systems work in parallel, simply demonstrate the fact that we could also have another, and a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth signature algorithm all co-existing. And we can evolve them over time. So, as long as the system continues to evolve and as long as quantum computers are not capable of doing the amount of qubits that are needed to break our key lengths, we are not only safe, but we can stay ahead of this game.", "image": null}

All of encryption breaks if you have a quantum computer. Which, interestingly enough, then makes this the most important secret in the world. And, its the one that you keep dry until you need it. So lets say for example that the NSA created a quantum computer with enough qubit capacity to break other governments communication secrets. Well, at that point you dont want to use it. And if you do use it, you want to have the ability to do whats called parallel construction. Meaning that, you need to have a cover story. So if someone says, Hang on a second. It appears they know that we were going to be in the Red Square at noon exchanging this diplomatic envelope. Did they break our communications? No, probably not. They probably got it by beating up Yuri last week. You need an other story thats more plausible than, They have a quantum computer that can read all of our messages. We actually have a historical parallel to this: between 1941 and 1944, the Allies broke Enigma, the German, the Axis encryption computer machine that was being used by Germans to control submarine fleets, to communicate about air raids, etc. They broke this in England at a place called Bletchley Park under the leadership of Alan Turing, the father of computer science. And then this became the most important secret in the war, because they could now read the German communications  not immediately, not all of them, but enough and fast enough that they could actually take action. So they had to then construct a complete intelligence system that ensured that for every lead that they followed, they had a cover story that gave a better explanation than, Enigma is broken, so that the Germans wouldnt stop using the Enigma machine. And in fact theres a specific example in the war when the Allies found out that Coventry was about to be bombed with one of the biggest raids in the war, and they had the choice between preventing possibly tens of thousands of deaths in the city of Coventry, and revealing  and they didnt have a good cover story. And so they decided to let the Germans bomb Coventry and not warn anyone. So, Bitcoin is the attack that doesnt have a good cover story. You start seeing coins from years ago moving that nobody thinks anyone can break the keys  the idea starts growing in your mind that maybe someone out there has a quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA. Which then creates a worldwide scramble to migrate away from quantum vulnerable encryption systems, and it complete de-fangs that very important intelligence tool. So if someone had such a tool or is able to build such a tool, more likely, over the next 15 years, they would be very smart not to use it on Bitcoin, and instead to keep it, and hold it, and to pretend that such a thing doesnt exist, and to use it only under dire circumstances.", "image": null}

And weve seen claims that certain developers from within an organization like Blockstream  when they have more influence over the Bitcoin code, and that you could have a corporate takeover.

I read GitHub blogs. I follow  not all  but many of the conversations that are happening on the developer mailing list, in the developer IRC, and in the GitHub pull requests, which are the requests for changes that are happening and publicly discussed. And you can read the code and see what exactly is being changed, how, and why? There is a very, very small possibility that someone could sneak a code change in there that has an unintended side effect that is not immediately obvious. But again, this is a decentralized system, so you change the code of Bitcoin Core  does that change the security of wallets that dont depend on Bitcoin Core? Nope! So there is no central piece of code that is used everywhere in Bitcoin, other than the mining functions. The core consensus algorithms which are very, very, very carefully scrutinized, and of course, even there, people dont only run one code base. They run a couple of different code bases, theyre very slow to upgrade, and they take their time to make sure there are no problems, not because theyre expecting back doors, but because they expect bugs that inevitably happen. And if you lose money because of a bug, it doesnt hurt or sting any less or more than losing it through a back door. So open source code creates an environment in which it is very difficult to introduce changes. The ecosystem around Bitcoin uses a variety of code bases at different levels within the application stack, and theyre written independently in differently languages by different people, and theyre all scrutinizing the main rules that run in consensus and interacting with them and running a barrage of programming tests on those rules to know if something has changed thats going to affect their software. So, can a programmer introduce a back door? Not really. And theyd have to introduce it in a way to goes unnoticed, and spreads widely, and then gets adopted by multiple stacks, and then can be executed in such a way that causes widespread damage that cant be fixed by patching or even rolling back the chain. Thats a lot of ifs. And so if you think about it from a probability perspective, the probability of the first thing happening is 10%, the probability of the second thing happening is 10%, so 10% times 10% is 1%  the probability of the third thing happening  so you have an exponential decay of probability with every step that you add to this chain. This is why conspiracy theories dont work. Its because the probabilities multiply in a way that exponentially decreases the chance of it succeeding. [01:11:49] So, no, you cant do that. On the other hand, can you create an environment in which development is hijacked in such a way that others cant develop alternative paths or follow alternative attempts to develop the code or disagree with big decisions. I think that was answered conclusively in August of 2017. And the answer is, that although development teams can build their own, and can fork off from Bitcoin, and then can solicit the businesses, the owners, the wallets, the exchanges, etc., to follow their version. Now, youre gonna hear a lot of people say, but censorship and bullying prevented this from succeeding, and I dont believe that, because when Bitcoin started, nobody believed in it, it was absolutely censored everywhere, there was plenty of bullying from major financial circles, and yet Bitcoin did succeed, because it could succeed on the merits. And I would argue that alternative teams that have tried to implement changes to the Bitcoin code, have failed on the merits, because they have failed to maintain it, to develop features that people actually want, to follow the conservative ethos that the market is demonstrating through its choices whether you agree with it or not, and have failed to appeal to the businesses, and the users in the ecosystem to follow them. But, if it was in fact the case, that the developers tried to pull a coup, where they try to push changes or prevent changes that were broadly desired  they would fail on the merits. Other people could very easily bootstrap that code, run it independently with the changes that they want, and maintain it by attracting the best talent in the space. And, you know, we can talk about all of the conspiracies for why that happened for some of the forks for Bitcoin. But the bottom line is that that represents a supreme lack of faith in the ability of the market to discern the merits of different solutions. And I trust the market, bottom line. There is no amount of censorship that could make a solution that is inferior and peer to peer. Not over the long term.", "image": null}

I think its extremely unlikely. Honestly, we dont know if Satoshi is still alive, quite honestly. And we certainly dont know if they still have control and access to the keys in order to use them. This is unknown. An unknown doesnt mean that I think theyre not alive, or I think they dont have control. It really does mean unknown, they might, they might not, there is zero possibility of going one way or another, because we dont have the information to make that determination. So, from that perspective, there is a possibility, but that possibility gets slimmer with time, meaning that, Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared since 2010 and none of the Bitcoin has ever moved. 10 years later, that fact, not only hasnt changed, but its had 10 years piled on top of it. So if you follow the general logic year, every year that passes cements the probability that theyre not going to move. If they did move, it would be a shock to the system, for sure. It would be a shock to the system because it would demonstrate one of two possibilities: one, that Satoshi Nakamotos keys have been accessed, and someone controls them and is able to move, either Satoshi themselves, or somebody who managed to get access to those keys, inherit TXs to those keys, find those keys, whatever. The second possibility, ironically, goes back to the previous discussion that we had, which is that a quantum computer has cracked those keys. Especially with some of the early keys, they are paid to public keys so the public key is visible, and the moneys sitting in them. So, therefore, a quantum computer, its first target, its juiciest target, its easiest to attack target, is the Satoshi stash. So, how do we know if a quantum computer exists that can break ECDSA? Simple! Satoshis coins start moving. In fact at some point after a decade or so, it might actually be the more likely explanation. So you see the coins moving and youre like, Did Satoshi come back from the dead? Or, did a quantum computer emerge that can break these? As the years go by, I start leaning more towards, Okay, it appears that a quantum computer has emerged that can do this. But I think were still a decade away from that. It would cause a massive amount of volatility in the space by injecting an enormous amount of liquidity on the supply side of Bitcoin. But it would also once and for all resolve the question, and so you probably knowI think this is characteristic of markets  which is, whats the thing? Sell the rumor, buy the fact? The fact that theres uncertainty, can cause a lot of volatility. Something starts happening, but its unexpected. The markets react badly. But as soon as that becomes expected, you get the opposite reaction. The markets go, Oh, well, I guess Satoshis coins moved. Bitcoin didnt die completely, its price dipped. Well now, Bitcoin, at whatever price its priced in now, is a Bitcoin in which Satoshis coins have moved, and are therefore part of the supply and priced in. Therefore, its future is now certain. That is no longer hanging over it. Which, usually, traders react to very optimistically at that point, because you remove that big chunk of uncertainty. Sometimes, having the bad news confirmed, leads to a rally in the markets, because you went from uncertainty, to confirmation, even though whats being confirmed is bad news.", "image": null}

The biggest risk in Bitcoin is that people who are in Bitcoin already, forget why we got into it, and get seduced by the possibility of riches to sell out all of the principles that make Bitcoin special, and basically hand the baton to something that replaces Bitcoin because it actually achieves the principles that Bitcoin espouses more effectively. We give up on privacy, fungibility, censorship resistance, neutrality, borderless operation, open access, limited monetary supply. We start giving up on those principles one by one, compromising and turning Bitcoin into more and more and more of a Disney version of Bitcoin, right? We polish the rough edges, we take off the sharp corners, we make it more palatable to the investors, we make it more suitable for PayPal to do KYC, we introduce controls so that the IMF if more comfortable with it, we make it so that they are more and more comfortable with it, which makes it less and less effective. Bitcoin doesnt get attacked if it doesnt threaten anything. So one way to stop it from getting attacked is to make it completely unthreatening, by removing its fangs, by disarming it, by making it useless. And that can only happen from the inside. That can only happen by capitulation of the principles by those who are invested in it, and who decide that, in the end this wasnt about creating a system where we dont have rulers. In the end this wasnt about creating a system without intermediaries. In the end it was simply about replacing the corrupt intermediaries, rulers, and controllers of the past, with me, you, or whoever else, because thats greed, right? And so, when people say, how about we just make me in charge, and then we dont need to worry about not having anyone in charge? Thats how these systems fail. Honestly at this point, given the fact that the recipe of Bitcoin, the concept, its implications, and the ideas and principles behind it have become so widespread and so easy to replicate, I think that that kills Bitcoin, but it doesnt kill the movement that Bitcoin started. If the community capiulates its principles, all that will do is, theyll get replaced by a system that doesnt capitulate those principles. Some other system manages to be more principled than Bitcoin and becomes the new Bitcoin. And in many ways, as Ive said before, there is a strong possibility at that point that we simply name this new system Bitcoin, and pretend that nothing changed. The brand itself might survive the instance of the technology, if it still carries the principles.", "image": null}

So I was a junior in high school, and I was reading about Libertarianism I came across this Austrian economics website called mises.org. And I subscribed to their newsletter [01:41] and so I would get this in my inbox, and one of the topics they would talk about is the business cycle. And the business cycle is a macroeconomic phenomenon that the Austrian school has done research on long before the global financial crisis in 2008. There was a lot of research done on what causes instability in the financial system and really the conclusion I came to from reading the material they were putting out was that its a combination of fractional reserve banking and central banking that causes the business cycle to happen. And the only solution to that is to take the power of the printing press out of the hands of the government, out of the hands of central authorities. And the closest, the least-worst solution, in my mind, was 100% reserve banking with gold. And thats kind of where I was at probably around 2006. And even before I learned about Bitcoin, or before it existed, I did theorize about, hypothetically, one could have a money with an absolutely fixed supply. [02:51] And that that would actually be better than gold, because people produce gold every day. But I wasnt a computer scientist or anything. So in college I majored in Accounting, I started my career at Deloitte doing audits of mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and all that stuff. Crazy fiat finance stuff. In any case, I learned about Bitcoin twice: the first time I heard about it was on Slashdot, so I was already, even in high school, when I was learning about Libertarianism, I was also learning about open source software, and learning how to install Linux on my computer, listening to Richard Stallman lectures about how free software is great for users.", "image": null}

I had a few friends but it was pretty much just me on the Internet trying to figure out whats going on in the world. The other thing is that, from moving between France and the US, I think that I became kind of political in the sense that I saw how people could have radically different views of what makes the economy run.

And that they wanted to create an aristocratic ruling class that could directly tax the people in the United States, and also issue bonds and benefit the commercial interests of financiers and people like Alexander Hamilton that we make musicals about being heroes today, but that there was kind of an underlying profit motive to the whole operation. And also that they aggressively used fake news in order to give the colonists the impression that there were Deep State conspiracies in London afoot. And that the king was made out to be  its kind of like if Alex Jones took over the mainstream media, right? And he started putting in place this mind virus of, Hey, guess what? King George is going to take all of our liberties away, and every single thing he does is a frog boiling in the pot. Whereas, the historians look at what conversations are going on in Parliament and in King Georges cabinet, and its just a completely different story. That, in reality, they were just trying to figure out how to balance the finances of this empire, and keep enemies at bay, and kind of just keep everyone happy. Its not like they were out to get anyone. Its like, if you went to Afghanistan today, the Afghanis probably have misconceptions about why the United States is there, and what their true intent is, right? [07:46] They probably think that, like, Theyre here to steal our minerals, theyre here to steal our resources, theyre here to grow drugs. And maybe some of that is going on, but fundamentally the political motive is, We got attacked on 9/11, and then we can  we dont have to go into CIA blowback in Saudia Arabia and all that. So thats my more nuanced view. But again, I have no way of verifying this, right? I cant run an American Revolutionary War full node and download the history of it and verify it.", "image": null}

So that just excludes the possibility of a state. And so I do take that proposition seriously. Now the secondary question is, Ok, How would that be enforceable? How would we prevent the state from committing acts of aggression? Because, ultimately, whoever is strongest is gonna be able to assert and defend their rights. And, if we look at human history there was a turning point when we had firearms. Thats when we actually were able to have rights that were enforceable by the citizenry against the warrior class in society. Because now, even a female who is very weak, or a male who is very weak  I dont wanna be sexist, is able to own a firearm and level the playing field with someone who wields a broadsword, or has a giant axe. And that was kind of a huge deal in human development. And so that technology leveled the playing field. And now, obviously, there are people trying to undo that because what happens when you have broad ownership of firearms is that, theres negative externalities of crime, but theres also positive externalities of  theres going to be limits to state power, and you cant just go full totalitarian, communist Chinese surveillance state. Conceivably  I dont know, well see. We can argue about the NSA or whatever. [19:03] So theres that technology, and so from that insight of  the less it costs for individuals to defend themselves from aggression, then the less aggression theres going to be. And so I think it actually goes even further into  now, in the Digital Age, where cameras are a big part of that, so phones that have cameras on them. I think phones with cameras on them are going to reduce the amount of violence inflicted by, for example, police officers, right? So Rodney King  Rodney King happened way worse, lots more times before there was video, before the invention of video, and before the costs of video came down low enough that you could have a helicopter with video. And so theres so many parts to this, right? And its kind of the same thing actually during the Civil Rights movement. When video came out of white police officers using dogs against black protesters, and using hoses against peaceful black protesters, this actually shocked the nation, right? That, Wait, hold on, these people are just marching in the street, why are you attacking them unprovoked? Thats completely unacceptable. They have first amendment rights, you cant just attack people like this. And if it was white people on the receiving end of it, it would just not stand, right? So I do think that technology has a huge influence on our ability to assert rights, both in terms of kinetic  shooting a bullet, but also in terms of psychological warfare and mass media and the ability to publicize abuse and whatnot. Now, okay, so lets take it to cryptography and Bitcoin. Well, so we can apply this concept to gold as well. Alright, Im going on a wild tangent here because were talking about anarcho-capitalism, but basically the idea is that I think that the technological progress is going to allow us to reach an anarcho-capitalist society, where we no longer actually need the state to enforce property rights, because well have autonomous robots that will physically remove you from the property if you invade someones home.", "image": null}

Right now Id like to jump intolike, if you could lay out your case for the Bitcoin investment thesis? I know youre an expert on the investment case for Bitcoin. Maybe a little bit  guide it for a pre-coiner or a new-coiner? And right off the bat, I love your Tweet about, Bitcoin is savings technology. I think its brilliant! One of the things I run into there though is, unfortunately, most people dont have a lot of savings. [22:53] And what savings they do have is maybe in their 401(k), so its not really liquid or tappable. Its not true savings  its an investment. And its hard to turn someone on, you know, when you talk about maybe DCA or $10 a week. I tell people, Buy two Starbucks worth a week.

So I think that Bitcoin is going through this process of going from having zero value to having all of the monetary value in the world. So then we can think about Where is the monetary value currently? And Why is that monetary value going to transfer to Bitcoin? So where it is currently is primarily in US dollars, and US dollar-denominated government debt (treasuries). After gold, the US dollar was able to become the world reserve currency. And so, today, the entire international monetary system and international financial system is centered around the dollar. Everything from: having contracts be dollar-denominated, to, the most liquid equities and derivatives exchanges are all in the US and in dollar and all of that. Basically, the reason you end up with a world reserve currency  and before, it was gold in various forms  is that the whole point of a money is that people dont have to barter. And so you have one singular asset that is the most liquid asset that people are going to use for what economists call indirect exchange. Where, its not so much that Im trading with you because I need what you have, its: Im trading with you because I need money that Im going to then go spend somewhere else with someone who has what I need. So indirect exchangein the free market process  one good is going to reach the top of the liquidity stack. So its gonna have to have certain properties. I would argue that the most important property that it would have is that itd have some form of verifiable scarcity. So why is that? Well, with a medium of exchange, you dont really want an abundant amount of it, otherwise its not going to hold any value because people are just going to create more of it. [25:41] Whereas, with a commodity, you kind of want an infinite amount of it  ideally, we would have an infinite amount of oil, right? We dont want scarce oil, right? In fact, were concerned about peak oil. Were concerned about scarce oil, its a problem for civilization. We can talk about global warming, but thats a different conversation. Whereas, with a money, we would be concerned about too much money being created and inflation, whereas with too little money being created  now we can debate this, because Keynesians think that thats a problem  of deflation, of prices going down. In any case, if we go back to gold versus the dollar and verifiable scarcity, the dollar combined two technologies which allowed it to have better verifiable scarcity than gold. The first one was paper money that actually could not be counterfeited, or where the cost of counterfeiting that paper money was greater than the actual value of the money itself. The cost of making a perfect replica of a $100 bill is greater than a hundred dollars. [26:53] And that cost includes the risk of getting caught and being put in prison! So theres definitelythe ability to have rule of law, and to have nobody be above the law, enforces the US dollars verifiable scarcity. The other part of the equation was the emergence of an institutional technology called independent central banking. Before independent central banking, you had central banks that were either fully controlled by the commercial system  by banks  or they were fully controlled by the sovereign  by the government, or by the prince, or by the Roman emperor  we can go that far back. But you didnt have an independent central bank in the Roman Empire or anything like that, and so they would get themselves in trouble where they would start out with having a gold coin, and then they would start diluting it, and what they would do is they monopolized mints  they nationalized the mints, because the mints provide the verification technology in gold. Its way too expensive to take gold nuggets and to verify that theyre pure gold, right? You have to standardize the gold using a minting technology  and mints used to be private, where it was like a brand like Kelloggs or whatever  but governments took it over because they understood strategically, if you want to pay for the war machine, its nice to have access to a mint. [28:32] And its nice to be able to dilute things out and to pay your troops with diluted coin and all this. In any case, that verification technology was easily co-opted. Now, lets contrast all these with Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, you run your software on your computer that does this verification. So, you dont have to trust a mint, you dont have to trust a government, and you dont have to trust an independent central bank, and you dont have to trust a counterfeit bill detector. All you have to trust is the developers  and you dont even really have to trust them either, because its open-source. So if you have the software development chops, you can go and audit the code yourself and look things over, or, write the code yourself, right? People have done that, theyve written their own implementation of a Bitcoin node. So you dont even really have to trust anyone, at the end of the day. Some people say you have to trust Intel, because were all running this on Intel processors. [29:25] We can go down that rabbit hole if you want.", "image": null}

So, to seize it  one of the interesting things is that, if you ever look at the different between a bank account and Bitcoin, its that the government can very easily seize a bank account. And the reason they can do that is because our constitutional protections around due process and arbitrary search and seizure have been undermined over the past decades by efforts from progressives and from the IRS and from law enforcement and from prosecutors, to undermine our rights. And so now, a bank account no longer has the constitutional protections that your home safe has. So if you keep gold or if you keep $100 bills in your safe, in your house, it has more legal protections to it than if you keep your dollars in a bank account with a third party. And that should not be the case, right? Theres no reason for that to be the case, other than the Supreme Court being corrupted, frankly, by fiat law. In any case  because its not like the Constitution has been amended, right? Theres no constitutional amendment that says, The government now has a right to seize your bank account. It really is just that  they see it as, Well, in order to collect taxes, we have to do this! And the Constitution says that were supposed to collect taxes, so were gonna have to do this. [31:47] Now, they know that they cannot extend that logic to your house. So if they want to seize cash thats in a safe, they have to go get a warrant and be able to prove things out that they have probably cause and all of this. They cant just do civil asset forfeiture and barge into your house like they do with the drug war  we could talk about that. So all this to say that the cost of seizing Bitcoin  so lets say they could, right? That they are able to do that, like they do with drugs. So they can barge into anyones house, and, without respecting due process or private property, they can assault people, they can kill dogs, they can accidentally shoot your wife, they can kill people, light houses on fire  they do this regularly as part of the war on drugs, with zero accountability, because they have sovereign immunity. [32:51] So these agents of the government are completely unaccountable and irresponsible in their day to day actions, committing gross negligence left and right, destroying property, and so you could argue, Well, okay, this is already going on for drugs, so it could happen for Bitcoin  thats entirely valid. So thats why I think the Second Amendment is so important. Ultimately, the only person who could defend your private property is yourself, because the people assaulting you might be agents of the state, or they might be criminals who present themselves as agents of the state. You have no way of verifying that, when someone assaults you and says that theyre police, how are you gonna know that they actually are police? And this happens all the time where criminals will literally wear police badges and impersonate police, and thats why they have to make police impersonation illegal in the first place, right? Because criminals do this. Now the problem is that, criminals are already criminals. They dont care about adding on a few charges of police impersonation  theyre already assaulting you, they might already be about to murder you, so they dont really care about getting another charge on their rap sheet. So its kind of a ridiculous situation. [34:03] And we saw this play out with Breonna Taylor  I dont know if you read about this story?", "image": null}

So already its like, Why? Why are you guys doing that? Theres no reason to be doing that. The number one drug dealer in the US is Big Pharma. Theyre the ones who are pushing opiates onto people, and then the tax-payers are paying for all of these opiates, so its pretty crazy that the government thinks it has any kind of moral high ground on this topic. But anyways, theyre searching for drugs, I guess, maybe theyre anti-competition, right? Theyre trying to prevent competition with Big Pharma. And, you know, these are white police officers. To them, theyre kind of in a foreign country when they go and attack drug dealers, and attack their families. [34:57] Theyre an occupying force, and thats why you see them wear military fatigues. They get into tactical gear, they get inside of armored personnel carriers, with 50-caliber sniper rifles, like  theyre in Iraq as far as theyre concerned. A lot of them are Iraq vets, and they might have PTSD or otherwise unresolved psychological problems, and also they have all these legal protections that we talked about so they can do no wrong. So they go to peoples houses, they do these things called no-knock warrants. So I mentioned the dangers of someone saying that theyre police, but they dont even have to say theyre police. So theyre just, like, busting peoples doors down and not announcing themselves, not serving a warrant, not getting on the loudspeaker and saying, Hey! Come out with your hands up! Weve got your house surrounded  we think youre a criminal! Thats like what a normal police would doYoure under arrest! Sorry we have to do this! But instead, they blow down peoples front doors, and then they got shot at  obviously, theyre gonna get shot at, because you have heavily armed civilians who are interested in protecting their families from violent criminals. And theres a violent criminal blowing down their door, so I dont understand why they dont expect to shot? [36:34] If youre busting down someones door, your primary expectation should be that theyre gonna shoot at you immediately, and they have every right to! Of course they do! You havent even announced yourselves. And then they start shooting back, and they kill your girlfriend, and thats what happened with Breonna Taylor. And then the prosecutor, he filed charges against the police officers for the bullets that missed Breonna Taylor, because the bullets went into other homes, and they said that was reckless. Anyway, maybe this is more about Libertarianism than about Bitcoin.", "image": null}

In mainstream economics, Hayek is kind of known for this, but it precedes Hayek and it transcends Hayek, which is Price as decentralized information. Its basically the output of the process between supply and demand, and theres two levels to it. And people who know about trading know this. Theres the order book, where its kind of the prices at which people are willing to buy and sell goods. And so everyones walking around with an order book in their headfor basically every single service and good under the sun, right? Where people are gonna say, Yeah, I would pay $5 for a ticket to the moon, if that was offered. I wouldnt pay $5 millionI mean I cant afford $5 million for anything, so thats out of reach. And so theres no clearing price. On the other hand, you go to the supermarket and toothpaste might be $3, and youre like, Okay, well Id be willing to pay $10 for toothpaste, but if theyre gonna sell it to me for $3, thats fine too, I wont argue with them. And then  you have a deal! Now the value of the toothpaste youre buying is greater than its price. And so thats why youre gonna go buy it. And thats a market buy. If you know about order books, you know the difference between limit orders  which is the price youre willing to pay  and the market order  where its just the price youre gonna pay right now, and youre gonna put down some cash for it. And then the producers of goods also have limit order books, where the toothpaste manufacturer knows that, Okay, in order to manufacture this toothpaste, were gonna have to put $2 of cost into it, and then we also want to have some profit margins, so lets put it at $3 or whatever. Although really, actually, thats not how they should set prices. How they should set prices is: What is the market willing to bear? How high of a price can we charge people before they start complaining and going to our competitors? [39:51] And so thats kind of how the market actually functions in some cases. In other cases, its more of like a cost-plus type situation, and it really depends on how defensible of a market position do they have? How strong is their brand? Because if theyve got a weak brand, then they cant charge a premium. Apple can charge 50% profit margins, because, at what price-point do you decide, Im not gonna buy an iPhone, Im gonna buy an Android instead? Apparently its like a thousand dollars! Because thats where the current price of a good iPhone is, you know? Now, obviously you can get a used iPhone for a lot less, and so maybe thats the way to look at the market: Apple is competing old Apple  so the secondary market. And thats the case in the stocks as well. So the stock market is like the secondary market for equity. [40:43] So its people buying and selling old, used stocks. And then theres the primary market of IPOs. Weve seen some IPOs recently of businesses raising capital because  now, okay, so what happens when the government intervenes in these markets? What happens when the government decides that the price of stocks is too low, so we as the government are gonna start buying stocks? Not only that, but theyre also just gonna start printing money to buy stocks. Theyre not gonna take the money from any other part of the system. They actually are taking money from a different part of the system: what theyre doing is theyre diluting out people who hold USD. People who hold money  cash, USD, in any form, and including people who hold government treasuries, because government treasuries are actually the same thing as cash at this point, because governments have already said that theyre gonna buy all their treasuries, by creating new dollars. So the Federal Reserve  and youll see Jerome Powell, whos the current chairman, or Neel Kashkari also has a video of him saying this, where they say, Well buy an infinite number of bonds in order to stabilize the economy. Well create an infinite amount of cash in order to provide liquidity to the system so that it continues to function. And thats why interest rates are going to zero, because a 0% interest bond is cash, right? Its just the same way of saying its cash, youre just giving it a different name, because the whole thing about cash is that its 0%. It just sits there. Whereas, a loan  you earn interest on a loan. If youre lending the money and taking on risk, theres no reason why you would ever lend out cash, if youre taking on risk. But if youre lending cash to the government, youre not actually taking on any risk, and theyre making this very clear to everyone, and so thus, its 0%. And its risk-free, right? They say, Hey, the risk-free interest rate is whatever treasury yields are. So, alright, lets take em at their word and thats 0%. [43:04] Anyway, when the government is spending money, usually its deficit spending, I think its like 30  any additional incremental spending is gonna be deficit spending, right? Nobodys raising taxes at this point, and theyre also cutting taxes, cutting payroll taxes, deferring taxes, and we can talk about the Coronavirus stuff. But in any case, every time the government is spending, or is buying bonds with the Federal Reserve, they are diluting out USD holders, and they are stealing wealth from people who hold USD. Now, you could say that its not really theft, because people who hold US dollars are being given ample forewarning that, like, Hey look, youre gonna have 2% inflation, youre gonna get diluted out  this is their explicit mandate. Which is fair, but when you think about who holds cash the most as a percentage of their balance sheet, its actually the people who are living from paycheck to paycheck, because they dont have the means to hold any other asset, which goes back to our earlier conversation about, well savings technology, thats all fine and well, but what about people who are living who are living from paycheck to paycheck? Their problem right now, is that they get their first paycheck, and so theyve got, lets say, $1000 in the bank. And theyre gonna spend it down over the course of a month, until their next paycheck, and so theyre gonna get another $1000. Living paycheck to paycheck is another way of saying living off of cash. Not having the ability to accumulate capital which would allow you to invest in stocks, which are not getting diluted out, right? In fact, they are where the dilution is going. They are where Money printer go BRRR  that shows itself in the stocks going up, and thats why ", "image": null}

Where, for the month that theyre holding that cash and drawing against it, its going up in value because its Apple shares, right? No, quite the opposite  their purchasing power is going down, and so theyre not even treading water. Theyre drowning! And the government is drowning them, because the government is making it such that the cash that theyre holding between paycheck periods is constantly losing value relative to both consumer goods that theyre spending money on, but also capital goods and real estate that theyre also spending money on indirectly through rents. So rents are going up, people cant even get ahead, theyve gotta get a second job, theyve gotta get a third job, and the government has turned the working class into an increasing inequality of, Okay, were gonna print money to enrich people who have the ability to accumulate assets, who own stocks and real estate  were gonna make them rich, and were gonna make everyone else poor. And thats the governments explicit policy right now. Same thing with the paycheck protection program. Instead of printing money and giving it to people, were gonna print money and give it to the biggest business owners, and then they can give it to the people or not  we dont care. So its kind of this kleptocracy thats built up, and its not Republican or Democrat, either. Every administration has this same policy, its all just about the marketing of Who do they pay lip-service to?

And so its like, by what metric are we trying to decide where the all-time high is gonna be, and why would I stop and take gains at any point? Because suddenly the expectation becomes, Hey look! The dollar is not long for this world  why would I want to hold dollar-denominated assets? Maybe I would want to rotate into some equities? Maybe I think stocks are cheap relative to Bitcoin, and I do a little bit of re-balancing at the margin, and maybe thats the angle? Or, there are companies generating Bitcoin cash flows, and who are using Bitcoin as their treasury reserve asset, and so now Im starting to think, Alright, well, its not really selling Bitcoin if I buy some equity that generates Bitcoin cash flow. I gotta calculate relative yield, and then Ive gotta do the Warren Buffett value-investing analysis of, Is this security fundamentally undervalued? Today, youd have to be a complete idiot to be a value investor. Why would you wanna think that fundamental value matters at all? The Federal Reserve is bidding up everything. Theres no such thing as fundamental value anymore. All youre doing is playing a game of greater fool, of, Hey look! Stocks only go up! You dont need to look at P/E ratios. Thats old school. But I think that with Bitcoin, its gonna make that popular again, because now its no longer like, Okay, I need to dump my inflationary cash thats getting diluted straight into the stock market, otherwise Im gonna lose purchasing power, right? And that the stock market has become a store of value, and people use the stock market for savings, and theyre like, Well, I gotta put my money somewhere  I gotta put my money to work. And with Bitcoin its like, No! I can actually just hold cash, and I can be like a poker player. I can wait for the next hand. Its not like the blinds are increasing, right? With Bitcoin, the blinds are negative. Your Bitcoin purchasing power is gonna be increasing long term, because it is a fixed amount, because it is scarce, and the supply of stocks and the supply of consumer goods is gonna increase, so your purchasing power is gonna increase, and so you can wait until you get investment opportunities that are really interesting to you. And so in the real estate world, they talk about location, location, location. Alright, well, that doesnt apply when youre under a fiat system. Under a fiat system youve gotta put your money to work as quickly as possible, so youve gotta buy whatever real estate properties are on the market whenever youre looking, right? You cant just sit on a bunch of cash and wait for a decade until somebody buys a piece of land that youve got your eye on. Youve gotta be working some angle in that 10 years.

So you start at zero with the Bitcoin ledger. And then youve got the genesis block, so thats 50 Bitcoin. Guess what? The Bitcoin code wont actually let anyone spend those 50 Bitcoin, so weve already eliminated 50 Bitcoin from the total spendable supply of Bitcoin. Why is that the case? Because the genesis block is actually hard-coded into Bitcoin. Why is that the case? Because you need a way to bootstrap the truth machine, right? What are you gonna has as the previous valid block if you dont have a first block? So its kind of this chick and egg problem. And Satoshi just solved it by hard-coding it and then saying, Hey look, to be fairno pre-mine, nobody can spend this, its just going to be hard-coded in there.

And if we contrast it with what has gone on since Satoshi, Satoshi was an incredibly ethical founder, as far as cryptocurrency systems go. And he made this 50 Bitcoin provably unspendable, and then everything after that he mined it, he used the Bitcoin algorithm, the SHA-256 squared like anyone else would. The next 50 Bitcoin that were actually mined by Satoshi  he mined at a loss, because they were worth nothing at the time. And he consumed electricity to produce them. So Bitcoin were created at a loss from the beginning. And so anyone who says, Oh, well Satoshi got this unfair amount, its like  Dude, he got nothing, he got zero dollars, or he got zero amount of value, however you want to put it. He didnt get any value for free, he actually lost value when he was mining Bitcoin. But you know what? He believed in the project. And so thats why he mined it, and he made is open source and he released it to the public and he immediately got as many people mining as he could. And ultimately, he couldnt force other people to adopt Bitcoin. What he could do was explain Bitcoins value proposition as he saw it, provide the source code, provide his thought process behind it, and then just hope that people join in and start mining. Anyway, back to the auditing: the way that that 50 Bitcoin is calculated of, Alright, every 10 minutes were gonna create new Bitcoin, and thats how were gonna distribute it, and its gonna go to the miner, who provides the proof-of-work. Ill skip over proof-of-work, because if we talk about Bitcoin mining, its gonna take the rest of the afternoon.", "image": null}

Because, more cost can be applied rationally  we can create more mining hardware, we can actually even use electricity thats more expensive per kilowatt-hour, and that actually causes blocks to get produced more quickly, and so then, you have a block coming out every 9 minutes, instead of every 10 minutes, which is what we were expecting. And then every 8 minutes. Okay, so whats the problem here? Well, if that had been the case for Satoshi, he could have instantly mined all 21 million Bitcoin on Day Zero. Because theres nothing fixing the clock. What Satoshi addedwhich was genius  was that every two weeks divided by 10 minutes, every X blocks ", "image": null}

And that this would presumably allow us to roll things back or fix them before an extensive amount of damage is done. Now there are other ways of doing this. So one other way of doing this is having different Bitcoin implementations. So the idea being that the inflation bug hopefully is not the same inflation bug in every implementation, and one of the implementations actually does things correctly. But it could conceivably be the case that the same inflation bug shows up in two different implementations. But, at this point I think thats very, very, very, very low risk.

I know that its value is gonna go up, and then theyre gonna want to buy more. And then theyre gonna buy more, and then theyre gonna want to understand it. At some point  or not! Thats fine too. They might get stuck somewhere, but, the idea being that, I did not understand Bitcoin until long after I had held some for a while. I didnt dig into, Okay, how does the UTXO set work, how do Bitcoin inputs and outputs work? I just knew addresses and wallets, for a very long time. And thats fine! Theres no reason to really dig into it, unless youre like, Okay, this system, not only is it valuable to me because I have Bitcoin, but its also valuable to me because I think that its the future. And that the sooner I learn this, the sooner I can start benefitting from it and living in the future. So its like, Okay, the Internet has just come out, and lets say youre a software developer. Do you want to learn web development now, or do you want to wait? Frankly, I would argue that, if I look back on when I first heard about software development, it was MySQL. MySQL was the database. And so, I couldve learned SQL back then, but I was reading WIRED magazine and I was like, Oh, software development is gonna be obsolete because its all gonna get outsourced to India. And so I was like, Okay, I dont need to learn SQL. Fast-forward 20 years, literally 20 years, everyones still using SQL. If I had learned SQL that wouldve been an excellent job skill to have from the Day Zero of having a job! Its a great skill to have! So I think that theres technologies that are Lindy, that are going to be around for a long time, that are going to be hugely valuable and powerful, and you might as well just learn them now, because youre gonna have to learn them at some point, and the longer you put it off, the less youre gonna benefit from it over your lifetime.", "image": null}

Mr. Saylor has very gracefully and thankfully accepted my invitation to come and join us in this seminar so we can discuss his companys move and how it relates to Bitcoin and The Bitcoin Standard, seeing that he publicly said this was an attempt to put his company on a Bitcoin standard.

I guess the best compliment I can give you is I read your book and I invested $425 million in Bitcoin. But actually, you know theres some people that read about Bitcoin and they decide theyre gonna buy some, and theres some people that read about it, you know, first its a speculationIm gonna buy some, and then some people read and think, Im gonna buy a lot, and some people read about Bitcoin and they think its cool technology, and they wanna get on the train. I think that The Bitcoin Standard is amazing, because it got me over those hurdles to realize that its not really about buying a lot, its actually about inverting the balance sheet of the company. What we were doing was that we were inverting the balance sheet such that were floating on a Bitcoin sail, on a crypto sail if you will, and as the liquidity and the monetary system gets pumped up, we want it to float, rather than sink, on that pool of liquidity. And I think that lots of other people in the Bitcoin industry have written a lot of stuff that is very interesting, but I thought that your book put it all together in a very compelling way. And so, it was probably the most impactful of all the stuff Id looked at on our way of thinking.", "image": null}

At the point in the book where you say that in the last decade, the monetary system has been expanding by 7% a year: I think weve been conditioned to think, well, 2% inflation  therefore 2% monetary expansion, and it never registered with me that even in normal times, you were getting 7% monetary expansion, or 8%, and then once I saw that, it all clicked for me, and I realized that a lot of the problem that we had was we were sitting on too much cash, and if you have $500 million in cash, and you make $500 million in operating income every year, then you have $35 million in after-tax cash-flow, which is equal to 7% of your cash balance, which meant that our asset purchasing power was deteriorating as fast as we were generating income, and we werent gonna get ahead, no matter how hard we worked, and it was a big epiphany.

I was really intrigued by your discussion with Stephan Livera in his podcast on inflation. Its a drum that Ive beaten for many, many years. But I thought your idea of saying that inflation, that there are three types of goods within an economy: (1) the goods that drop in price every year  technology, and goods that require heavy or high initial costs, initial fixed costs, and then low marginal costs  these tend to decline in price, and then you have (2) the goods that rise at a small ratelabor and land, basically undifferentiated labor and land if you want, not the most skilled labor and not the most desirable land and property  these things appreciate at around 1%, 2%, 3% every year, and then theres (3) the desirable, truly scarce things that people compete for, and these are the things where the inflation is 6%, 7%, 8% and maybe even up to 20% a year. And I think that was really an eye-opening way of thinking about it and I had not thought about it before. Im wondering if youve written something about this somewhere, or if youve come across it somewhere, because I think its a very useful framework that I intend to use in my next book, so where do I cite that?", "image": null}

If we keep repeating, Inflation is CPICPICPI, and then everythings CPI  we didnt get 2%  oh, theres no inflation  everybodys waiting for inflation. The big misconception is that a number is a scalar, and of course, anybody in engineering, if youre studying fluid dynamics, theres not a number. Its a vector. And a vector could be a stack of  if I stacked up a hundred different things I can give you a hundred different inflation rates. And I could give you a two-dimensional vector. And I could give you a three-dimensional vector. And vector calculus, and fluid dynamics  it gets pretty complicated. If I said to you, Look at this swirl of the water in a whirlpool, and you asked me, well whats the velocity of the water? I would say, Well it dependsits a vector. It depends upon which component you pick out. So the truth is, I bought into the lie of CPI until I read your book, Saifedean. And then at that point it was like, Oh its going up 7%. And then I thought, Wow, everything that I really want to buy is going up. You know, my MIT education went up more than 2%, healthcare goes up more than 2%, Ive got a house on Miami beach on two acres, cost $100,000 in 1930, it would cost you $20 million today. You know, it didnt go up 2%. And then I started thinking, Well, everythings scarce, and then I thought, Hamptons real estate doesnt go up 2%, Manhattan real estate doesnt go up 2%. And then it tripped to this horrific observation that a $1 million bond yields $50,000 in 2010, and then a $1 million bond today gives you $5,000. So a bond went up by 1,000% in ten years, and then you back solve that  thats 22% inflation per year in the last decade, and thats before we hit the financial crisis. And then I realized, the inflation rate is the thing that you choose to track, so we know that  when I wrote The Mobile Wave in 2012, my thesis was, mobile networks are dematerializing products and services. And that means, if you dematerialize a camera, or you dematerialize a photo, or you dematerialize a DVD or a CD or a tape recorder, and on your iPhone, youve got a tape recorder, and youve got a camera, and you dematerialize a credit card, I mean all these things theyve dematerialized, theyre deflationary and theyre going to zero. And the reason Apples the most valuable company on Earth is because they can ship a dematerialized product to a billion people for a nickel. Theres never gonna be any inflation if you wanna measure that  put that in your market basket  because theres no variable cost. And then you just have to come up with a vector of all these things, and of course, Whats got a variable cost? Well, if I give you a piece of paper that gives you the right to never work again the rest of your life and have as much money as you want? Would you like that? Thats scarce  thats going up. Because Apple cant dematerialize infinite power and money forever. And thats what Bitcoin is, right? Power and money forever. So what happens? I mean, you point out in your book, and I read all your papers after your book  you kept me up late, Saifedean, the last two nights. And Im reading, Anything that goes up in price, mankind can manufacture, given enough time and money, and chemistry. [09:56] So you think well fracking, right? The solution to the oil crisis was not to go to war in the Gulf. The solution to the oil crisis was: Let the price of oil go up. And when the price of oil got to $100 a barrel, then Wall Street raised $50 billion worth of capital, put it into fracking, invented fracking and doubled the oil production in the United States, and the problem that was a hundred-year-old problem that everybody kept talking aboutthe scarcity of oil  became a non-problem. So, the real question is, across all this array of products and services, you know, you want your nails done? You want your hair cut? You want caesar salad prepared table-side? Caesar salads table-side by a person with a tuxedo with a nice hair-cut, thats polite and speaks your language? Its gonna be more expensive. So the real issue is, can I manufacture with a robot  by the way, if I can, whats the variable cost? And as the variable cost falls, and as the capital intensity increases it becomes less deflationary and of course, the companies that are worth more money than God right now? Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, all have the same thing in common: theyre manufacturing products and services with a zero variable cost. [11:41] If everybody at Google went on vacation for the rest of the year, and didnt show up to work  every single one of em  you probably wouldnt notice. Like, YouTube would keep working, Google would keep working, theres not a single person involved in the delivery of the value proposition. The only thing theyre doing is creating the next version of the information factory. So you would notice in 2021 when they dont add a new feature to YouTube, but in fact the variable cost of Google is electricity and data  its the data center, its the electricity and the server spinning. So, you know really, once you come to that conclusion theres a vector  lets just make it a one-dimensional array. I described three buckets, but Saifedean the really interesting thing is, would anybody have guessed that the most inflationary, the best asset is a government bond yielding 3% interest. That seems the stupidest thing you could possibly buy, right? If youre a rational person. But the long bond index went up by 22% this year. So, youve got 25% inflation, S&P can show you 8% inflation, I can find you, you know, New York, Manhattan  you want a penthouse on Central Park thats 8,000 square feet with a perfect view? Seems kind of scarce. It is scarce but if you go to $100 million and Ken Griffin offers $100 million, they will build you a hundred-story skyscraper on a padand they built a bunch of em on Billionaires Row  and theyll sell you one apartment for $100 million. At a certain price, and theres floors 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70  theres a lot of scarcity if you build up. So, theres an entire theory of inflation, everybody says, Well youre only inflating 2% a year or 3%, well asset inflation is a vector too. S&P went up 8%, bonds went up 20%. Thats a vector. You know, gold didnt go up as much, right? So gold was an asset that inflated differently. So once youve done that, now theres a concept well call Cost of Capital. [14:35] Ive got $500 million in my treasury: whats my cost of capital? Well, youve gotta norm it against the asset inflation rate of something. I could peg it at 8%. Its a simplistic notion. Its definitely not 2%. But of course, now every product and service as defined has an intrinsic buoyancy. Everything has a buoyancy, so theres a multiple: the Fed prints a trillion dollars. Bonds inflate immediately. Stocks to a lesser extent. Gold to a certain extent. Farmland to a lesser extent. Luxury real estate in the Hamptons? A lot. But real estate in Ohio? Not so much, right? Hair-dressing and restaurants, not. So they talk about the Cantillion effect, being close to the money. But theres an entire array, a vector of coefficients you can calculate, and its a function of the construction of the product. Because the construction of a caesar salad next to my table is very labor intensive, capital intensive. The construction of a 30-year bond is something altogether different. So really, the K-shaped recovery we see is: half the world is sitting on top of financial assets that are floating on the pool of liquidity. Are you heavier than water? Or are you lighter than water? You want a simple thing? Its like, Yeah, I told you theres a flood coming and everybodys gonna drown, youre gonna be under a hundred feet of water  what would you do? Build an ark, right? So you build something that floats, you have to weigh less than the water. By the way, if I take block of granite or a block of concrete, its 30% buoyant, so if it weighs 1,000 pounds, it acts like 700 pounds under the water. If I want to really hold something down underwater I drop lead. Leads denser. Maybe thats the theory: Whats the economic density of any product or service, and how does it respond when you blow liquidity on it? And a chemist would say, well everybodys got a different coefficient. And the economists want to tell you that everybodys coefficient is the same. And then they just want to pick everything with a low inflationary coefficient, and they want to put that in their basket and they want to measure it. And the horrific observation I think youve made is, if I have the ability to re-balance the market basket, there will never ever be inflation, ever. You know, we had 22% inflation in the bond for a decade before COVID, and the world thought there was no inflation. Theres no inflation if you wanted a pizza, but if you wanted to retire at age 30 and work on your art or your writing or go to school or take care of your family, that inflated 22% a year. The American Dream, Im using a clich, you know, retirement, that was inflating at 22% a year running away from you while the pizza was flat. The bottom line is: No I didnt write anything. Youre the writer. You are the best writer in the entire industry, Saifedean. Let me say, like, I put the $400 million, the money, into Bitcoin because I kind of went down the rabbit hole and figured it out. But I actually, in a sneaky way, I maneuvered not just to say we were speculating Bitcoin or holding it as an asset or investing in it. I made it a treasury reserve asset, and then I had towe went through a tender offer where we had to let the investors decide whether they liked that idea or not like that idea. When we bought $250 million worth of Bitcoin we agreed to buy $250 million worth of our stock back. The stock was trading at $120, we tendered at $140. So Im inverting half the balance sheet, and the other half  I had $500 million that I didnt need for working capital. So we took half of it, put it in Bitcoin. The other half, we said, Look if you dont like this well buy you out at a premium. We waited 20 days. The stock traded above the tender price. We got $60 million tendered to us. I have $175 million extra, and some change. What am I gonna do with that?", "image": null}

Because the next thing Im gonna do is get the board to adopt the fact that, No, we didnt just agree to buy $250 million worth of Bitcoin, were gonna actually implement a treasury policy. The big idea, the Bitcoin Standard, for a corporationand I think we could be a model  is: we do business in 25 countries. In Yen in Japan, we have working capital in Japan in Yen, in Won in Korea, in Euros in Europe, in Pesos in Argentina, in Real in Brazil, in Dollars in the US. We were on a Dollar Standard, we had a bunch of USD sitting all around in USD accounts. Our working capital was $50 million a year  maybe I can convince my CFO well need less, well see, but we have about $50 million in working capital in our operating accounts, we had $700 million worth of other stuff, we started buying our stock back, and then we started thinking about the Bitcoin standard, and the conclusion is: You sell products and services in fiat, you hold operating accounts in the local fiat accounts  thats your working capital, you sweep your excess working capital into your treasury, you convert your treasury into Gold, if youre on the Gold Standard, or Bitcoin, if youre on the Bitcoin Standard. In the future, should you ever need to purchase property, purchase products or purchase services in excess of your operating accounts, you convert your treasury back into fiat, in the currency you need. If youre generating cash positive, if youre making $50 million a year, you just keep sweeping $50 million a year into your treasury. Then you have a choice: Do you buy your own stock, or do you buy Bitcoin? Well, our treasury policy is: We do one or the other subject to market conditions. The outside investors would say, Why dont you just give us the $500 million back? Well, if I give you the $500 million back I de-capitalize the company, its like you giving all your life savings to your favorite charity. Well youll feel good for a while, but if you lose your job, your children will starve. And if you care about your children, if you care about your customers, your employees, your counter-parties, your integrity  I signed a 10-year lease, Ive never missed a payment in my life. Ive been CEO for 31 years. I never missed a payroll, Ive never missed a payment. I look at a customer in the eye, I swear to them, I will maintain the software. Thats a matter of integrity. I do business with governments, banks. Everybody under the sun. They have to trust me. I have to be able to make good on my promises. I cant de-capitalize the company. So yeah, Ill buy the stock back from time to time, if its mispriced. If someone wants to short my stock, have at it. As long as you have a strong treasury, youre not afraid of a short seller. What do you do, drive my stock to $20 a share? I buy it all, go private, thank you. Do that.", "image": null}

{"title": "The Bitcoin Standard Podcast #5 Seminar - Michael Saylor & Microstrategy adopt The Bitcoin Standard", "url": "https://chowcollection.medium.com/the-bitcoin-standard-podcast-5-seminar-michael-saylor-microstrategy-adopt-the-bitcoin-standard-96cd1535ff81?source=user_profile---------42-------------------------------", "body": "Michael Saylor: You know, I went through thisI like Steve Jobs. Hes a great figure, and he had a near-death experience at Apple. Michael Dell said, Give the money back to the shareholdersthe company is dead. Apple almost went bankrupt back in the late 90s. And so, when Apple was successful he started accumulating cash. No dividends, no buybacks, just accumulate cash. And he did it because it was a formative experience, you know, you live through the Depression, you almost starve you accumulate cash, youre very conservative. I did things that I regret when I was a younger CEO, I borrowed money, my stock got shorted, we spent more than we generated in revenue. At one point we went to within 10 days of being de-listed. I got to within 5 days of bankruptcy and de-listing. My stock went from $333 a share to 42 cents, because I borrowed some money in a convertible preferred security, and the guys that issued the security were shorting my stock as they were hedging their security, and they shorted me, Saifedean, from $100 a share, to 42 cents. So you think you cant get beat to death? Thats a 99.8% top to bottom fall. And by the way, Im not blaming the world. I got the flesh flayed off my back. At the time, maybe I felt sorry for myself. Now I look back on it and I realize, You shouldnt spend more than you generate, and I shouldnt have borrowed money from someone in a convertible preferred, knowing that they were going to short it against me. And you should be responsible and save your pennies. So, that was 2003. I got conservative and we built up $700 million in cash, but everybody else thought, youre just crazy. And this is where I thought I was right but I was wrong, and they were right. Its a moral hazard, right, you point out. They were right because the cost of capital, according to Saifedean, in The Bitcoin Standard, is 7%. The inflation rate on assets is 7%. If I take $700 million and Im yielding 1% or 2%  and thats the best I could do on short-term treasuries  Im losing 5% every year on $700 million. So what I should have done, what you should do, is build a company so that youre sure that youre gonna generate cash-flow, I know easier said than done, right? Build a company so you know youre gonna generate cash-flow, and if youre not sure, you put a certain treasury balance, but you have to invest the treasury balance in something that yields better than cost of capital. Which means: no cash, no short-term government bonds. You might as well put it into the S&P 500. By the way, Saifedean, I wrote a book, The Mobile Wave in 2012, you can go read it. If you Google me youll find a 2-minute clip on YouTube no-one watched, 700 people watched, me sitting in my office in 2015 saying, You know Amazons gonna de-materialize and destroy 20,000 retail companies. Theres just no reason to buy anything else. Okay, no one cared. I wrote the book, and the theme of the book is: Apple is gonna de-materialize everybody. And Google, Facebook and Amazon are gonna crush everybody. If you bought the stock, you wouldve made 10x-20x your money. It was a very simple thesis: theyd already destroyed everybody. Theyre $100 billion networks that are de-materializing stuff, they can print products and services for zero variable cost, and theyre just gonna get stronger and stronger and stronger. The bottom line is, I made $50,000 on the bookyou know, you can make $500 million buying the stocks. And the lesson that was taught to me ", "image": null}

Roger Ver has been Tweeting at me, Its gotta be a medium of exchange. My view is, theres a $250 trillion ocean of assets: stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, derivatives  no ones buying a pizza with any of that stuff. No one ever took a share of Apple stock and walked into Starbucks and complained and bitched and moaned about not being able to use Apple stock in order to pay for their Starbucks. You have a house? Try using your house to pay for pizza! What do you think is the transaction velocity on a house? Put it on the market, wait 6 months, get a buyer. I wanna buy your house. Its 30 days. It takes 30 days and the transaction fee is 6%. You wanna sell a million dollar house? Its $60,000 in 30 days from the point that someone swears they wanna buy it. So somebodys running around in there saying, Well we gotta drive the transaction cost down. We gotta drive the transaction speed up. You need to be able to move the asset from point to point, peer to peer, as a settlement network. You need that. You need that for freedom. Its like I say to you: Saifedean, you can go anywhere in the world, youre free. That doesnt mean you should go to a different place every day. Now, having the freedom is not the same as using the freedom. Just because you can do a thing, doesnt mean you should do a thingStoic philosophy, Marcus Aurelius, 2,000 years ago, or whoever else did it. So, I look at this and I think, its nice, but you should sell your products and services in fiat, and you should sell your property in fiat. You should buy your property, your products and services in fiat, and the Yen, the Won, the Euro, the whatever, because thats the way that 99.99% of the people do it. You should sweep the excess monetary energy into your treasury, and you should convert it to Bitcoin. So, just one last point on this, and youll get it: the Parable of the Lions. A bunch of lions are chasing after a bunch of antelope. There are some lazy lions, they cant catch the antelope. They complain to the zookeeper on the game reserve, The antelope are running around too fast. Its too hard for us, we cant catch them. Slow them down. The zookeeper solves the problem by hobbling the antelope. The lazy lions catch the antelope. The lions eat the antelopes. The antelopes all die. Then the lions all die. The zookeeper blames it on the weather, and gets another job. Thats the story of transaction fees and transaction rates on a crypto network. Thats why the Ethereum, the Bitcoin Cash, all the other forks. You know this, youre the one who told me: its a billion times more expensive to do it on a proof of work network, or a trillion times? When it gets to be a billion times more expensive, thats enough, right? Its a billion times more expensive to do transactions on the network. The reason that you want crypto is you want sovereign immortality. I want to put $100 million on the network, and I want it to last for 100 years, and on the other end I want it to come out $100 million, even though half the governments failed, and everybody debased and destroyed everything. I want to put it in and I want it to transcend time and domain, time and space. By the way, thats a pretty good application for putting $250 trillion worth of stuff. But it doesnt have to move fast. I do think there are some interesting things that our business will look at in Bitcoin: were standing up a full node, and were looking at the data coming off of Bitcoin, and were looking to see if we cant thread the data sets and information from Bitcoin into our intelligence offerings, in order to provide that. But I dont feel the need to buy anything in Bitcoin or sell anything in Bitcoin, and its a billion times less efficient to do it that way. So, why do people get wrapped around the axle with the medium of exchange, theyre trying so hard. Only 1%, you know a typical rich person, a wealthy person, spends 2% of the wealth every year. 98% of their wealth just sits there. The richest man in the world, I guess its Jeff Bezos, is rich because of a bunch of assets including Amazon stock, thats hardly moving ever. And by the way, if you have any wealth, the thing that doesnt get said is, its so tax inefficient to sell it, and guys in New York realize this  there are families in New York City, they own a city block, theyve owned it for a hundred years, they have real estate on it. They never sell it. You just refinance it every year, theyve never made any money, Saifedean. I have $100 million worth of an asset: its going up 7% a year because the asset inflation rate on real estate in Manhattan is going up, probably more than 7% a year, right? Every 10 years I refinance it, I borrow some more money, its tax free, I live off of tax-free debt, a hundred years later, the familys got $1 billion worth of real estate, $700 million worth of debt, theyre paying 0% interest on the debt, theyve never made any income their entire life. Why would you ever generate operating income thats taxable? Everybodys just gonna borrow against their assets as their assets inflate. You know, I can borrow money from a bank, at LIBOR, I can borrow money for a yacht at LIBOR plus 200 basis points, Saifedean. And LIBOR is like, what? Whats LIBOR? I can borrow money against a liquid asset like a stock, at LIBOR plus 50 basis points. Why would you ever sell anything? And so this idea of moving around Bitcoin, its like taking the billion-times-harder way around the field. I gotta run around the field a billion times to score one run.", "image": null}

The way that I was thinking about it was, if you were going to be using it, you wont be using it on-chain. As I think you Tweeted about it a few days ago, what was it, 99.8% of Bitcoin transactions would happen off-chain. This is something that people miss when they talk about scaling, because whatever asset youre talking about whether its another digital currency or a physical gold or a government money, youre not gonna perform final settlement with every cup of coffee. Its just not gonna happen. The final settlement is gonna come at a much slower rate than the transactions, and the day-to-day transactions are going to happen between people who are within networks that you have repeated business with one another so that if your credit card bounces at the coffee shop theyll know you the next day and theyll tell you Hey get a new credit card or stop doing this. Their bank will contact your bank or their credit card company will take away your credit card. There are these mechanisms for the smaller payments, and thats how Bitcoin scales. People misconstrue the Bitcoin network as a payments network and they compare it against VISA or Mastercard on top of Bitcoin and Bitcoin will be the final settlement asset, but it will be much better and faster final settlement than you would get with national currencies.", "image": null}

How many transactions do you think Jeff Bezos has done to sell his Amazon stock in his life? Id be willing to bet you, he picks up the phone once a quarterabout ten times. Hes probably picked up the phone about ten times, and he said to one guy, Uh, well why dont you sell a million shares of Amazon for me? Click. And he put the phone down. Maybe he did a hundred transactions, okay? Hes just fine. Thats the way it works. Youre gonna sweep your excess capital into a working capital account, and its gonna be on Square or PayPal or ApplePay, or in some random bank. By the way, I dont trust my bank in Argentina for a hundred years. I mean, I had it fail ten years ago. I lost $1 million in Argentina. One day it was in dollars in Bank of America. The next day by edict it was in Pesos at 1:1 in Bank of America. The next day it was devalued to 10:1 in the same bank, and I got back $100,000 and I started with $1 million, and it was gone. The only two places in the world I ever lost money in a bank was Brazil and Argentina. You dont forget those things. Having said that, I do business with banks in Brazil and Argentina today.

And life is too short, Saifedean, to try to convince a fanatic to change their mind. The worlds got 7 billion people in it, and if you go on my Twitter and youre rude, or uncivil, or a jerk, block, block, block. Im not gonna  Ill take one second, but you dont get to hang out. But to your point, you said, electronic cash in a classical format, so that Im making cash delivery in settlement, this is back to the Stoic issue: you need the ability to have peer to peer payments in order to have freedom and sovereignty. You need the ability. Just because I have the ability to move $1 or $1 million or $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, I have the ability to send it to anybody anytime, and its gonna cost me a few bucks, and 30 minutes. Just because you can do a thing, doesnt mean you should do a thing. The fact that you have the ability to do it 1 out of 100,000 times, means that its a harder form of currency, and a better money than anything else. Theres a phrase: a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. People get wrapped around the axle of doing a literal interpretation. Theyre like, Well thats not what Satoshi said. Heres where Nicholas Taleb has a good insight here: A semantic representation of a sophisticated idea may not be adequate. If you come into my restaurant and you ask me whats on the menu and I say Cold, dead fish, you might be horrified by that. If I said it to you in Japanese you wouldnt even know without translating it. If I wrote a book on it, you might understand it better. If I just put it in front of your face, you might think its pretty good sushi. Just because the words dont resonate doesnt mean the thing isnt a good thing. So, its a 9-page whitepaper, and if you interpret it through a certain lens, you understand  by the way, it doesnt even matter if he understood what he was saying or not. Its putting a lot of weight on one dude or a group of guys 10 years ago to extrapolate how the world was going to evolve later. So I think they had a vision, and the vision works well as a settlement network, and for people who are clinging to an orthodox interpretation of that vision 10 years later, they choose to imbue those semantic representation with their ideology, and its crippling to the future of Bitcoin because they wanna do something  I want to make one more point: if I move $1 from point A to point B, versus $1 billion from point A to point B, isnt it obvious on its surface that the value in use of moving $1 is a billion times less than the value of moving $1 billion? So theyre chasing the long tail down to something which is exponentially less valuable, and theyre making it a priority on a network, and thats long-tail foolishness.", "image": null}

The Wright brothers, after inventing the airplane, they said, one of them, I cant remember which, he said, Its impossible that an airplane will ever cross the Atlantic. And so, what, do we ban flights across the Atlantic because the Wright brothers said it cant happen? Viagra was meant to be a heart drug. Do we ban it now for other uses because the original vision of the founder was this? You know, technology finds its way based on what people want and not on what inventors say and think, and I think thats completely midguided. One question I wanted to ask you is a topic that I will focus on in my next book The Fiat Standard. In that book Im trying to do to fiat money what I did to Bitcoin. When I wrote the Bitcoin Standard the idea was, How do I get this to an intelligent reader with no background? How do I explain to them how this Bitcoin thing works and why it matters? And do it for someone who has zero background as to how this monster works? And I think that kind of framework would be more useful to apply to fiat money because fiat money is a hundred times more complicated than Bitcoin, and I think a lot of people could benefit from trying to understand that. And so, as I started to think about fiat money as an engineer, trying to explain how it functions in the same way that I did with Bitcoin, one mechanism of understanding how it works is that, under a gold standard, if you find a way of making more gold in the world, youre going to take advantage of it, youre going to start digging up the gold and selling it because that costs you less than what the price of gold is on the market. Similarly on a Bitcoin standard people are trying to mine more Bitcoin. But on a fiat standard, everybody is trying to mine fiat, and the way that it works on a fiat standard is, you mine fiat by issuing debt, so you can mine it by printing pieces of paper, but thats really the old fiat standard. Today, the vast majority of money is not pieces of paper, its debt thats issued by banks. Everytime a new financial institution makes a new loan, new fiat money is created.", "image": null}

I think the metaphor of a bank as a fiat miner is the most brilliant, breakthrough metaphor. I read that in your paper last night, I was up late reading it, and I got to whatever, page 30 and you got to some point where you said banks are in essence mining fiat and I thought, Oh my god, that is just the most  like, no one has ever said that before! But, once you get that idea youre like, Now I know why I wanna run a bank, and now I realize why the world is so screwed up because theyre out of control. So keep going, but I just wanted to say, I think its unique, seminal, brilliant, Ive never heard anybody ever express it that, but it explains so much once you have that metaphor in your head.", "image": null}

So if you want to buy a house for $1 million with cashthats one thing, but then if you take the cash from a bank, well the bank gets to create $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000 of new fiat out of this process. So, theyre gonna give you a better deal on it than if you buy it with cash, and thats why you get into debt for your house and for your business, and for everything. You know, individuals and corporations and governmentseverybody is up to their eyeballs in debt because getting into debt is mining fiat. So I think this might be the most vivid way in which Bitcoin fixes the world, this might be the most powerful way, because this allows us to monetize something other than debt. We dont need to keep mining debt in order to have money, we can start mining a hard asset that has no counter-party liability, and that is much more solid, whereas, you can build a financial system on it because you know that the value of this Bitcoin is not dependent on counter-parties making this financial obligation. But currently, the choice that you wouldve faced with your reserves before Bitcoin was, you had to put them either in cash and watch them get robbed of purchasing power every year, or you had to put them in debt and then take on the counter-party risk of the governments or the agencies or all the bonds that youre using, and primarily its government treasuries that people use the most. The interesting thing to think about is that if Bitcoin leads to a reduction in the demand for debt, a reduction in the demand for treasuriesbecause people like you are using Bitcoin as a reserve asset rather than holding bonds, then I think theres another factor that goes in, because Bitcoin is, (a) its leading to a reduction in the demand for dollars, but (b) its also leading to a reduction in the supply of newly mined fiat dollars because its reducing the demand for debt. Or at least if it increases significantly, you know  were gonna see a hundred Microstrategy(s), that means less demand for government bonds. So in a sense it kind of cancels each-other out: Bitcoin is not just taking the demand away from the dollarits taking the demand away from the dollar and reducing the supply of the dollar, which I think is an optimistic way of saying we dont have to have hyperinflation. We can witness this thing continue, whereby, the supply of the dollar declines and the demand for the dollar declines while the value of Bitcoin rises and the demand for Bitcoin rises.", "image": null}

And then youve got a gold monetary system: you put $100 million in gold, youre gonna lose 80% or 85% or 90% of your position over a hundred years, because its inflating, and its got counter-party risk. And then youve got a stock monetary system: youve got like an equity monetary system  that people are worshiping at the altar of NASDAQ right now. And theyre basically floating into Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, because they think that these are indestructible utilities thatll go on forever. So you put it into those, and I think youre gonna lose value because at some point theyre gonna get regulated and theyre gonna actually get chopped into pieces by well-meaning politicians. One way or the other. But that system has captured all the value, right? All of the wealth on Wall Street has surged: first it moved into bonds and then it moved out of bonds into the equity markets over the past 34 months. The only way you stay in bonds  by the way, theres a bond monetary system. If the interest rates are gonna keep going down, the bonds will keep going up, so you put your store of value into bonds. And the only way that keeps working now is interest rates have to go negative. If interest rates dont go negative, the bond monetary system stops working for the wealth of the world, so they go to equity. And thats why the Big Tech is a crowded trade, and why the NASDAQ has gone to all-time highsand the S&P. Now, at some point that stops working, because the P/Es blow out and youre valuing Apple at 3x  youve got companies that are a hundred times revenue that are trading on NASDAQ now. So at some point that de-laminates, and now, what you really wanna do is position Bitcoin as another digital asset, and then you have all the people with their money in Apple, in Amazon, in Facebook, in Google, surging into Bitcoin as the store of value, right? Theres a good storythis is why you dont want to curry the narrative of: well this is for privacy and fighting the government and escaping regulations and censorship and off-chain and We hate Wall Street, We hate institutions, We hate institutional custodians  if youre basically going down that narrative, youre inviting every government to outlaw you. And the number one issue, Saifedean, ofcan we have a peaceful transition from a debt economy to a Bitcoin economy  is: are they gonna outlaw Bitcoin? Okay? If they think that Bitcoin is Apple stock, the answer is no. If Bitcoin is Apple or Bitcoin is Google or Bitcoin is Amazon, theyll bounce it around a bit but no one is walking around saying We need to pass a law to stop you from owning Apple stock. On the other hand, when you start talking about, I wanna do things to evade regulators and the like, its like in Russia they said you cant use it as a currency, you can use it as an asset, that was the law. What you wanna do is you wanna position Bitcoin as an asset, and then people will just sit around and say, Am I gonna put my money in real estate or gold or silver or Bitcoin or Apple stock? And then its kind of an easy decision, isnt it? I mean, as soon as you know its not gonna blow up and failif Bitcoin was a company, or whatever, I think youd see a surge. And for us to see a peaceful transition, we need to not have a situation like in Venezuela or a Zimbabwe where they pass a law and they say, You cant have it. You dont wanna go back toyou saw with the 1934 Gold Act, right? You dont want the government to seize your gold, and you dont want them to seize your Bitcoin. [54:54] And so, to the extent that they just view it as another asset that people choose to hold and is non-threatening, I think that youll see a migration to it. To the extent that they see it as trying to replace the US Dollar, then it becomes a different thing. So, thats what I think on that.", "image": null}

What do you think of the idea that Bitcoin can potentially be the final  be the way that we get rid of QE? Right now all Wall Street companies, they constantly face liquidity problems whenever theres any kind of problem in the market and then that requires an endless amount of liquidity intervention. But if they had a proper cash reserve on their balance sheet, they wouldnt care about these liquidity problems, you know?

I agree with that. I think that, as it gets stronger, the number one benefit of it is it keeps everybody else honest. Right? It spreads, it keeps people honest. If the government  lets take Argentina  if the government of Argentina knew that every wealthy Argentinian, everybody in Argentina had their treasury in Bitcoin, they would think twice before they print kazillion amounts of additional currency, right? It will create a discipline, because the citizenry has some power, the citizenry can choose not to participate. So as it spreads I think it will create rationale.

Yeah, I used to live in Lebanon up until very recently, and if youve heard the news, Lebanons banking system is in tatters now and the currencys been destroyed, and after I left, I realized that banks were giving insanely high interest rates to people on their savings accounts, and for me the amazing thing about Bitcoin is that all of those years Id lived in Lebanon and I never borrowed a cent or lent a cent to my bank, basically. My paycheck comes into my bank, and I use it just for day to day transactions and then never had to worry about whats going to happen with the Lebanese government and their solvency and all of the bonds and all of that stuff. And its amazing to think that if in 20 years time, everybody else in countries like Lebanon and Argentina had that option, then theres very very little scope or room for the government to rob people. The peace of mind that comes to me from the fact that, no matter what happens in all of the worlds banks, and all of the worlds central banks, and all of the worlds governments, theyll never be able to destroy more than a small part of my wealth which I happen to keep in any particular bank at any particularly point in time. And this is just amazing, you know? Its a one-time solution to make sure that you will never be Lebanoned, you will never get the Argentina Special, you will never get that inflation. Its amazing. And I think its only a matter of time before more and more people figure out this solution.", "image": null}

While Im sitting, for days at a time, and Im trading and Im buying this Bitcoin, and I watch money$500,000 of cash  become, whatever, 50 Bitcoin, and Im watching these kind of things happen, I had this epiphany that the destiny of money is to be encrypted. Every time I did the trade I thought, I just took $500,000 of cash  that someone can burn and steal  and I put it into a vault of encrypted energy, and now they cant get at it, and I just had this massive dopamine hit, that this felt so good to encrypt my money. The destiny of money is to be encrypted  in Bitcoinnot any encryption. The second observation is, I just think your book is brilliant, and your work is brilliant, and you should publish again.
