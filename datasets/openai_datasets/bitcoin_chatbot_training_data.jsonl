{"prompt": "Why is Bitcoin important? It enables cryptographically secure, censorship resistant payments across borders. It is the first and only form of absolute digital scarcity and is not controlled by any one person or group. As a result it cannot be interfered with by any world government.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How does it work? Alice sends a transaction from her wallet which is received by 1000\u2019s of network participants who tell each other that Alice wants to send to Bob. The transaction is seen by a miner who dedicates computing power to group Alice\u2019s transaction into a block along with lots of other transactions. Once Alice\u2019s transaction is mined into a block, Bob will have the corresponding amount of bitcoin in his wallet."}
{"prompt": "Who invented Bitcoin? The world learned of Bitcoin in 2008 when an anonymous online entity called \u2018Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019 shared the Bitcoin White Paper to an online mailing list. Satoshi disappeared in 2011 and has never been seen online since. In the years since, hundreds of developers worldwide have continued to contribute to and improve the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What gives Bitcoin value? It is scarce (there will only ever be 21 million) and this can be verified by anyone with a $30 single board computer. It has an immense amount of computational power dedicated to securing its distributed ledger. The network literally pays people to protect its integrity and act in good faith. Bitcoins \u2018price\u2019 in $ or \u00a3 terms is determined by simple market supply and demand."}
{"prompt": "Who controls the network? Put simply, everyone and no-one. Everyone is in control of their own participation in the network and the network is structured so that bad actors cannot succeed. No single developer can incite any changes to the code. No one miner can censor specific transactions. No single user can cheat the system and spend Bitcoin they don\u2019t have or that does not belong to them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Is Bitcoin anonymous? At a network level, bitcoins are not \u2018tagged\u2019 to any public identity. The protocol only knows of strings of letters and numbers known as an address. However, businesses built on top of Bitcoin such as KYC exchanges where it\u2019s possible to buy bitcoin can link your real world identity to bitcoin purchased through them. The bitcoin ledger is completely public so it can be possible to track known public entities across a network."}
{"prompt": "What is the blockchain? The blockchain is a public ledger that contains a copy of every single bitcoin transaction ever completed. Miners compete to produce blocks for transaction fees and a block subsidy. Each successful block is cryptographically linked or \u2018chained\u2019 to its predecessor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cant the government stop it? Governments could absolutely make Bitcoin illegal in their jurisdiction. In fact China has already done so, multiple times yet the ecosystem continues to flourish. Bitcoin\u2019s distributed nature means that in reality it would require a monumental co-ordinated attack from many world powers to stem its growth."}
{"prompt": "Isn\u2019t it used by criminals? Bitcoin is money and any money can be used by criminals. In 2017 the entire drug trafficking market alone was estimated to be worth $500,000,000,000 (500 billion). At current prices that could buy the entire Bitcoin network 11 times over! It\u2019s probably fair to say that the overwhelming majority of illicit activities are funded by fiat currencies.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cant someone just copy it? At a network level yes, and lots of people have. There are literally hundreds of copies of Bitcoin, each usually with a minor tweak to its code to \u2018improve\u2019 it. Almost always these \u2018improvements\u2019 come with huge tradeoffs that prevent them from gaining any traction on Bitcoin\u2019s massive network effects."}
{"prompt": "Doesn\u2019t it waste energy? It\u2019s true that the Bitcoin network consumes a lot of power, but spending energy to secure and operate a global payments network that provides huge amounts of value to millions of people should not be seen as \u2018wasteful\u2019. Bitcoin mining has already started to push innovation in the use of alternative (often wasted) energy sources such as flared gas or renewables.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How many bitcoins are there? At the time of writing there are a little over 18 million bitcoins that have been mined. There will only ever be 21 million and the final one will be mined around the year 2140. Each bitcoin can be subdivided into 100 million Satoshis or \u2018sats\u2019 so there are plenty to go around."}
{"prompt": "How are bitcoins created? New bitcoins are created as a result of the globally distributed and highly competitive mining process. Each newly mined block rewards the successful miner with a subsidy. At the time of writing, this subsidy has just been halved to 6.25 bitcoins. It will halve again to 3.125 bitcoins after another 210,000 blocks or roughly 4 years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is mining? The process of participants contributing large amounts of computing power to process transactions into blocks. Once they have grouped these transactions a miner performs a repetitive computational task on them to try and find an answer that is below a certain target. If they are successful, the block is mined and the miner receives the transaction fees and block subsidy. The process then starts again and the next batch of transactions."}
{"prompt": "Where can I buy some? There are lots of online exchanges that you can buy bitcoin from although you should do your own due diligence when finding somewhere to buy from. The best way to get your first piece of bitcoin is to buy some from a trusted friend or family member. Remember - You can buy a fraction of a bitcoin (there are 100 million sats in each one)! See here for some recommendations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By Bitcoin Q+A | Support | More resources"}
{"prompt": "Buying KYC bitcoin Buying KYC bitcoin from the likes of Cash App is a very fast and easy way to purchase bitcoin. We aren\u2019t saying that you absolutely shouldn\u2019t do this but we want you to know the trade offs. When you sign up with these companies you will need to supply some form of photo I.D which tags the bitcoin you buy to your public identity. Due to the public nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, surveillance firms can \u2018follow\u2019 you and watch your future transactions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Not exploring other purchase options So you don\u2019t like the sound of KYC\u2019d bitcoin, what are the other options? The are Peer to Peer exchanges such as Bisq and HodlHodl which use an escrow service to allow you to buy bitcoin from someone anywhere in the world, however these generally aren\u2019t as easy to use as the KYC alternatives By far the easiest option to get yourself started it to buy some off a friend or family member. Ask around, there\u2019s more Bitcoiners out there than you think!"}
{"prompt": "Not running a node Simply, if you aren\u2019t using your own node then you are using someone else\u2019s, wether you know them or not. That\u2019s how Bitcoin works. Having a wallet connected to your own node means you don\u2019t rely on anyone else to transact which gives huge privacy benefits. By using your own node you can also be confident that the data displayed in your wallet is accurate and abiding by your nodes \u2018Bitcoin rules\u2019.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Leaving bitcoin on exchanges Yep, we bought KYC bitcoin and because we didn\u2019t know how to operate a wallet we left it on the exchange. If you have bitcoin on an exchange, you don\u2019t have bitcoin. You have an IOU and you should learn enough (with our help hopefully) to get that bitcoin off the exchange and into a wallet that you control the private keys of. There have been multiple exchange hacks in the past and people have lost large amounts of bitcoin, don\u2019t let that be you."}
{"prompt": "Sending someone your private keys Thankfully we have never fallen for this one but many people have. It is quite common in public chat groups such a telegram for scammers to impersonate someone from the Bitcoin community offering support to someone that may be asking for help. NEVER\u2026..EVER give your private keys or seed words to anyone, especially on the internet.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Storing seed words insecurely Your seed words are the keys to your bitcoin, anyone with control of these can access your funds. You should store these in a secure manner, but be mindful that you don\u2019t store them so securely that you forget where they are. Believe it or not, it happens. It\u2019s not a good idea to store them on your computer."}
{"prompt": "Sending to the wrong address Thanks to scannable QR codes and error detection features being implemented into wallets, these days this is becoming quite difficult to do. Bitcoin addresses are long strings of numbers and letters so its always good practice to use QR codes or at the very least copy/paste when sending to someone. It\u2019s also good advice to visually check the address at least once before sending.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Getting hyped The more you learn, the more excited you get about Bitcoin. Still happens to us now! This can be compounded if you spend time on the likes of Bitcoin Twitter and it\u2019s very easy to get over excited and buy more than you can afford. Bitcoin is a young and extremely volatile asset, you should do your own research and never buy more than you can afford to lose. There is a saying in the community which is a very good rule to live by\u2026 \u2018Stay humble, stack sats\u2019."}
{"prompt": "Trying to trade Bitcoin is extremely volatile, its not unusual to see a 20% price swing in either direction in a single day. If you aren\u2019t experienced and you try to play these markets, you WILL lose money. Tread carefully.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Doxxing yourself Bitcoin lives on the internet which, much like the real world is full of people willing to take your stuff. Talking about owning bitcoin online or in the real world can quite literally post a target on your back for thieves or scammers. A common approach for people who interact with the online Bitcoin community is to create an online persona completely separate from their real world identity."}
{"prompt": "Not asking for help The Bitcoin community is a vibrant and helpful one. There are hundreds of different telegram groups, GitHub or reddit pages and people on Twitter that are willing to help. Feel free to ask us a question too. Remember, if you aren\u2019t sure, ask.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Not using 2FA Everything we do online these days comes with an account linked to our email. If your email account becomes compromised it can be an open door into your life for a scammer.Two factor authentication provides and extra security layer to protect you from being hacked. Avoid using the SMS version and opt for an app or key based one. Common examples include Authy or Google Authenticator."}
{"prompt": "What are seed words? Seed words (or mnemonic) are a sequence of 12 or 24 randomly generated words created when you make a new wallet. These words are your master backup for the entire wallet and should not be shared with anyone or stored anywhere they could be compromised. Anyone with access these words can steal your bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is a passphrase? A passphrase (often called the 13th/25th word) is a user defined additional word or phrase designed to add an extra layer of security to your backup. If your seed words become compromised but you have passphrase defined then an attacker would still need your passphrase to gain access to your bitcoin. Never store your seed words and passphrase together."}
{"prompt": "What is a private key? Generated from your seed words, a private key is proof that the entity in control of it has access to spend from the corresponding address. Your wallet will generate a private key for every address it creates. Most users of bitcoin today will never interact directly with a private key, it is generally managed automatically by wallet software.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is a public key? Public keys are used in a transaction to verify that the owner of the corresponding private key has created a valid signature as proof of ownership of funds. Again, from a general user perspective public keys will never be directly used or seen."}
{"prompt": "What is an extended public key? An extended public key (or Xpub) can be seen as the master view into your bitcoin wallet. An Xpub is capable of generating and viewing every address contained within a wallet so you should be mindful who and you share your extended public keys with. If you aren\u2019t connected to your own node then it\u2019s highly likely than someone else knows your Xpub. Variations of an Xpub include Ypub and Zpub, all do the same job.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is an address? An address is a string of numbers and letters that is unique to your wallet. It is what you share with others to receive bitcoin. Wallets can produce an infinite number of addresses so it\u2019s a good idea to never use the same one twice for privacy. Most wallets manage this for you and produce a new address every time you receive whilst keeping a track of your total balance."}
{"prompt": "What is a mobile wallet? A mobile wallet is one that runs on your mobile phone. They enable quick access to your bitcoin but carry the risk that if you lose or break your phone you may lose your bitcoin. This should not be a problem provided you have your seed words recorded safely so that you can restore you wallet on another device.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is a desktop wallet? A desktop wallet is one that runs on your computer. Desktop wallets generally come with more functionality than mobile wallets but can also be more complicated. With computers being internet connected devices that are susceptible to malware you should exercise caution with the software you install."}
{"prompt": "What is a hardware wallet? A Hardware Wallet (HWW) is a device dedicated to the creation and storage of your private keys. Most HWWs are seen as more secure than general purpose hardware like computers or cell phones. This is because the attack surface is much smaller for a device built for a single, specific task. A HWW is even more secure when air-gapped, meaning that the device is never plugged into a computer. When air-gapped, QR codes or SD card file transfers are used when sending transactions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is a multi-sig wallet? A multi-signature wallet is a wallet the requires more than one private key to sign a transaction. This could be anything from 2 of a possible 3 keys to sign or 15 of 20, It\u2019s up to the user when creating the wallet. Multi-sig is more secure than single-sig but is a lot more complicated when it comes to creation, backup and transacting. New users should tread carefully."}
{"prompt": "What is a watch only wallet? A watch only wallet is created using your extended public key (Xpub) which allows you to track the balance of a wallet. Watch only wallets do not contain private keys and cannot be spent from. Be careful who you share your Xpubs with, anyone with access to this can track your bitcoin balances.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is a custodial wallet? A custodial wallet is a wallet where the you do not control the private keys. Custodial wallets are often able to obfuscate away some of the complexity of bitcoin wallets but this comes with the risk of not being in control of your bitcoin. Custodial wallets are generally operated by exchanges and users should not keep large amounts of bitcoin in them."}
{"prompt": "What is a non custodial wallet? A non custodial wallet is a wallet where you are in control of your private keys. This is the way bitcoin was designed to be used and you should always ensure the wallet you are using is non custodial. A quick way to find out, did you have to write down your seed words when you opened your wallet? If yes, then you have a non custodial wallet.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How do I know what fee to use? This depends completely on how quickly you need your transaction to be processed and how busy the network is at the time you want to send bitcoin. Most wallets will provide you with an estimate based on these parameters and allow you to adjust as necessary."}
{"prompt": "What is a QR code? A QR code is a visual representation of data. They are most commonly used in Bitcoin to convert long and difficult to read addresses into a form of barcode that can be scanned by the senders wallet. This removes the need to type in the address which could lead to mistakes being made and bitcoin sent to the wrong address.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is a block explorer? A block explorer is a website or application that allows you to find the details of any block on the blockchain. You can find data such as number of transactions in a block, sender address, recipient address, fees paid, amount sent, block height and block time."}
{"prompt": "Simple answers to your common Bitcoin node questions\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Learn more about the different types of nodes here"}
{"prompt": "What is a node? A node is a computer that runs the Bitcoin software. Your node is your own version of the Bitcoin blockchain and ruleset. Think of it as your own gateway to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It broadcasts transactions, verifies the bitcoin you receive are legitimate and maintains your privacy by allowing you to participate without reliance on anyone.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Why run a node? Your node = your rules. When you connect your wallet to your node, you are not trusting in anyone else to verify your transactions. A node protects you from bad actors and it also keeps the network decentralised. If you do not have your own, you are trusting in someone else\u2019s node to tell you how much bitcoin you have and to broadcast/receive your transactions."}
{"prompt": "What to consider before running a node? Nodes are designed to be ran 24/7 so depending on hardware used there will be some power costs associated. Most nodes run on low power single board computers such like the Raspberry Pi so running costs are negligible. You should also have an unmetered internet connection as a node will use around 20gb a month. Ensure you buy or build a node that completes the initial block down from scratch otherwise you are trusting someone else\u2019s blockchain data.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What types of node are there? It\u2019s possible to run a node on your existing computer by simply downloading Bitcoin core. The most common \u2018plug + play\u2019 nodes are MyNode or Nodl. These come with everything required to get started. A lot of users choose to buy their own hardware and install Bitcoin software themselves. Common software choices include MyNode, Ronin Dojo or Raspiblitz (all of which are free and open source). Click here to see our recomended nodes."}
{"prompt": "What else can a node do? This is very much dependant on the configuration you run. Some common \u2018extra features\u2019 include a lightning node, electrum server, block explorer, mempool viewer, whirlpool implementation and payments infrastructure such as BTC Pay Server.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is the initial block download? The initial block download (IBD) takes place when you first start your node. Your software is downloading the entire Bitcoin blockchain and verifying the entire transaction history. When synced this allows your node to verify the bitcoin you are receiving are legitimate and reject anyone trying to cheat the system. Sync times will vary with hardware and internet speeds but on average the process takes around 4-7 days."}
{"prompt": "What is a pruned node? Node pruning is an option for your node to discard any old data it doesn\u2019t require after it has fully validated the entire blockchain. The can be useful if you have storage constraints but it does mean that when enabled your node is not supporting the network by allowing new nodes coming online to download information from your blockchain data.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is a lightning node? A lightning node is your gateway to the lightning network which is an experimental scaling solution built on top of Bitcoin. It is generally run on the same device as your Bitcoin node and much like your Bitcoin node it is used to interact with other people on that network via sending and receiving payments."}
{"prompt": "Can I use someone else\u2019s node? Yes you can connect to someone else\u2019s node. This is the default for a lot of wallets but you should use with caution for the reasons listed in above. If you have a trusted friend that runs a node this would be a better alternative than trusting a third party company. The ultimate way to participate in the Bitcoin network is to run your own node.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By Bitcoin Q+A | Support | More resources"}
{"prompt": "Simple answers to the common Lightning Network questions\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " For a more in depth look at the Lightning Network, see here"}
{"prompt": "What is a node? A node is a computer that runs the Bitcoin software. Your node is your own version of the Bitcoin blockchain and ruleset. Think of it as your own gateway to the Bitcoin ecosystem. It broadcasts transactions, verifies the bitcoin you receive are legitimate and maintains your privacy by allowing you to participate without reliance on anyone.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is the Lightning Network? The Lightning Network is scaling solution built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. It facilitates smaller, near instant payments between users at very low cost. It prevents the need for every transaction made to take place on the Bitcoin \u2018base layer\u2019 whilst still ensuring that the value being transacted abides by the core rules and values of the Bitcoin network. You cannot transact on Lightning without owning bitcoin."}
{"prompt": "Why do we need Lightning? Right now we don\u2019t really NEED the Lightning network because normal bitcoin transactions (commonly referred to as \u2018on chain transactions\u2019) are relatively cheap, even if you want a fast confirmation time. Lightning really starts to shine when \u2018on chain\u2019 fees increase as the Bitcoin user base increases and the block subsidy decreases. Lightning also shows great promise in smaller, more frequent payment uses cases for things like unlocking online content.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How does the Lightning Network work? Alice opens a payment channel with Bob by making an on chain \u2018funding transaction\u2019. The size of this funding transaction dictates how much value Alice can transfer using Lightning. Once the funding transaction is confirmed on the base layer, Alice is free to transact with Bob over lightning as many times as she likes until one or both of them decide they want to close the channel. Each lightning transaction updates the current state of the channel so that neither party can cheat each other out of any funds. When the channel is closed, the most recent \u2018channel state\u2019 is broadcast to the Bitcoin network and both parties will receive the relevant balance back to their wallet."}
{"prompt": "But what if Alice wants to pay someone else? This is where Lightning really shines. Payment channels can be linked together to find a path to the recipient. Alice does not need to have a channel open with David to send him some sats, the network will find the optimal path to route the payment through other channels. It could look something like this Alice > Bob > Charlie > David. Throughout the route the payment is cryptographically secured so that any intermediaries cannot steal any of the funds that don\u2019t belong to them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Who owns and controls the Lightning Network? Like Bitcoin, the Lightning Network is completely open source and not owned by any single entity. Anyone can run a node and participate in the network completely permission free. There are multiple popular implementations of Lightning which include LND, C Lightning and Eclair. All of these implementations are almost 100% interoperable."}
{"prompt": "Are there miners on the Lightning Network? No, the Lightning Network is built on top of the Bitcoin base layer and keeps all of the same security features. The minimal fees you pay on Lightning go to network participants who form part of the route your payment takes so it could be literally anyone running a Lightning node.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Does Lightning have its own blockchain? No, Lightning is a network of payment channels all interlinked together. All Lightning channel open and close transactions take place on the underlying Bitcoin protocol. Lightning inherits the Bitcoin blockchain\u2019s security."}
{"prompt": "What are the downsides of Lightning? For someone using the Lightning Network frequently with multiple channels, liquidity management can become tiresome. The network is relatively young and some payments can sometimes fail, but as development continues these instances are becoming far less common. Due to the structure of the network it is not as well suited to larger payments due to the liquidity restraints of each channel. This could change as the network grows and people gain confidence its reliability.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Do I need a node to use Lightning? Much like Bitcoin, you don\u2019t need a node to interact with the Lightning network but it is advisable. Remember, if you aren\u2019t running your own node, you are relying on someone else\u2019s. The good news is that most Bitcoin nodes these days come with a built in Lightning node too so you shouldn\u2019t have much extra work to do to get set up on Lightning."}
{"prompt": "What is inbound liquidity? Inbound liquidity is the measure how much bitcoin you can receive over the Lightning Network. If you simply open a channel to someone else, initially you can only send bitcoin. This is because all of the funds are on your side of the channel. If you opened a channel for 100k sats and then spent 25k, your inbound liquidity would be 25k sats. The better way to gain inbound liquidity is to have someone open a channel to you, that way all of the balance would be on their side of the channel.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is outbound liquidity? Outbound liquidity is the measure of how much bitcoin you can send over the Lightning Network. If you open a channel for 100k sats and spend 75k then your outbound liquidity is now 25k sats. Gaining outbound liquidity is as simple as receiving sats in your existing channels or opening a new channel with more sats. Remember, you can never spend more than the total size of your largest channel. Although this is set to change when Multi Path Payments get rolled out."}

{"prompt": "Why do we need Coinjoin? The Bitcoin blockchain is completely public, so if you have bitcoin that is tied to your personal identity (say from a KYC exchange) you can be followed on chain by anyone with the right resources that is surveilling the blockchain. This problem gets worse if you inadvertently combine bitcoin from different sources when making a transaction. You may feel like this isn\u2019t a problem and you have nothing to hide, but you wouldn\u2019t let a stranger look at your bank statement, so why allow it with Bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How does CoinJoin work? There are different types of Coinjoin implementations, each with their own take on the same basic idea. Two or more users pool their UTXO\u2019s together into a collaborative transaction that is formed in a unique way. The way the transaction is constructed makes it very difficult for surveillance firms to know exactly which transaction output belongs to which of the input owners. At best anyone looking at the transaction can come up with a number of possible scenarios as to who owns which piece of bitcoin but they can never be 100% sure."}
{"prompt": "Are there different types of Coinjoin? There are three popular implementations of Coinjoin, 1) Joinmarket which operates on a maker/taker structure where the maker offers up their bitcoin (for a fee) to become part of the taker\u2019s transaction. 2) Wasabi wallet which uses a desktop app and offers large mixes. The quality of which has come under some scrutiny. 3) Samourai Whirlpool offers small but effective Coinjoins coupled with an easy to use mobile interface. It\u2019s the only protocol we use.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Is a mixer the same as a Coinjoin? No, a mixer is generally considered to be a centralised service that you send bitcoin to, who then jumbles them around and sends you someone else\u2019s bitcoin back. These services should be avoided because you put your complete trust into the mixing entity to actually send you some bitcoin back after you have sent it. You should always be in control of your private keys!"}
{"prompt": "Do I have to pay for a Coinjoin? Yes, all of the Coinjoin services outlined above charge fees. Each one has a slightly different fee structure so you should always do your own research before starting to use any of them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Can I lose my bitcoin taking part in a Coinjoin? When using a Coinjoin service like those listed above, they are structured in a way so that you are always in control of your private keys. We are not currently aware instances of any users losing bitcoin as a result of an error with the protocol or due to any bad actor being behind one of them. With that said, you should also practice strict due diligence and if you are unsure then practice first using testnet bitcoin."}
{"prompt": "What problems can I face when using Coinjoin? There have been a couple of instances that exchanges has flagged users that have been tracked to or from a Coinjoin service. This has resulted in some having to provide KYC information and has resulted in others having their account blacklisted meaning that they could not use the exchange. For transparency we must state that all of these users were linked to the Wasabi Wallet implementation. The are no recorded issues with users of Joinmarket or Samourai Whirlpool being flagged.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What problems can I face when using Coinjoin? continued An often overlooked aspect of Coinjoin is what you do after the coinjoin takes place. Your spending habits after coinjoining, if not done correctly can completely undo all of the privacy gained. Post-mix spending can be a complex topic but tools such as Stonewall and Stowaway, implemented by Samourai Wallet are making this a much easier process."}
{"prompt": "What is Payjoin? Sometimes called Pay-to-end-point (P2EP), Payjoin is a special type of Coinjoin between two parties where one is actually paying the other. Due to the transaction structure, it\u2019s impossible to tell exactly the amount being transacted. Another great thing about Payjoin is that to blockchain surveillance firms a Payjoin looks just like a regular bitcoin transaction. If widely adopted, Payjoin will completely ruin the common input ownership heuristic for good.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What is chain analysis? Chain analysis is the practice of an entity surveilling the blockchain to look for clusters and patterns in transactions to try to track people or to understand their spending habits. Chain analysis firms do this under the guise that they are trying to stop criminals or terrorism. Whilst we do not disagree with the sentiment of fighting illegal activities that could cause harm to others, we do disagree with the drag net surveillance tools they use that infringe on the privacy of the common bitcoin user."}
{"prompt": "Where can I learn more about Coinjoin? Coinjoin is a very complex topic with lots of nuance so diligent research is absolutely necessary. Listen to this Stephan Livera podcast on the \u2018why\u2019 of Coinjoin and this one on the problem of blockchain surveillance. This article by @6102Bitcoin is a great run down of the three main Coinjoin implementations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By Bitcoin Q+A | Support | More resources"}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin is anonymous This is not true, Bitcoin is \u2018pseudonymous\u2019. Meaning that at a network level a wallet or address is not directly linked to a real life identity. This means that chain surveillance firms can follow and link together \u2018bitcoin identities\u2019 without knowing who the individuals behind them are. But, if you purchase bitcoin through an entity that requires personal information then those companies can tie together a real person and a bitcoin address. Always be mindful who you give this information to.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Bitcoin code could easily be changed This is just plain false. Bitcoin has become renowned (and sometimes criticised) for the length of time it takes to implement changes to its codebase. This is because any major changes to Bitcoin\u2019s code has to go through a rigorous peer review process before implementation. If this code change would result in a lack of backward compatibility (meaning older software may not be compatible) then the process becomes even slower and more rigourous."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin can be copied At a network level you can, and lots of people have. There are literally hundreds of copies of Bitcoin, each usually with a minor tweak to its code to \u2018improve\u2019 it. Almost always these \u2018improvements\u2019 come with huge tradeoffs that prevent them from gaining any traction on Bitcoin\u2019s massive network effects. These copies usually have an unfair launch which are generally carried out to enrich their founders. Their design usually makes it very difficult for the average user to run a node. This means the project becomes very centralised and a few parties have a large influence over any changes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There isn\u2019t enough Bitcoin for everyone on earth There will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. Each bitcoin contains 100 million satoshis. Which means there will be a total available supply of 2.1 quadrillion satoshis (thats 2,100,000,000,000,000) available to circulate around the Bitcoin network. At a world population of 8 billion (rounded up) that equates to 262,500 sats for every person on the planet. Plenty to go around, don\u2019t you think?"}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin is money for criminals Bitcoin is money and any money can be used by criminals. In 2017 the entire drug trafficking market alone was estimated to be worth $500,000,000,000 (500 billion). At current prices that could buy the entire Bitcoin network 11 times over! It\u2019s probably fair to say that the overwhelming majority of illicit activities are funded by normal \u2018fiat\u2019 currencies. It could also be argued that the public nature of Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain might actually make it less desirable for criminals.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Fees will make Bitcoin unusable in the future The Bitcoin network has a very efficient fee market. There have been some short lived spikes where transaction volumes grew exponentially resulting in higher fees. The average transaction fee in $ for the past 12 months is just 77 cents. We are personally of the opinion that fees will not rise significantly for at least the next couple of years, but when they inevitably do, we have Lightning which is a promising scaling solution that has matured a lot since its inception. You can read more on Lightning here."}
{"prompt": "Miners control Bitcoin Whilst it\u2019s true that the miners play a critical role in Bitcoin\u2019s operation, to say that they control the network is not. Miners are financially incentivised to act in good faith and the network only requires just over 50% of miners to be honest for the network to continue to function. In the highly unlikely event that a majority of nefarious miners got control of the network it would cost them over $300k per hour to sustain. If they were to succeed, not only would it be extremely costly but the price of bitcoin would likely plummet, making their efforts even less fruitful.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Miners will stop mining when the block subsidy drops Obviously nobody can be certain of this one as it\u2019s a future occurrence. But the common expectation is that as the block subsidy drops, fees will rise and miners will continue to be compensated for their work processing transactions and securing the network. By which point, the likelihood of there being a commonly accepted scaling solution such as Lightning will be far greater. Even if some miners stopped mining, thanks to the network\u2019s \u2018difficulty adjustment\u2019 it would still continue to function just fine and blocks would still be produced on average every 10 minutes."}
{"prompt": "Mining is bad for the environment It is true that Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work mining process consumes vast amounts of energy, but much of this now comes from renewable sources. Bitcoin is also pushing the development of energy capture by making use of sources that would otherwise be wasted such as flared natural gas. Bitcoin only consumes energy to the market\u2019s appetite. If more people choose to value and use bitcoin, then more energy will be dedicated to securing it. The opposite is also true.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin is too volatile Its certainly no secret that Bitcoin does have some monumental price movements. It is a relatively new financial asset that the market is still trying to understand. This is why it is always good advice not to try and trade the market for profit. By adopting the strategy of making smaller more frequent purchases you effectively ignore Bitcoin\u2019s price volatility and obtain the \u2018market average\u2019 price. Not financial advice."}

{"prompt": "Users can transfer bitcoin over the network to do just about anything that can be done with conventional currencies, including buying and selling goods, sending money to people or organizations, or extending credit. Bitcoin can be purchased, sold, and exchanged for other currencies at specialized currency exchanges. Bitcoin in a sense is the perfect form of money for the internet because it is fast, secure, and borderless.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Unlike traditional currencies, bitcoin is entirely virtual. There are no physical coins or even digital coins per se. The coins are implied in transactions that transfer value from sender to recipient. Users of Bitcoin own keys that allow them to prove ownership of bitcoin in the Bitcoin network. With these keys, they can sign transactions to unlock the value and spend it by transferring it to a new owner. Keys are often stored in a digital wallet on each user\u2019s computer or smartphone. Possession of the key that can sign a transaction is the only prerequisite to spending bitcoin, putting the control entirely in the hands of each user."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin is a distributed, peer-to-peer system. As such, there is no \"central\" server or point of control. Bitcoins, i.e. units of bitcoin, are created through a process called \"mining,\" which involves competing to find solutions to a mathematical problem while processing Bitcoin transactions. Any participant in the Bitcoin network (i.e., anyone using a device running the full Bitcoin protocol stack) may operate as a miner, using their computer\u2019s processing power to verify and record transactions. Every 10 minutes, on average, a Bitcoin miner can validate the transactions of the past 10 minutes and is rewarded with brand new bitcoin. Essentially, Bitcoin mining decentralizes the currency-issuance and clearing functions of a central bank and replaces the need for any central bank.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Bitcoin protocol includes built-in algorithms that regulate the mining function across the network. The difficulty of the processing task that miners must perform is adjusted dynamically so that, on average, someone succeeds every 10 minutes regardless of how many miners (and how much processing) are competing at any moment. The protocol also halves the rate at which new bitcoin is created every 4 years, and limits the total number of bitcoin that will be created to a fixed total just below 21 million coins. The result is that the number of bitcoin in circulation closely follows an easily predictable curve that approaches 21 million by the year 2140. Due to bitcoin\u2019s diminishing rate of issuance, over the long term, the Bitcoin currency is deflationary. Furthermore, bitcoin cannot be inflated by \"printing\" new money above and beyond the expected issuance rate."}
{"prompt": "Behind the scenes, Bitcoin is also the name of the protocol, a peer-to-peer network, and a distributed computing innovation. The bitcoin currency is really only the first application of this invention. Bitcoin represents the culmination of decades of research in cryptography and distributed systems and includes four key innovations brought together in a unique and powerful combination.

{"prompt": "A mechanism for reaching global decentralized consensus on the valid blockchain (Proof-of-Work algorithm)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As a developer, I see Bitcoin as akin to the internet of money, a network for propagating value and securing the ownership of digital assets via distributed computation. There\u2019s a lot more to Bitcoin than first meets the eye."}
{"prompt": "The emergence of viable digital money is closely linked to developments in cryptography. This is not surprising when one considers the fundamental challenges involved with using bits to represent value that can be exchanged for goods and services. Three basic questions for anyone accepting digital money are:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Can I trust that the money is authentic and not counterfeit?"}
{"prompt": "Can I trust that the digital money can only be spent once (known as the \u201cdouble-spend\u201d problem)?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Can I be sure that no one else can claim this money belongs to them and not me?"}
{"prompt": "Issuers of paper money are constantly battling the counterfeiting problem by using increasingly sophisticated papers and printing technology. Physical money addresses the double-spend issue easily because the same paper note cannot be in two places at once. Of course, conventional money is also often stored and transmitted digitally. In these cases, the counterfeiting and double-spend issues are handled by clearing all electronic transactions through central authorities that have a global view of the currency in circulation. For digital money, which cannot take advantage of esoteric inks or holographic strips, cryptography provides the basis for trusting the legitimacy of a user\u2019s claim to value. Specifically, cryptographic digital signatures enable a user to sign a digital asset or transaction proving the ownership of that asset. With the appropriate architecture, digital signatures also can be used to address the double-spend issue.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When cryptography started becoming more broadly available and understood in the late 1980s, many researchers began trying to use cryptography to build digital currencies. These early digital currency projects issued digital money, usually backed by a national currency or precious metal such as gold."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin was invented in 2008 with the publication of a paper titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\"[1] written under the alias of Satoshi Nakamoto (see [satoshi_whitepaper]). Nakamoto combined several prior inventions such as b-money and HashCash to create a completely decentralized electronic cash system that does not rely on a central authority for currency issuance or settlement and validation of transactions. The key innovation was to use a distributed computation system (called a \"Proof-of-Work\" algorithm) to conduct a global \"election\" every 10 minutes, allowing the decentralized network to arrive at consensus about the state of transactions. This elegantly solves the issue of double-spend where a single currency unit can be spent twice. Previously, the double-spend problem was a weakness of digital currency and was addressed by clearing all transactions through a central clearinghouse.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Bitcoin network started in 2009, based on a reference implementation published by Nakamoto and since revised by many other programmers. The implementation of the Proof-of-Work algorithm (mining) that provides security and resilience for Bitcoin has increased in power exponentially, and now exceeds the combined processing power of the world\u2019s top supercomputers. Bitcoin\u2019s total market value has at times exceeded $1 trillion US dollars, depending on the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate. The largest transaction processed so far by the network was $1.1 billion US dollars, transmitted instantly and processed for a fee of only $0.68."}

{"prompt": "Hardware wallets are devices that operate a secure self-contained Bitcoin wallet on special-purpose hardware. They usually connect to a desktop or mobile device via USB cable or near-field-communication (NFC), and are operated with a web browser or accompanying software.

If she doesn\u2019t protect it enough, her mnemonic will be at risk of being stolen. If she protects it too much, her mnemonic will be at risk of being permanently lost. The recommended way to properly balance these risks is to write two copies of the mnemonic phrase on paper, with each of the words numbered as the order matters.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Once Alice has recorded the mnemonic phrase, she should plan to store each copy in a separate secure location such as a locked desk drawer or a fireproof safe."}

{"prompt": "Alice is now ready to start using her new bitcoin wallet. Her wallet application randomly generated a private key (described in more detail in [private_keys]) which will be used to derive Bitcoin addresses that direct to her wallet. At this point, her Bitcoin addresses are not known to the Bitcoin network or \"registered\" with any part of the Bitcoin system. Her Bitcoin addresses are simply random numbers that correspond to her private key that she can use to control access to the funds. The addresses are generated independently by her wallet without reference or registration with any service. In fact, in most wallets, there is no association between a Bitcoin address and any externally identifiable information including the user\u2019s identity. Until the moment an address is referenced as the recipient of value in a transaction posted on the bitcoin ledger, the Bitcoin address is simply part of the vast number of possible addresses that are valid in bitcoin. Only once an address has been associated with a transaction does it become part of the known addresses in the network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Alice uses the Receive button, which displays a QR code along with a Bitcoin address.

Next to the wallet\u2019s QR code is the Bitcoin address it encodes, and Alice may choose to manually send her address to Joe by copying it onto her clipboard with a tap. Of note, when receiving funds to a new mobile wallet for the first time, many wallets will often re-verify that you have indeed secured your mnemonic phrase. This can range from a simple prompt to requiring the user to manually re-enter the phrase."}

For simplicity sake, we will assume that Joe does not pay any transaction fees. The purpose and setting of transaction fees are covered in subsequent chapters. After double-checking the address and amount, he presses Send to transmit the transaction. Joe\u2019s mobile bitcoin wallet constructs a transaction that assigns 0.10 BTC to the address provided by Alice, sourcing the funds from Joe\u2019s wallet and signing the transaction with Joe\u2019s private keys. This tells the Bitcoin network that Joe has authorized a transfer of value to Alice\u2019s new address. As the transaction is transmitted via the peer-to-peer protocol, it quickly propagates across the Bitcoin network.

{"prompt": "Transactions are like lines in a double-entry bookkeeping ledger. Each transaction contains one or more \"inputs,\" which are like debits against a bitcoin account. On the other side of the transaction, there are one or more \"outputs,\" which are like credits added to a bitcoin account. The inputs and outputs (debits and credits) do not necessarily add up to the same amount. Instead, outputs add up to slightly less than inputs and the difference represents an implied transaction fee, which is a small payment collected by the miner who includes the transaction in the ledger. A bitcoin transaction is shown as a bookkeeping ledger entry in Transaction as double-entry bookkeeping.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The transaction also contains proof of ownership for each amount of bitcoin (inputs) whose value is being spent, in the form of a digital signature from the owner, which can be independently validated by anyone. In bitcoin terms, \"spending\" is signing a transaction that transfers value from a previous transaction over to a new owner identified by a Bitcoin address."}
{"prompt": "Alice\u2019s payment to Bob\u2019s Cafe uses a previous transaction\u2019s output as its input. In the previous chapter, Alice received bitcoin from her friend Joe in return for cash. That transaction created a bitcoin value locked by Alice\u2019s key. Her new transaction to Bob\u2019s Cafe references the previous transaction as an input and creates new outputs to pay for the cup of coffee and receive change. The transactions form a chain, where the inputs from the latest transaction correspond to outputs from previous transactions. Alice\u2019s key provides the signature that unlocks those previous transaction outputs, thereby proving to the Bitcoin network that she owns the funds. She attaches the payment for coffee to Bob\u2019s address, thereby \"encumbering\" that output with the requirement that Bob produces a signature in order to spend that amount. This represents a transfer of value between Alice and Bob. This chain of transactions, from Joe to Alice to Bob, is illustrated in A chain of transactions, where the output of one transaction is the input of the next transaction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Figure 4. A chain of transactions, where the output of one transaction is the input of the next transaction"}
{"prompt": "Different wallets may use different strategies when aggregating inputs to make a payment requested by the user. They might aggregate many small inputs, or use one that is equal to or larger than the desired payment. Unless the wallet can aggregate inputs in such a way to exactly match the desired payment plus transaction fees, the wallet will need to generate some change. This is very similar to how people handle cash. If you always use the largest bill in your pocket, you will end up with a pocket full of loose change. If you only use the loose change, you\u2019ll always have only big bills. People subconsciously find a balance between these two extremes, and bitcoin wallet developers strive to program this balance.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In summary, transactions move value from transaction inputs to transaction outputs. An input is a reference to a previous transaction\u2019s output, showing where the value is coming from. A transaction usually includes an output that directs a specific value to a new owner\u2019s Bitcoin address and a change output back to the original owner. Outputs from one transaction can be used as inputs in a new transaction, thus creating a chain of ownership as the value is moved from owner to owner (see A chain of transactions, where the output of one transaction is the input of the next transaction)."}
{"prompt": "Alice\u2019s wallet application will first have to find inputs that can pay the amount she wants to send to Bob. Most wallets keep track of all the available outputs belonging to addresses in the wallet. Therefore, Alice\u2019s wallet would contain a copy of the transaction output from Joe\u2019s transaction, which was created in exchange for cash (see [getting_first_bitcoin]). A bitcoin wallet application that runs as a full-node client actually contains a copy of every unspent output from every transaction in the blockchain. This allows a wallet to construct transaction inputs as well as quickly verify incoming transactions as having correct inputs. However, because a full-node client takes up a lot of disk space, most user wallets run \"lightweight\" clients that track only the user\u2019s own unspent outputs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If the wallet application does not maintain a copy of unspent transaction outputs, it can query the Bitcoin network to retrieve this information using a variety of APIs available by different providers or by asking a full-node using an application programming interface (API) call. Look up all the unspent outputs for Alice\u2019s Bitcoin address shows an API request, constructed as an HTTP GET command to a specific URL. This URL will return all the unspent transaction outputs for an address, giving any application the information it needs to construct transaction inputs for spending. We use the simple command-line HTTP client cURL to retrieve the response."}
{"prompt": "This transaction will also include a second output, because Alice\u2019s funds are in the form of a 0.10 BTC output, too much money for the 0.015 BTC cup of coffee. Alice will need 0.085 BTC in change. Alice\u2019s change payment is created by Alice\u2019s wallet as an output in the very same transaction as the payment to Bob. Essentially, Alice\u2019s wallet breaks her funds into two payments: one to Bob and one back to herself. She can then use (spend) the change output in a subsequent transaction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Finally, for the transaction to be processed by the network in a timely fashion, Alice\u2019s wallet application will add a small fee. This is not explicit in the transaction; it is implied by the difference between inputs and outputs. If instead of taking 0.085 in change, Alice creates only 0.0845 as the second output, there will be 0.0005 BTC (half a millibitcoin) left over. The input\u2019s 0.10 BTC is not fully spent with the two outputs, because they will add up to less than 0.10. The resulting difference is the transaction fee that is collected by the miner as a fee for validating and including the transaction in a block to be recorded on the blockchain."}
{"prompt": "The resulting transaction can be seen using a blockchain explorer web application, as shown in Alice\u2019s transaction to Bob\u2019s Cafe.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Figure 8. Alice\u2019s transaction to Bob\u2019s Cafe"}
{"prompt": "The Bitcoin system of trust is based on computation. Transactions are bundled into blocks, which require an enormous amount of computation to prove, but only a small amount of computation to verify as proven. The mining process serves two purposes in bitcoin:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mining nodes validate all transactions by reference to bitcoin\u2019s consensus rules. Therefore, mining provides security for bitcoin transactions by rejecting invalid or malformed transactions."}
{"prompt": "Mining creates new bitcoin in each block, almost like a central bank printing new money. The amount of bitcoin created per block is limited and diminishes with time, following a fixed issuance schedule.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mining achieves a fine balance between cost and reward. Mining uses electricity to solve a mathematical problem. A successful miner will collect a reward in the form of new bitcoin and transaction fees. However, the reward will only be collected if the miner has correctly validated all the transactions, to the satisfaction of the rules of consensus. This delicate balance provides security for bitcoin without a central authority."}
{"prompt": "A good way to describe mining is like a giant competitive game of sudoku that resets every time someone finds a solution and whose difficulty automatically adjusts so that it takes approximately 10 minutes to find a solution. Imagine a giant sudoku puzzle, several thousand rows and columns in size. If I show you a completed puzzle you can verify it quite quickly. However, if the puzzle has a few squares filled and the rest are empty, it takes a lot of work to solve! The difficulty of the sudoku can be adjusted by changing its size (more or fewer rows and columns), but it can still be verified quite easily even if it is very large. The \"puzzle\" used in bitcoin is based on a cryptographic hash and exhibits similar characteristics: it is asymmetrically hard to solve but easy to verify, and its difficulty can be adjusted.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In [user-stories], we introduced Jing, an entrepreneur in Shanghai. Jing runs a mining farm, which is a business that runs thousands of specialized mining computers, competing for the reward. Every 10 minutes or so, Jing\u2019s mining computers compete against thousands of similar systems in a global race to find a solution to a block of transactions. Finding such a solution, the so-called Proof-of-Work (PoW), requires quadrillions of hashing operations per second across the entire Bitcoin network. The algorithm for Proof-of-Work involves repeatedly hashing the header of the block and a random number with the SHA256 cryptographic algorithm until a solution matching a predetermined pattern emerges. The first miner to find such a solution wins the round of competition and publishes that block into the blockchain."}
{"prompt": "New transactions are constantly flowing into the network from user wallets and other applications. As these are seen by the Bitcoin network nodes, they get added to a temporary pool of unverified transactions maintained by each node. As miners construct a new block, they add unverified transactions from this pool to the new block and then attempt to prove the validity of that new block, with the mining algorithm (Proof-of-Work). The process of mining is explained in detail in [mining].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Transactions are added to the new block, prioritized by the highest-fee transactions first and a few other criteria. Each miner starts the process of mining a new block of transactions as soon as they receive the previous block from the network, knowing they have lost that previous round of competition. They immediately create a new block, fill it with transactions and the fingerprint of the previous block, and start calculating the Proof-of-Work for the new block. Each miner includes a special transaction in their block, one that pays their own Bitcoin address the block reward (currently 6.25 newly created bitcoin) plus the sum of transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block. If they find a solution that makes that block valid, they \"win\" this reward because their successful block is added to the global blockchain and the reward transaction they included becomes spendable. Jing, who participates in a mining pool, has set up his software to create new blocks that assign the reward to a pool address. From there, a share of the reward is distributed to Jing and other miners in proportion to the amount of work they contributed in the last round."}
{"prompt": "Alice\u2019s transaction was picked up by the network and included in the pool of unverified transactions. Once validated by the mining software it was included in a new block, called a candidate block, generated by Jing\u2019s mining pool. All the miners participating in that mining pool immediately start computing Proof-of-Work for the candidate block. Approximately five minutes after the transaction was first transmitted by Alice\u2019s wallet, one of Jing\u2019s ASIC miners found a solution for the candidate block and announced it to the network. Once other miners validated the winning block they started the race to generate the next block.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jing\u2019s winning block became part of the blockchain as block #277316, containing 419 transactions, including Alice\u2019s transaction. The block containing Alice\u2019s transaction is counted as one \"confirmation\" of that transaction."}
{"prompt": "Approximately 20 minutes later, a new block, #277317, is mined by another miner. Because this new block is built on top of block #277316 that contained Alice\u2019s transaction, it added even more computation to the blockchain, thereby strengthening the trust in those transactions. Each block mined on top of the one containing the transaction counts as an additional confirmation for Alice\u2019s transaction. As the blocks pile on top of each other, it becomes exponentially harder to reverse the transaction, thereby making it more and more trusted by the network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the diagram in Alice\u2019s transaction included in block #277316, we can see block #277316, which contains Alice\u2019s transaction. Below it are 277,316 blocks (including block #0), linked to each other in a chain of blocks (blockchain) all the way back to block #0, known as the genesis block. Over time, as the \"height\" in blocks increases, so does the computation difficulty for each block and the chain as a whole. The blocks mined after the one that contains Alice\u2019s transaction act as further assurance, as they pile on more computation in a longer and longer chain. By convention, any block with more than six confirmations is considered irrevocable, because it would require an immense amount of computation to invalidate and recalculate six blocks. We will examine the process of mining and the way it builds trust in more detail in [mining]."}
{"prompt": "Now that Alice\u2019s transaction has been embedded in the blockchain as part of a block, it is part of the distributed ledger of bitcoin and visible to all bitcoin applications. Each Bitcoin client can independently verify the transaction as valid and spendable. Full-node clients can track the source of the funds from the moment the bitcoin were first generated in a block, incrementally from transaction to transaction, until they reach Bob\u2019s address. Lightweight clients can do what is called a simplified payment verification (see [spv_nodes]) by confirming that the transaction is in the blockchain and has several blocks mined after it, thus providing assurance that the miners accepted it as valid.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bob can now spend the output from this and other transactions. For example, Bob can pay a contractor or supplier by transferring value from Alice\u2019s coffee cup payment to these new owners. Most likely, Bob\u2019s bitcoin software will aggregate many small payments into a larger payment, perhaps concentrating all the day\u2019s bitcoin revenue into a single transaction. This would aggregate the various payments into a single output (and a single address). For a diagram of an aggregating transaction, see Transaction aggregating funds."}
{"prompt": "As Bob spends the payments received from Alice and other customers, he extends the chain of transactions. Let\u2019s assume that Bob pays his web designer Gopesh in Bangalore for a new web page.

The digital keys are not actually stored in the network, but are instead created and stored by users in a file, or simple database, called a wallet. The digital keys in a user\u2019s wallet are completely independent of the Bitcoin protocol and can be generated and managed by the user\u2019s wallet software without reference to the blockchain or access to the internet. Keys enable many of the interesting properties of bitcoin, including decentralized trust and control, ownership attestation, and the cryptographic-proof security model.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Most bitcoin transactions require a valid digital signature to be included in the blockchain, which can only be generated with a secret key; therefore, anyone with a copy of that key has control of the bitcoin. The digital signature used to spend funds is also referred to as a witness, a term used in cryptography. The witness data in a bitcoin transaction testifies to the true ownership of the funds being spent."}
{"prompt": "Keys come in pairs consisting of a private (secret) key and a public key. Think of the public key as similar to a bank account number and the private key as similar to the secret PIN, or signature on a check, that provides control over the account.

For the most part, they are stored inside the wallet file and managed by the bitcoin wallet software.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the payment portion of a bitcoin transaction, the recipient\u2019s public key is represented by its digital fingerprint, called a Bitcoin address, which is used in the same way as the beneficiary name on a check (i.e., \"Pay to the order of\"). In most cases, a Bitcoin address is generated from and corresponds to a public key. However, not all Bitcoin addresses represent public keys; they can also represent other beneficiaries such as scripts, as we will see later in this chapter. This way, Bitcoin addresses abstract the recipient of funds, making transaction destinations flexible, similar to paper checks: a single payment instrument that can be used to pay into people\u2019s accounts, pay into company accounts, pay for bills, or pay to cash. The Bitcoin address is the only representation of the keys that users will routinely see, because this is the part they need to share with the world."}

{"prompt": "Public key cryptography was invented in the 1970s and is a mathematical foundation for computer and information security.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Since the invention of public key cryptography, several suitable mathematical functions, such as prime number exponentiation and elliptic curve multiplication, have been discovered. These mathematical functions are practically irreversible, meaning that they are easy to calculate in one direction and infeasible to calculate in the opposite direction. Based on these mathematical functions, cryptography enables the creation of digital secrets and unforgeable digital signatures. Bitcoin uses elliptic curve multiplication as the basis for its cryptography."}
{"prompt": "In bitcoin, we use public key cryptography to create a key pair that controls access to bitcoin. The key pair consists of a private key and\u2014derived from it\u2014a unique public key. The public key is used to receive funds, and the private key is used to sign transactions to spend the funds.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There is a mathematical relationship between the public and the private key that allows the private key to be used to generate signatures on messages. These signatures can be validated against the public key without revealing the private key."}
{"prompt": "A bitcoin wallet contains a collection of key pairs, each consisting of a private key and a public key. The private key (k) is a number, usually picked at random. From the private key, we use elliptic curve multiplication, a one-way cryptographic function, to generate a public key (K). From the public key (K), we use a one-way cryptographic hash function to generate a Bitcoin address (A). In this section, we will start with generating the private key, look at the elliptic curve math that is used to turn that into a public key, and finally, generate a Bitcoin address from the public key. The relationship between private key, public key, and Bitcoin address is shown in Private key, public key, and Bitcoin address.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Figure 1.

{"prompt": "Why Use Asymmetric Cryptography (Public/Private Keys)?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Why is asymmetric cryptography used in bitcoin? It\u2019s not used to \"encrypt\" (make secret) the transactions. Rather, the useful property of asymmetric cryptography is the ability to generate digital signatures. A private key can be applied to the digital fingerprint of a transaction to produce a numerical signature. This signature can only be produced by someone with knowledge of the private key. However, anyone with access to the public key and the transaction fingerprint can use them to verify the signature. This useful property of asymmetric cryptography makes it possible for anyone to verify every signature on every transaction, while ensuring that only the owners of private keys can produce valid signatures."}
{"prompt": "Generating a private key from a random number\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The first and most important step in generating keys is to find a secure source of entropy, or randomness. Creating a bitcoin key is essentially the same as \"Pick a number between 1 and 2256.\" The exact method you use to pick that number does not matter as long as it is not predictable or repeatable. Bitcoin software uses the underlying operating system\u2019s random number generators to produce 256 bits of entropy (randomness). Usually, the OS random number generator is initialized by a human source of randomness, which is why you may be asked to wiggle your mouse around for a few seconds."}

Most transactions include the public key, which is required to validate the owner\u2019s credentials and spend the bitcoin.

That allows us to store only the x coordinate of the public key point, omitting the y coordinate and reducing the size of the key and the space required to store it by 256 bits. An almost 50% reduction in size in every transaction adds up to a lot of data saved over time!"}
{"prompt": "Whereas uncompressed public keys have a prefix of 04, compressed public keys start with either a 02 or a 03 prefix. Let\u2019s look at why there are two possible prefixes: because the left side of the equation is y2, the solution for y is a square root, which can have a positive or negative value. Visually, this means that the resulting y coordinate can be above or below the x-axis. As you can see from the graph of the elliptic curve in An elliptic curve, the curve is symmetric, meaning it is reflected like a mirror by the x-axis. So, while we can omit the y coordinate we have to store the sign of y (positive or negative); or in other words, we have to remember if it was above or below the x-axis because each of those options represents a different point and a different public key. When calculating the elliptic curve in binary arithmetic on the finite field of prime order p, the y coordinate is either even or odd, which corresponds to the positive/negative sign as explained earlier. Therefore, to distinguish between the two possible values of y, we store a compressed public key with the prefix 02 if the y is even, and 03 if it is odd, allowing the software to correctly deduce the y coordinate from the x coordinate and uncompress the public key to the full coordinates of the point.

{"prompt": "Ironically, the term \"compressed private key\" is a misnomer, because when a private key is exported as WIF-compressed it is actually one byte longer than an \"uncompressed\" private key.

Private keys are not themselves compressed and cannot be compressed. The term \"compressed private key\" really means \"private key from which only compressed public keys should be derived,\" whereas \"uncompressed private key\" really means \"private key from which only uncompressed public keys should be derived.\" You should only refer to the export format as \"WIF-compressed\" or \"WIF\" and not refer to the private key itself as \"compressed\" to avoid further confusion.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Example: Same key, different formats shows the same key, encoded in WIF and WIF-compressed formats."}

Think of this as the Base58 equivalent of the decimal encoding difference between the number 100 and the number 99. While 100 is one digit longer than 99, it also has a prefix of 1 instead of a prefix of 9. As the length changes, it affects the prefix. In Base58, the prefix 5 changes to a K or L as the length of the number increases by one byte.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Remember, these formats are not used interchangeably.

{"prompt": "Vanity addresses can be used to enhance and to defeat security measures; they are truly a double-edged sword. Used to improve security, a distinctive address makes it harder for adversaries to substitute their own address and fool your customers into paying them instead of you.

{"prompt": "Extended keys are encoded using Base58Check, to easily export and import between different BIP-32\u2013compatible wallets. The Base58Check coding for extended keys uses a special version number that results in the prefix \"xprv\" and \"xpub\" when encoded in Base58 characters to make them easily recognizable.

{"prompt": "As mentioned previously, a very useful characteristic of HD wallets is the ability to derive public child keys from public parent keys, without having the private keys. This gives us two ways to derive a child public key: either from the child private key, or directly from the parent public key.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " An extended public key can be used, therefore, to derive all of the public keys (and only the public keys) in that branch of the HD wallet structure."}
{"prompt": "This shortcut can be used to create very secure public key\u2013only deployments where a server or application has a copy of an extended public key and no private keys whatsoever. That kind of deployment can produce an infinite number of public keys and Bitcoin addresses, but cannot spend any of the money sent to those addresses. Meanwhile, on another, more secure server, the extended private key can derive all the corresponding private keys to sign transactions and spend the money.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One common application of this solution is to install an extended public key on a web server that serves an ecommerce application. The web server can use the public key derivation function to create a new Bitcoin address for every transaction (e.g., for a customer shopping cart). The web server will not have any private keys that would be vulnerable to theft. Without HD wallets, the only way to do this is to generate thousands of Bitcoin addresses on a separate secure server and then preload them on the ecommerce server. That approach is cumbersome and requires constant maintenance to ensure that the ecommerce server doesn\u2019t \"run out\" of addresses."}
{"prompt": "Another common application of this solution is for cold-storage or hardware wallets. In that scenario, the extended private key can be stored on a paper wallet or hardware device (such as a Trezor hardware wallet), while the extended public key can be kept online. The user can create \"receive\" addresses at will, while the private keys are safely stored offline. To spend the funds, the user can use the extended private key on an offline signing Bitcoin client or sign transactions on the hardware wallet device (e.g., Trezor). Extending a parent public key to create a child public key illustrates the mechanism for extending a parent public key to derive child public keys.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Figure 10. Extending a parent public key to create a child public key"}
{"prompt": "To counter this risk, HD wallets use an alternative derivation function called hardened derivation, which \"breaks\" the relationship between parent public key and child chain code. The hardened derivation function uses the parent private key to derive the child chain code, instead of the parent public key. This creates a \"firewall\" in the parent/child sequence, with a chain code that cannot be used to compromise a parent or sibling private key. The hardened derivation function looks almost identical to the normal child private key derivation, except that the parent private key is used as input to the hash function, instead of the parent public key, as shown in the diagram in Hardened derivation of a child key; omits the parent public key.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Figure 11. Hardened derivation of a child key; omits the parent public key"}
{"prompt": "When the hardened private derivation function is used, the resulting child private key and chain code are completely different from what would result from the normal derivation function. The resulting \"branch\" of keys can be used to produce extended public keys that are not vulnerable, because the chain code they contain cannot be exploited to reveal any private keys. Hardened derivation is therefore used to create a \"gap\" in the tree above the level where extended public keys are used.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In simple terms, if you want to use the convenience of an xpub to derive branches of public keys, without exposing yourself to the risk of a leaked chain code, you should derive it from a hardened parent key, rather than a normal (non-hardened) parent key. As a best practice, the level-1 children of the master keys are always derived through the hardened derivation, to prevent compromise of the master keys."}
{"prompt": "Index numbers for normal and hardened derivation\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The index number used in the derivation function is a 32-bit integer. To easily distinguish between keys derived through the normal derivation function versus keys derived through hardened derivation, this index number is split into two ranges. Index numbers between 0 and 231\u20131 (0x0 to 0x7FFFFFFF) are used only for normal derivation. Index numbers between 231 and 232\u20131 (0x80000000 to 0xFFFFFFFF) are used only for hardened derivation. Therefore, if the index number is less than 231, the child is normal, whereas if the index number is equal or above 231, the child is hardened."}
{"prompt": "Keys in an HD wallet are identified using a \"path\" naming convention, with each level of the tree separated by a slash (/) character (see HD wallet path examples). Private keys derived from the master private key start with \"m.\" Public keys derived from the master public key start with \"M.\" Therefore, the first child private key of the master private key is m/0. The first child public key is M/0. The second grandchild of the first child is m/0/1, and so on.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The \"ancestry\" of a key is read from right to left, until you reach the master key from which it was derived. For example, identifier m/x/y/z describes the private key that is the z-th child of the parent private key m/x/y, which is the y-th child of the parent private key m/x, which is the x-th child of the parent master private key m."}
{"prompt": "Two BIPs offer a solution to this complexity by creating some proposed standards for the structure of HD wallet trees. BIP-43 proposes the use of the first hardened child index as a special identifier that signifies the \"purpose\" of the tree structure. Based on BIP-43, an HD wallet should use only one level-1 branch of the tree, with the index number identifying the structure and namespace of the rest of the tree by defining its purpose. For example, an HD wallet using only branch m/i&#x27;/ is intended to signify a specific purpose and that purpose is identified by index number \"i.\"\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Extending that specification, BIP-44 proposes a multiaccount structure as \"purpose\" number 44' under BIP-43. All HD wallets following the BIP-44 structure are identified by the fact that they only used one branch of the tree: m/44'/."}

{"prompt": "The first-level \"purpose\" is always set to 44'. The second-level \"coin_type\" specifies the type of cryptocurrency coin, allowing for multicurrency HD wallets where each currency has its own subtree under the second level.

For example, an HD wallet might contain two bitcoin \"accounts\": m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27; and m/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/1&#x27;. Each account is the root of its own subtree."}
{"prompt": "On the fourth level, \"change,\" an HD wallet has two subtrees, one for creating receiving addresses and one for creating change addresses. Note that whereas the previous levels used hardened derivation, this level uses normal derivation. This is to allow this level of the tree to export extended public keys for use in a nonsecured environment. Usable addresses are derived by the HD wallet as children of the fourth level, making the fifth level of the tree the \"address_index.\" For example, the third receiving address for bitcoin payments in the primary account would be M/44&#x27;/0&#x27;/0&#x27;/0/2.

The collection of all UTXO is known as the UTXO set and currently numbers in the millions of UTXO. The UTXO set grows as new UTXO is created and shrinks when UTXO is consumed.

The concept of a balance is created by the wallet application. The wallet calculates the user\u2019s balance by scanning the blockchain and aggregating the value of any UTXO the wallet can spend with the keys it controls.

Transaction fees affect the processing priority, meaning that a transaction with sufficient fees is likely to be included in the next block mined, whereas a transaction with insufficient or no fees might be delayed, processed on a best-effort basis after a few blocks, or not processed at all. Transaction fees are not mandatory, and transactions without fees might be processed eventually; however, including transaction fees encourages priority processing."}

At first, transaction fees were fixed and constant across the network. Gradually, the fee structure relaxed and may be influenced by market forces, based on network capacity and transaction volume.

We saw that transactions don\u2019t contain Bitcoin addresses, per se, but instead operate through scripts that lock and unlock discrete values of bitcoin. Balances are not present anywhere in this system and yet every wallet application prominently displays the balance of the user\u2019s wallet."}

Once again, to create these Bitcoin addresses, the blockchain explorer extracted the locking script from each output, recognized it as a P2PKH script, and extracted the public-key-hash from within.

Then, the blockchain explorer will search through the database of transactions, looking for outputs with P2PKH locking scripts that contain Bob\u2019s public key hash. By summing up the value of all the outputs, the blockchain explorer can produce the total value received.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Constructing the current balance (displayed as \"Final Balance\") requires a bit more work. The blockchain explorer keeps a separate database of the outputs that are currently unspent, the UTXO set. To maintain this database, the blockchain explorer must monitor the Bitcoin network, add newly created UTXO, and remove spent UTXO, in real time, as they appear in unconfirmed transactions. This is a complicated process that depends on keeping track of transactions as they propagate, as well as maintaining consensus with the Bitcoin network to ensure that the correct chain is followed. Sometimes, the blockchain explorer goes out of sync and its perspective of the UTXO set is incomplete or incorrect."}

{"prompt": "In summary, the information presented to users through wallet applications, blockchain explorers, and other bitcoin user interfaces is often composed of higher-level abstractions that are derived by searching many different transactions, inspecting their content, and manipulating the data contained within them. By presenting this simplistic view of bitcoin transactions that resemble bank checks from one sender to one recipient, these applications have to abstract a lot of underlying details. They mostly focus on the common types of transactions: P2PKH with SIGHASH_ALL signatures on every input. Thus, while bitcoin applications can present more than 80% of all transactions in an easy-to-read manner, they are sometimes stumped by transactions that deviate from the norm. Transactions that contain more complex locking scripts, or different SIGHASH flags, or many inputs and outputs, demonstrate the simplicity and weakness of these abstractions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Every day, hundreds of transactions that do not contain P2PKH outputs are confirmed on the blockchain. The blockchain explorers often present these with red warning messages saying they cannot decode an address."}
{"prompt": "Multisignature scripts set a condition where N public keys are recorded in the script and at least M of those must provide signatures to unlock the funds.

Note that the limit of 3 keys applies only to standard (also known as \"bare\") multisignature scripts, not to multisignature scripts wrapped in a Pay-to-Script-Hash (P2SH) script. P2SH multisignature scripts are limited to 15 keys, allowing for up to 15-of-15 multisignature. This limitation is also imposed by the IsStandard() function.

Then, it pops one item, which is M, the quorum (how many signatures are needed). Here M = 2. At this point, CHECKMULTISIG should pop the final M items, which are the signatures, and see if they are valid. However, unfortunately, a bug in the implementation causes CHECKMULTISIG to pop one more item (M+1 total) than it should. The extra item is disregarded when checking the signatures so it has no direct effect on CHECKMULTISIG itself. However, an extra value must be present because if it is not present, when CHECKMULTISIG attempts to pop on an empty stack, it will cause a stack error and script failure (marking the transaction as invalid). Because the extra item is disregarded it can be anything, but customarily 0 is used.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Because this bug became part of the consensus rules, it must now be replicated forever.

With the multisignature scheme, any payments made by customers are locked in such a way that they require at least two signatures to release, from Mohammed and one of his partners or from his attorney who has a backup key.

Given the preceding script, Mohammed would have to communicate this script to every customer prior to payment. Each customer would have to use special bitcoin wallet software with the ability to create custom transaction scripts, and each customer would have to understand how to create a transaction using custom scripts. Furthermore, the resulting transaction would be about five times larger than a simple payment transaction, because this script contains very long public keys. The burden of that extra-large transaction would be borne by the customer in the form of fees. Finally, a large transaction script like this would be carried in the UTXO set in RAM in every full node, until it was spent. All of these issues make using complex locking scripts difficult in practice."}
{"prompt": "P2SH was developed to resolve these practical difficulties and to make the use of complex scripts as easy as a payment to a Bitcoin address. With P2SH payments, the complex locking script is replaced with its digital fingerprint, a cryptographic hash.

{"prompt": "Bitcoin\u2019s distributed and timestamped ledger, the blockchain, has potential uses far beyond payments. Many developers have tried to use the transaction scripting language to take advantage of the security and resilience of the system for applications such as digital notary services, stock certificates, and smart contracts. Early attempts to use bitcoin\u2019s script language for these purposes involved creating transaction outputs that recorded data on the blockchain; for example, to record a digital fingerprint of a file in such a way that anyone could establish proof-of-existence of that file on a specific date by reference to that transaction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The use of bitcoin\u2019s blockchain to store data unrelated to bitcoin payments is a controversial subject. Many developers consider such use abusive and want to discourage it. Others view it as a demonstration of the powerful capabilities of blockchain technology and want to encourage such experimentation. Those who object to the inclusion of nonpayment data argue that it causes \"blockchain bloat,\" burdening those running full Bitcoin nodes with carrying the cost of disk storage for data that the blockchain was not intended to carry. Moreover, such transactions create UTXO that cannot be spent, using the destination Bitcoin address as a freeform 20-byte field. Because the address is used for data, it doesn\u2019t correspond to a private key and the resulting UTXO can never be spent; it\u2019s a fake payment. These transactions that can never be spent are therefore never removed from the UTXO set and cause the size of the UTXO database to forever increase, or \"bloat.\""}
{"prompt": "Keep in mind that there is no \"unlocking script\" that corresponds to RETURN that could possibly be used to \"spend\" a RETURN output. The whole point of RETURN is that you can\u2019t spend the money locked in that output, and therefore it does not need to be held in the UTXO set as potentially spendable\u2014RETURN is provably unspendable. RETURN is usually an output with a zero bitcoin amount, because any bitcoin assigned to such an output is effectively lost forever. If a RETURN is referenced as an input in a transaction, the script validation engine will halt the execution of the validation script and mark the transaction as invalid. The execution of RETURN essentially causes the script to \"RETURN\" with a FALSE and halt. Thus, if you accidentally reference a RETURN output as an input in a transaction, that transaction is invalid.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A standard transaction (one that conforms to the IsStandard() checks) can have only one RETURN output. However, a single RETURN output can be combined in a transaction with outputs of any other type."}
{"prompt": "Timelocks are restrictions on transactions or outputs that only allow spending after a point in time. Bitcoin has had a transaction-level timelock feature from the beginning. It is implemented by the nLocktime field in a transaction. Two new timelock features were introduced in late 2015 and mid-2016 that offer UTXO-level timelocks. These are CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Timelocks are useful for postdating transactions and locking funds to a date in the future. More importantly, timelocks extend bitcoin scripting into the dimension of time, opening the door for complex multistep smart contracts."}

With this transaction Alice and Bob know that:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bob cannot transmit the transaction to redeem the funds until 3 months have elapsed."}

{"prompt": "In December 2015, a new form of timelock was introduced to bitcoin as a soft fork upgrade. Based on a specification in BIP-65, a new script operator called CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY (CLTV) was added to the scripting language. CLTV is a per-output timelock, rather than a per-transaction timelock as is the case with nLocktime. This allows for much greater flexibility in the way timelocks are applied.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In simple terms, by adding the CLTV opcode in the redeem script of an output it restricts the output, so that it can only be spent after the specified time has elapsed."}
{"prompt": "CLTV doesn\u2019t replace nLocktime, but rather restricts specific UTXO such that they can only be spent in a future transaction with nLocktime set to a greater or equal value.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The CLTV opcode takes one parameter as input, expressed as a number in the same format as nLocktime (either a block height or Unix epoch time). As indicated by the VERIFY suffix, CLTV is the type of opcode that halts execution of the script if the outcome is FALSE. If it results in TRUE, execution continues."}
{"prompt": "In order to lock an output with CLTV, you insert it into the redeem script of the output in the transaction that creates the output.

He uses his signature and public key in the unlocking script of that input and sets the transaction nLocktime to be equal to or greater than the timelock in the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY Alice set. Bob then broadcasts the transaction on the Bitcoin network."}
{"prompt": "Bob\u2019s transaction is evaluated as follows. If the CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY parameter Alice set is less than or equal to the spending transaction\u2019s nLocktime, script execution continues (acts as if a \u201cno operation\u201d or NOP opcode was executed).

Critically, when used together, the format of nLocktime must match that of CLTV in the outputs\u2014they must both reference either block height or time in seconds.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " After execution, if CLTV is satisfied, the time parameter that preceded it remains as the top item on the stack and may need to be dropped, with DROP, for correct execution of subsequent script opcodes. You will often see CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY followed by DROP in scripts for this reason."}
{"prompt": "By using nLocktime in conjunction with CLTV, the scenario described in Transaction locktime limitations changes. Alice can no longer spend the money (because it\u2019s locked with Bob\u2019s key) and Bob cannot spend it before the 3-month locktime has expired.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By introducing timelock functionality directly into the scripting language, CLTV allows us to develop some very interesting complex scripts."}
{"prompt": "nLocktime and CLTV are both absolute timelocks in that they specify an absolute point in time. The next two timelock features we will examine are relative timelocks in that they specify, as a condition of spending an output, an elapsed time from the confirmation of the output in the blockchain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Relative timelocks are useful because they allow a chain of two or more interdependent transactions to be held off chain, while imposing a time constraint on one transaction that is dependent on the elapsed time from the confirmation of a previous transaction. In other words, the clock doesn\u2019t start counting until the UTXO is recorded on the blockchain. This functionality is especially useful in bidirectional state channels and Lightning Networks, as we will see in [state_channels]."}
{"prompt": "Relative timelocks, like absolute timelocks, are implemented with both a transaction-level feature and a script-level opcode. The transaction-level relative timelock is implemented as a consensus rule on the value of nSequence, a transaction field that is set in every transaction input. Script-level relative timelocks are implemented with the CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV) opcode.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Relative timelocks are implemented according to the specifications in BIP-68, Relative lock-time using consensus-enforced sequence numbers and BIP-112, CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY."}
{"prompt": "The nSequence field was originally intended (but never properly implemented) to allow modification of transactions in the mempool. In that use, a transaction containing inputs with nSequence value below 232 - 1 (0xFFFFFFFF) indicated a transaction that was not yet \"finalized.\" Such a transaction would be held in the mempool until it was replaced by another transaction spending the same inputs with a higher nSequence value. Once a transaction was received whose inputs had an nSequence value of 0xFFFFFFFF it would be considered \"finalized\" and mined.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The original meaning of nSequence was never properly implemented and the value of nSequence is customarily set to 0xFFFFFFFF in transactions that do not utilize timelocks. For transactions with nLocktime or CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, the nSequence value must be set to less than 231 for the timelock guards to have an effect, as explained below."}
{"prompt": "nSequence as a consensus-enforced relative timelock\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Since the activation of BIP-68, new consensus rules apply for any transaction containing an input whose nSequence value is less than 231 (bit 1<<31 is not set). Programmatically, that means that if the most significant bit (bit 1<<31) is not set, it is a flag that means \"relative locktime.\" Otherwise (bit 1<<31 set), the nSequence value is reserved for other uses such as enabling CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, nLocktime, Opt-In-Replace-By-Fee, and other future developments."}
{"prompt": "Transaction inputs with nSequence values less than 231 are interpreted as having a relative timelock. Such a transaction is only valid once the input has aged by the relative timelock amount. For example, a transaction with one input with an nSequence relative timelock of 30 blocks is only valid when at least 30 blocks have elapsed from the time the UTXO referenced in the input was mined. Since nSequence is a per-input field, a transaction may contain any number of timelocked inputs, all of which must have sufficiently aged for the transaction to be valid. A transaction can include both timelocked inputs (nSequence < 231) and inputs without a relative timelock (nSequence >= 231).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The nSequence value is specified in either blocks or seconds, but in a slightly different format than we saw used in nLocktime. A type-flag is used to differentiate between values counting blocks and values counting time in seconds. The type-flag is set in the 23rd least-significant bit (i.e., value 1<<22). If the type-flag is set, then the nSequence value is interpreted as a multiple of 512 seconds. If the type-flag is not set, the nSequence value is interpreted as a number of blocks."}
{"prompt": "When interpreting nSequence as a relative timelock, only the 16 least significant bits are considered. Once the flags (bits 32 and 23) are evaluated, the nSequence value is usually \"masked\" with a 16-bit mask (e.g., nSequence & 0x0000FFFF).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " BIP-68 definition of nSequence encoding (Source: BIP-68) shows the binary layout of the nSequence value, as defined by BIP-68."}
{"prompt": "Figure 1. BIP-68 definition of nSequence encoding (Source: BIP-68)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Relative timelocks based on consensus enforcement of the nSequence value are defined in BIP-68."}
{"prompt": "Just like CLTV and nLocktime, there is a script opcode for relative timelocks that leverages the nSequence value in scripts. That opcode is CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, commonly referred to as CSV for short.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The CSV opcode when evaluated in an UTXO\u2019s redeem script allows spending only in a transaction whose input nSequence value is greater than or equal to the CSV parameter. Essentially, this restricts spending the UTXO until a certain number of blocks or seconds have elapsed relative to the time the UTXO was mined."}
{"prompt": "As with CLTV, the value in CSV must match the format in the corresponding nSequence value. If CSV is specified in terms of blocks, then so must nSequence. If CSV is specified in terms of seconds, then so must nSequence.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Relative timelocks with CSV are especially useful when several (chained) transactions are created and signed, but not propagated, when they\u2019re kept \"off-chain.\" A child transaction cannot be used until the parent transaction has been propagated, mined, and aged by the time specified in the relative timelock. One application of this use case can be seen in [state_channels] and [lightning_network]."}
{"prompt": "As part of the activation of relative timelocks, there was also a change in the way \"time\" is calculated for timelocks (both absolute and relative). In bitcoin there is a subtle, but very significant, difference between wall time and consensus time. Bitcoin is a decentralized network, which means that each participant has his or her own perspective of time. Events on the network do not occur instantaneously everywhere. Network latency must be factored into the perspective of each node. Eventually everything is synchronized to create a common ledger. Bitcoin reaches consensus every 10 minutes about the state of the ledger as it existed in the past.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The timestamps set in block headers are set by the miners. There is a certain degree of latitude allowed by the consensus rules to account for differences in clock accuracy between decentralized nodes. However, this creates an unfortunate incentive for miners to lie about the time in a block so as to earn extra fees by including timelocked transactions that are not yet mature. See the following section for more information."}
{"prompt": "To remove the incentive to lie and strengthen the security of timelocks, a BIP was proposed and activated at the same time as the BIPs for relative timelocks. This is BIP-113, which defines a new consensus measurement of time called Median-Time-Past.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Median-Time-Past is calculated by taking the timestamps of the last 11 blocks and finding the median. That median time then becomes consensus time and is used for all timelock calculations. By taking the midpoint from approximately two hours in the past, the influence of any one block\u2019s timestamp is reduced. By incorporating 11 blocks, no single miner can influence the timestamps in order to gain fees from transactions with a timelock that hasn\u2019t yet matured."}
{"prompt": "Median-Time-Past changes the implementation of time calculations for nLocktime, CLTV, nSequence, and CSV. The consensus time calculated by Median-Time-Past is always approximately one hour behind wall clock time. If you create timelock transactions, you should account for it when estimating the desired value to encode in nLocktime, nSequence, CLTV, and CSV.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Median-Time-Past is specified in BIP-113."}
{"prompt": "For example, let\u2019s say the highest block in existence is block #100,000. If instead of attempting to mine block #100,001 to extend the chain, some miners attempt to remine #100,000. These miners can choose to include any valid transaction (that hasn\u2019t been mined yet) in their candidate block #100,000. They don\u2019t have to remine the block with the same transactions. In fact, they have the incentive to select the most profitable (highest fee per kB) transactions to include in their block. They can include any transactions that were in the \"old\" block #100,000, as well as any transactions from the current mempool. Essentially they have the option to pull transactions from the \"present\" into the rewritten \"past\" when they re-create block #100,000.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Today, this attack is not very lucrative, because block reward is much higher than total fees per block. But at some point in the future, transaction fees will be the majority of the mining reward (or even the entirety of the mining reward). At that time, this scenario becomes inevitable."}
{"prompt": "To prevent \"fee sniping,\" when Bitcoin Core creates transactions, it uses nLocktime to limit them to the \"next block,\" by default. In our scenario, Bitcoin Core would set nLocktime to 100,001 on any transaction it created. Under normal circumstances, this nLocktime has no effect\u2014the transactions could only be included in block #100,001 anyway; it\u2019s the next block.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " But under a blockchain fork/double-spend attack, the miners would not be able to pull high-fee transactions from the mempool, because all those transactions would be timelocked to block #100,001. They can only remine #100,000 with whatever transactions were valid at that time, essentially gaining no new fees."}
{"prompt": "To achieve this, Bitcoin Core sets the nLocktime on all new transactions to <current block # + 1> and sets the nSequence on all the inputs to 0xFFFFFFFE to enable nLocktime.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Scripts with Flow Control (Conditional Clauses)"}
{"prompt": "One of the more powerful features of Bitcoin Script is flow control, also known as conditional clauses.

Bitcoin conditional clauses look a bit different, but are essentially the same construct.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " At a basic level, bitcoin conditional opcodes allow us to construct a redeem script that has two ways of being unlocked, depending on a TRUE/FALSE outcome of evaluating a logical condition. For example, if x is TRUE, the redeem script is A and the ELSE redeem script is B."}
{"prompt": "Additionally, bitcoin conditional expressions can be \"nested\" indefinitely, meaning that a conditional clause can contain another within it, which contains another, etc. Bitcoin Script flow control can be used to construct very complex scripts with hundreds or even thousands of possible execution paths.

{"prompt": "BIP-173 only encodes witness (P2WPKH and P2WSH) scripts. It is not compatible with non-segwit P2PKH or P2SH scripts. BIP-173 is a checksummed Base32 encoding, as compared to the Base58 encoding of a \"traditional\" Bitcoin address.

{"prompt": "One of the greatest benefits of Segregated Witness is that it eliminates third-party transaction malleability.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Before segwit, transactions could have their signatures subtly modified by third parties, changing their transaction ID (hash) without changing any fundamental properties (inputs, outputs, amounts). This created opportunities for denial-of-service attacks as well as attacks against poorly written wallet software that assumed unconfirmed transaction hashes were immutable."}
{"prompt": "With the introduction of Segregated Witness, transactions have two identifiers, txid and wtxid. The traditional transaction ID txid is the double-SHA256 hash of the serialized transaction, without the witness data. A transaction wtxid is the double-SHA256 hash of the new serialization format of the transaction with witness data.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The traditional txid is calculated in exactly the same way as with a nonsegwit transaction. However, since a pure segwit transaction (a transaction that only contains segwit inputs) has empty scriptSigs in every input, there is no part of the transaction that can be modified by a third party. Therefore, in a pure segwit transaction, the txid is immutable by a third party, even when the transaction is unconfirmed."}
{"prompt": "Segregated Witness transactions have two IDs: txid and wtxid. The txid is the hash of the transaction without the witness data and the wtxid is the hash inclusive of witness data. Only pure segwit transactions (transactions that only contain segwit inputs) have a txid that is not susceptible to third-party transaction malleability.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Segregated Witness' New Signing Algorithm"}
{"prompt": "Segregated Witness modifies the semantics of the four signature verification functions (CHECKSIG, CHECKSIGVERIFY, CHECKMULTISIG, and CHECKMULTISIGVERIFY), changing the way a transaction commitment hash is calculated.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Signatures in bitcoin transactions are applied on a commitment hash, which is calculated from the transaction data, locking specific parts of the data indicating the signer\u2019s commitment to those values. For example, in a simple SIGHASH_ALL type signature, the commitment hash includes all inputs and outputs."}
{"prompt": "Unfortunately, the way the commitment hash was calculated introduced the possibility that a node verifying the signature can be forced to perform a significant number of hash computations. Specifically, the hash operations increase in O(n2) with respect to the number of signature operations in the transaction. An attacker could therefore create a transaction with a very large number of signature operations, causing the entire Bitcoin network to have to perform hundreds or thousands of hash operations to verify the transaction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Segwit represented an opportunity to address this problem by changing the way the commitment hash is calculated. For segwit version 0 witness programs, signature verification occurs using an improved commitment hash algorithm as specified in BIP-143."}
{"prompt": "The new algorithm achieves two important goals. Firstly, the number of hash operations increases by a much more gradual O(n) to the number of signature operations, reducing the opportunity to create denial-of-service attacks with overly complex transactions. Secondly, the commitment hash now also includes the value (amounts) of each input as part of the commitment. This means that a signer can commit to a specific input value without needing to \"fetch\" and check the previous transaction referenced by the input. In the case of offline devices, such as hardware wallets, this greatly simplifies the communication between the host and the hardware wallet, removing the need to stream previous transactions for validation. A hardware wallet can accept the input value \"as stated\" by an untrusted host. Since the signature is invalid if that input value is not correct, the hardware wallet doesn\u2019t need to validate the value before signing the input.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Economic Incentives for Segregated Witness"}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin mining nodes and full nodes incur costs for the resources used to support the Bitcoin network and the blockchain. As the volume of bitcoin transactions increases, so does the cost of resources (CPU, network bandwidth, disk space, memory). Miners are compensated for these costs through fees that are proportional to the size (in bytes) of each transaction. Nonmining full nodes are not compensated, so they incur these costs because they have a need to run an authoritative fully validating full-index node, perhaps because they use the node to operate a bitcoin business.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Without transaction fees, the growth in bitcoin data would arguably increase dramatically. Fees are intended to align the needs of bitcoin users with the burden their transactions impose on the network, through a market-based price discovery mechanism."}
{"prompt": "Nodes that validate transactions keep the UTXO index or the entire UTXO set in memory to speed up validation. Because memory is at least one order of magnitude more expensive than disk, growth of the UTXO set contributes disproportionately to the cost of running a node.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As you can see from the list, not every part of a transaction has an equal impact on the cost of running a node or on the ability of bitcoin to scale to support more transactions. The most expensive part of a transaction are the newly created outputs, as they are added to the in-memory UTXO set. By comparison, signatures (aka witness data) add the least burden to the network and the cost of running a node, because witness data are only validated once and then never used again. Furthermore, immediately after receiving a new transaction and validating witness data, nodes can discard that witness data. If fees are calculated on transaction size, without discriminating between these two types of data, then the market incentives of fees are not aligned with the actual costs imposed by a transaction. In fact, the current fee structure actually encourages the opposite behavior, because witness data is the largest part of a transaction."}
{"prompt": "The incentives created by fees matter because they affect the behavior of wallets. All wallets must implement some strategy for assembling transactions that takes into consideration a number of factors, such as privacy (reducing address reuse), fragmentation (making lots of loose change), and fees. If the fees are overwhelmingly motivating wallets to use as few inputs as possible in transactions, this can lead to UTXO picking and change address strategies that inadvertently bloat the UTXO set.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Transactions consume UTXO in their inputs and create new UTXO with their outputs. A transaction, therefore, that has more inputs than outputs will result in a decrease in the UTXO set, whereas a transaction that has more outputs than inputs will result in an increase in the UTXO set. Let\u2019s consider the difference between inputs and outputs and call that the \u201cNet-new-UTXO.\u201d That\u2019s an important metric, as it tells us what impact a transaction will have on the most expensive network-wide resource, the in-memory UTXO set. A transaction with positive Net-new-UTXO adds to that burden. A transaction with a negative Net-new-UTXO reduces the burden. We would therefore want to encourage transactions that are either negative Net-new-UTXO or neutral with zero Net-new-UTXO."}

Some of those DNS seeds provide a static list of IP addresses of stable bitcoin listening nodes. Some of the DNS seeds are custom implementations of BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Daemon) that return a random subset from a list of Bitcoin node addresses collected by a crawler or a long-running Bitcoin node. The Bitcoin Core client contains the names of nine different DNS seeds. The diversity of ownership and diversity of implementation of the different DNS seeds offers a high level of reliability for the initial bootstrapping process. In the Bitcoin Core client, the option to use the DNS seeds is controlled by the option switch -dnsseed (set to 1 by default, to use the DNS seed).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Alternatively, a bootstrapping node that knows nothing of the network must be given the IP address of at least one Bitcoin node, after which it can establish connections through further introductions.

The initial handshake between peers\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Once one or more connections are established, the new node will send an addr message containing its own IP address to its neighbors. The neighbors will, in turn, forward the addr message to their neighbors, ensuring that the newly connected node becomes well known and better connected. Additionally, the newly connected node can send getaddr to the neighbors, asking them to return a list of IP addresses of other peers. That way, a node can find peers to connect to and advertise its existence on the network for other nodes to find it. Address propagation and discovery shows the address discovery protocol."}

Paths are not persistent\u2014nodes come and go\u2014and so the node must continue to discover new nodes as it loses old connections as well as assist other nodes when they bootstrap. Only one connection is needed to bootstrap, because the first node can offer introductions to its peer nodes and those peers can offer further introductions. It\u2019s also unnecessary and wasteful of network resources to connect to more than a handful of nodes. After bootstrapping, a node will remember its most recent successful peer connections, so that if it is rebooted it can quickly reestablish connections with its former peer network. If none of the former peers respond to its connection request, the node can use the seed nodes to bootstrap again."}
{"prompt": "To override the automatic management of peers and to specify a list of IP addresses, users can provide the option -connect=<IPAddress> and specify one or more IP addresses. If this option is used, the node will only connect to the selected IP addresses, instead of discovering and maintaining the peer connections automatically.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If there is no traffic on a connection, nodes will periodically send a message to maintain the connection.

If you need a lot of disk and it takes two to three days to sync to the network, you are running a full node. That is the price of complete independence and freedom from central authority."}
{"prompt": "The first thing a full node will do once it connects to peers is try to construct a complete blockchain. If it is a brand-new node and has no blockchain at all, it only knows one block, the genesis block, which is statically embedded in the client software. Starting with block #0 (the genesis block), the new node will have to download hundreds of thousands of blocks to synchronize with the network and reestablish the full blockchain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The process of syncing the blockchain starts with the version message, because that contains BestHeight, a node\u2019s current blockchain height (number of blocks). A node will see the version messages from its peers, know how many blocks they each have, and be able to compare to how many blocks it has in its own blockchain. Peered nodes will exchange a getblocks message that contains the hash (fingerprint) of the top block on their local blockchain. One of the peers will be able to identify the received hash as belonging to a block that is not at the top, but rather belongs to an older block, thus deducing that its own local blockchain is longer than its peer\u2019s."}
{"prompt": "The peer that has the longer blockchain has more blocks than the other node and can identify which blocks the other node needs in order to \"catch up.\" It will identify the first 500 blocks to share and transmit their hashes using an inv (inventory) message. The node missing these blocks will then retrieve them, by issuing a series of getdata messages requesting the full block data and identifying the requested blocks using the hashes from the inv message.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Let\u2019s assume, for example, that a node only has the genesis block. It will then receive an inv message from its peers containing the hashes of the next 500 blocks in the chain. It will start requesting blocks from all of its connected peers, spreading the load and ensuring that it doesn\u2019t overwhelm any peer with requests. The node keeps track of how many blocks are \"in transit\" per peer connection, meaning blocks that it has requested but not received, checking that it does not exceed a limit (MAX_BLOCKS_IN_TRANSIT_PER_PEER). This way, if it needs a lot of blocks, it will only request new ones as previous requests are fulfilled, allowing the peers to control the pace of updates and not overwhelm the network. As each block is received, it is added to the blockchain, as we will see in [blockchain]. As the local blockchain is gradually built up, more blocks are requested and received, and the process continues until the node catches up to the rest of the network."}
{"prompt": "This process of comparing the local blockchain with the peers and retrieving any missing blocks happens any time a node goes offline for any period of time. Whether a node has been offline for a few minutes and is missing a few blocks, or a month and is missing a few thousand blocks, it starts by sending getblocks, gets an inv response, and starts downloading the missing blocks.

By comparison, an SPV node is like a tourist in a strange city asking random strangers for turn-by-turn directions while knowing only one main avenue. Although both tourists can verify the existence of a street by visiting it, the tourist without a map doesn\u2019t know what lies down any of the side streets and doesn\u2019t know what other streets exist. Positioned in front of 23 Church Street, the tourist without a map cannot know if there are a dozen other \"23 Church Street\" addresses in the city and whether this is the right one. The mapless tourist\u2019s best chance is to ask enough people and hope some of them are not trying to mug him."}
{"prompt": "SPV verifies transactions by reference to their depth in the blockchain instead of their height. Whereas a full blockchain node will construct a fully verified chain of thousands of blocks and transactions reaching down the blockchain (back in time) all the way to the genesis block, an SPV node will verify the chain of all blocks (but not all transactions) and link that chain to the transaction of interest.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " For example, when examining a transaction in block 300,000, a full node links all 300,000 blocks down to the genesis block and builds a full database of UTXO, establishing the validity of the transaction by confirming that the UTXO remains unspent. An SPV node cannot validate whether the UTXO is unspent. Instead, the SPV node will establish a link between the transaction and the block that contains it, using a merkle path (see [merkle_trees]). Then, the SPV node waits until it sees the six blocks 300,001 through 300,006 piled on top of the block containing the transaction and verifies it by establishing its depth under blocks 300,006 to 300,001. The fact that other nodes on the network accepted block 300,000 and then did the necessary work to produce six more blocks on top of it is proof, by proxy, that the transaction was not a double-spend."}
{"prompt": "An SPV node cannot be persuaded that a transaction exists in a block when the transaction does not in fact exist. The SPV node establishes the existence of a transaction in a block by requesting a merkle path proof and by validating the Proof-of-Work in the chain of blocks. However, a transaction\u2019s existence can be \"hidden\" from an SPV node. An SPV node can definitely prove that a transaction exists but cannot verify that a transaction, such as a double-spend of the same UTXO, doesn\u2019t exist because it doesn\u2019t have a record of all transactions. This vulnerability can be used in a denial-of-service attack or for a double-spending attack against SPV nodes. To defend against this, an SPV node needs to connect randomly to several nodes, to increase the probability that it is in contact with at least one honest node. This need to randomly connect means that SPV nodes also are vulnerable to network partitioning attacks or Sybil attacks, where they are connected to fake nodes or fake networks and do not have access to honest nodes or the real Bitcoin network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " For most practical purposes, well-connected SPV nodes are secure enough, striking a balance between resource needs, practicality, and security.

The process is otherwise the same as that used by a full node to retrieve full blocks. SPV nodes also set a filter on the connection to peers, to filter the stream of future blocks and transactions sent by the peers. Any transactions of interest are retrieved using a getdata request. The peer generates a tx message containing the transactions, in response. SPV node synchronizing the block headers shows the synchronization of block headers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Because SPV nodes need to retrieve specific transactions in order to selectively verify them, they also create a privacy risk. Unlike full blockchain nodes, which collect all transactions within each block, the SPV node\u2019s requests for specific data can inadvertently reveal the addresses in their wallet. For example, a third party monitoring a network could keep track of all the transactions requested by a wallet on an SPV node and use those to associate Bitcoin addresses with the user of that wallet, destroying the user\u2019s privacy."}

{"prompt": "In our previous analogy, a tourist without a map is asking for directions to a specific address, \"23 Church St.\" If she asks strangers for directions to this street, she inadvertently reveals her destination. A bloom filter is like asking, \"Are there any streets in this neighborhood whose name ends in R-C-H?\" A question like that reveals slightly less about the desired destination than asking for \"23 Church St.\" Using this technique, a tourist could specify the desired address in more detail such as \"ending in U-R-C-H\" or less detail as \"ending in H.\" By varying the precision of the search, the tourist reveals more or less information, at the expense of getting more or less specific results. If she asks a less specific pattern, she gets a lot more possible addresses and better privacy, but many of the results are irrelevant. If she asks for a very specific pattern, she gets fewer results but loses privacy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bloom filters serve this function by allowing an SPV node to specify a search pattern for transactions that can be tuned toward precision or privacy.

In essence, as more patterns record on overlapping bits, the bloom filter starts to become saturated with more bits set to 1 and the accuracy of the filter decreases. This is why the filter is a probabilistic data structure\u2014it gets less accurate as more patterns are added. The accuracy depends on the number of patterns added versus the size of the bit array (N) and number of hash functions (M).

In light of the newly added transaction, which is no longer an orphan, the process is repeated recursively looking for any further descendants, until no more descendants are found. Through this process, the arrival of a parent transaction triggers a cascade reconstruction of an entire chain of interdependent transactions by re-uniting the orphans with their parents all the way down the chain."}

Unlike the transaction and orphan pools, the UTXO pool is not initialized empty but instead contains millions of entries of unspent transaction outputs, everything that is unspent from all the way back to the genesis block. The UTXO pool may be housed in local memory or as an indexed database table on persistent storage."}
{"prompt": "Each block within the blockchain is identified by a hash, generated using the SHA256 cryptographic hash algorithm on the header of the block. Each block also references a previous block, known as the parent block, through the \"previous block hash\" field in the block header. In other words, each block contains the hash of its parent inside its own header. The sequence of hashes linking each block to its parent creates a chain going back all the way to the first block ever created, known as the genesis block.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Although a block has just one parent, it can temporarily have multiple children. Each of the children refers to the same block as its parent and contains the same (parent) hash in the \"previous block hash\" field. Multiple children arise during a blockchain \"fork,\" a temporary situation that occurs when different blocks are discovered almost simultaneously by different miners (see [forks]). Eventually, only one child block becomes part of the blockchain and the \"fork\" is resolved. Even though a block may have more than one child, each block can have only one parent. This is because a block has one single \"previous block hash\" field referencing its single parent."}
{"prompt": "The \"previous block hash\" field is inside the block header and thereby affects the current block\u2019s hash. The child\u2019s own identity changes if the parent\u2019s identity changes. When the parent is modified in any way, the parent\u2019s hash changes. The parent\u2019s changed hash necessitates a change in the \"previous block hash\" pointer of the child. This in turn causes the child\u2019s hash to change, which requires a change in the pointer of the grandchild, which in turn changes the grandchild, and so on. This cascade effect ensures that once a block has many generations following it, it cannot be changed without forcing a recalculation of all subsequent blocks. Because such a recalculation would require enormous computation (and therefore energy consumption), the existence of a long chain of blocks makes the blockchain\u2019s deep history immutable, which is a key feature of bitcoin\u2019s security.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One way to think about the blockchain is like layers in a geological formation, or glacier core sample. The surface layers might change with the seasons, or even be blown away before they have time to settle. But once you go a few inches deep, geological layers become more and more stable. By the time you look a few hundred feet down, you are looking at a snapshot of the past that has remained undisturbed for millions of years. In the blockchain, the most recent few blocks might be revised if there is a chain recalculation due to a fork. The top six blocks are like a few inches of topsoil. But once you go more deeply into the blockchain, beyond six blocks, blocks are less and less likely to change. After 100 blocks back, there is so much stability that the coinbase transaction\u2014the transaction containing newly mined bitcoin\u2014can be spent. A few thousand blocks back (a month) and the blockchain is settled history, for all practical purposes. While the protocol always allows a chain to be undone by a longer chain and while the possibility of any block being reversed always exists, the probability of such an event decreases as time passes until it becomes infinitesimal."}

{"prompt": "The purpose of mining is not the creation of new bitcoin. That\u2019s the incentive system. Mining is the mechanism by which bitcoin\u2019s security is decentralized.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Miners validate new transactions and record them on the global ledger. A new block, containing transactions that occurred since the last block, is \"mined\" every 10 minutes on average, thereby adding those transactions to the blockchain. Transactions that become part of a block and added to the blockchain are considered \"confirmed,\" which allows the new owners of bitcoin to spend the bitcoin they received in those transactions."}
{"prompt": "Miners receive two types of rewards in return for the security provided by mining: new coins created with each new block, also known as a block reward or coinbase reward, and transaction fees from all the transactions included in the block. To earn this reward, miners compete to solve a difficult mathematical problem based on a cryptographic hash algorithm. The solution to the problem, called the Proof-of-Work, is included in the new block and acts as proof that the miner expended significant computing effort. The competition to solve the Proof-of-Work algorithm to earn the reward and the right to record transactions on the blockchain is the basis for bitcoin\u2019s security model.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The process is called mining because the reward (new coin generation) is designed to simulate diminishing returns, just like mining for precious metals. Bitcoin\u2019s money supply is created through mining, similar to how a central bank issues new money by printing bank notes. The maximum amount of newly created bitcoin a miner can add to a block decreases approximately every four years (or precisely every 210,000 blocks). It started at 50 bitcoin per block in January of 2009 and halved to 25 bitcoin per block in November of 2012. It halved to 12.5 bitcoin in July 2016 and again to 6.25 bitcoin in May 2020. Based on this formula, bitcoin mining rewards decrease exponentially until approximately the year 2140, when all bitcoin (20.99999998 million) will have been issued. After 2140, no new bitcoin will be issued."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin miners also earn fees from transactions. Every transaction usually includes a transaction fee, in the form of a surplus of bitcoin between the transaction\u2019s inputs and outputs. The winning bitcoin miner gets to \"keep the change\" on the transactions included in the winning block. Today, the fees represent 0.5% or less of a bitcoin miner\u2019s income, the vast majority coming from the newly minted bitcoin. However, as the block reward decreases over time and the number of transactions per block increases, a greater proportion of bitcoin mining earnings will come from fees. Gradually, the mining reward will be dominated by transaction fees, which will form the primary incentive for miners. After 2140, the amount of new bitcoin in each block drops to zero and bitcoin mining will be incentivized only by transaction fees.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In this chapter, we will first examine mining as a monetary supply mechanism and then look at the most important function of mining: the decentralized consensus mechanism that underpins bitcoin\u2019s security."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin are \"minted\" during the creation of each block at a fixed and diminishing rate. Each block, generated on average every 10 minutes, contains entirely new bitcoin, created from nothing. Every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years, the currency issuance rate is decreased by 50%. For the first four years of operation of the network, each block contained 50 new bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In November 2012, the new bitcoin issuance rate was decreased to 25 bitcoin per block. In July of 2016 it was decreased to 12.5 bitcoin per block, and in May of 2020 it was decreased again to 6.25 bitcoin per block. The rate of new coins decreases like this exponentially over 32 \"halvings\" until block 6,720,000 (mined approximately in year 2137), when it reaches the minimum currency unit of 1 satoshi. Finally, after 6.93 million blocks, in approximately 2140, almost 2,099,999,997,690,000 satoshis, or almost 21 million bitcoin, will be issued. Thereafter, blocks will contain no new bitcoin, and miners will be rewarded solely through the transaction fees. Supply of bitcoin currency over time based on a geometrically decreasing issuance rate shows the total bitcoin in circulation over time, as the issuance of currency decreases."}
{"prompt": "The maximum number of coins mined is the upper limit of possible mining rewards for bitcoin. In practice, a miner may intentionally mine a block taking less than the full reward. Such blocks have already been mined and more may be mined in the future, resulting in a lower total issuance of the currency.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the example code in A script for calculating how much total bitcoin will be issued, we calculate the total amount of bitcoin that will be issued."}

{"prompt": "The most important and debated consequence of fixed and diminishing monetary issuance is that the currency tends to be inherently deflationary. Deflation is the phenomenon of appreciation of value due to a mismatch in supply and demand that drives up the value (and exchange rate) of a currency. The opposite of inflation, price deflation, means that the money has more purchasing power over time.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Many economists argue that a deflationary economy is a disaster that should be avoided at all costs. That is because in a period of rapid deflation, people tend to hoard money instead of spending it, hoping that prices will fall. Such a phenomenon unfolded during Japan\u2019s \"Lost Decade,\" when a complete collapse of demand pushed the currency into a deflationary spiral."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin experts argue that deflation is not bad per se. Rather, deflation is associated with a collapse in demand because that is the only example of deflation we have to study. In a fiat currency with the possibility of unlimited printing, it is very difficult to enter a deflationary spiral unless there is a complete collapse in demand and an unwillingness to print money. Deflation in bitcoin is not caused by a collapse in demand, but by a predictably constrained supply.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The positive aspect of deflation, of course, is that it is the opposite of inflation. Inflation causes a slow but inevitable debasement of currency, resulting in a form of hidden taxation that punishes savers in order to bail out debtors (including the biggest debtors, governments themselves). Currencies under government control suffer from the moral hazard of easy debt issuance that can later be erased through debasement at the expense of savers."}
{"prompt": "In the previous chapter we looked at the blockchain, the global public ledger (list) of all transactions, which everyone in the Bitcoin network accepts as the authoritative record of ownership.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " But how can everyone in the network agree on a single universal \"truth\" about who owns what, without having to trust anyone? All traditional payment systems depend on a trust model that has a central authority providing a clearinghouse service, basically verifying and clearing all transactions. Bitcoin has no central authority, yet somehow every full node has a complete copy of a public ledger that it can trust as the authoritative record. The blockchain is not created by a central authority, but is assembled independently by every node in the network. Somehow, every node in the network, acting on information transmitted across insecure network connections, can arrive at the same conclusion and assemble a copy of the same public ledger as everyone else. This chapter examines the process by which the Bitcoin network achieves global consensus without central authority."}

Emergent, because consensus is not achieved explicitly\u2014there is no election or fixed moment when consensus occurs.

The hash function\u2019s result cannot be determined in advance, nor can a pattern be created that will produce a specific hash value. This feature of hash functions means that the only way to produce a hash result matching a specific target is to try again and again, randomly modifying the input until the desired hash result appears by chance."}

{"prompt": "To make a challenge out of this algorithm, let\u2019s set a target: find a phrase that produces a hexadecimal hash that starts with a zero. Fortunately, this isn\u2019t difficult! SHA256 output of a script for generating many hashes by iterating on a nonce shows that the phrase \"I am Satoshi Nakamoto13\" produces the hash 0ebc56d59a34f5082aaef3d66b37a661696c2b618e62432727216ba9531041a5, which fits our criteria. It took 13 attempts to find it. In terms of probabilities, if the output of the hash function is evenly distributed we would expect to find a result with a 0 as the hexadecimal prefix once every 16 hashes (one out of 16 hexadecimal digits 0 through F). In numerical terms, that means finding a hash value that is less than 0x1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000. We call this threshold the target and the goal is to find a hash that is numerically equal to or less than the target. If we decrease the target, the task of finding a hash that is less than the target becomes more and more difficult.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To give a simple analogy, imagine a game where players throw a pair of dice repeatedly, trying to throw equal to or less than a specified target. In the first round, the target is 11. Unless you throw double-six, you win. In the next round the target is 10. Players must throw 10 or less to win, again an easy task. Let\u2019s say a few rounds later the target is down to 5. Now, more than half the dice throws will exceed the target and therefore be invalid. It takes exponentially more dice throws to win, the lower the target gets. Eventually, when the target is 2 (the minimum possible), only one throw out of every 36, or 2% of them, will produce a winning result."}

Therefore, an outcome of specified difficulty constitutes proof of a specific amount of work.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In SHA256 output of a script for generating many hashes by iterating on a nonce, the winning \"nonce\" is 13 and this result can be confirmed by anyone independently. Anyone can add the number 13 as a suffix to the phrase \"I am Satoshi Nakamoto\" and compute the hash, verifying that it is less than the target. The successful result is also Proof-of-Work, because it proves we did the work to find that nonce. While it only takes one hash computation to verify, it took us 13 hash computations to find a nonce that worked. If we had a lower target (higher difficulty) it would take many more hash computations to find a suitable nonce, but only one hash computation for anyone to verify. Furthermore, by knowing the target, anyone can estimate the difficulty using statistics and therefore know how much work was needed to find such a nonce."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work is very similar to the challenge shown in SHA256 output of a script for generating many hashes by iterating on a nonce. The miner constructs a candidate block filled with transactions. Next, the miner calculates the hash of this block\u2019s header and sees if it is equal to or smaller than the current target. If the hash is greater than the target, the miner will modify the nonce (usually just incrementing it by one) and try again. At the current difficulty in the Bitcoin network, miners have to try quadrillions of times before finding a nonce that results in a low enough block header hash.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A very simplified Proof-of-Work algorithm is implemented in Python in Simplified Proof-of-Work implementation."}

This is bitcoin\u2019s heartbeat and underpins the frequency of currency issuance and the speed of transaction settlement. It has to remain constant not just over the short term, but over a period of many decades. Over this time, it is expected that computer power will continue to increase at a rapid pace. Furthermore, the number of participants in mining and the computers they use will also constantly change. To keep the block generation time at 10 minutes, the difficulty of mining must be adjusted to account for these changes.

{"prompt": "Note that the target is independent of the number of transactions or the value of transactions. This means that the amount of hashing power and therefore electricity expended to secure bitcoin is also entirely independent of the number of transactions. Bitcoin can scale up, achieve broader adoption, and remain secure without any increase in hashing power from today\u2019s level. The increase in hashing power represents market forces as new miners enter the market to compete for the reward. As long as enough hashing power is under the control of miners acting honestly in pursuit of the reward, it is enough to prevent \"takeover\" attacks and, therefore, it is enough to secure bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The difficulty of mining is closely related to the cost of electricity and the exchange rate of bitcoin vis-a-vis the currency used to pay for electricity. High-performance mining systems are about as efficient as possible with the current generation of silicon fabrication, converting electricity into hashing computation at the highest rate possible. The primary influence on the mining market is the price of one kilowatt-hour of electricity in bitcoin, because that determines the profitability of mining and therefore the incentives to enter or exit the mining market."}

In previous sections we saw how miners get to write a transaction that awards them the new bitcoin created within the block and claim the transaction fees. Why don\u2019t miners write themselves a transaction for a thousand bitcoin instead of the correct reward? Because every node validates blocks according to the same rules. An invalid coinbase transaction would make the entire block invalid, which would result in the block being rejected and, therefore, that transaction would never become part of the ledger. The miners have to construct a perfect block, based on the shared rules that all nodes follow, and mine it with a correct solution to the Proof-of-Work. To do so, they expend a lot of electricity in mining, and if they cheat, all the electricity and effort is wasted. This is why independent validation is a key component of decentralized consensus.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Assembling and Selecting Chains of Blocks"}
{"prompt": "The final step in bitcoin\u2019s decentralized consensus mechanism is the assembly of blocks into chains and the selection of the chain with the most Proof-of-Work. Once a node has validated a new block, it will then attempt to assemble a chain by connecting the block to the existing blockchain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nodes maintain three sets of blocks: those connected to the main blockchain, those that form branches off the main blockchain (secondary chains), and finally, blocks that do not have a known parent in the known chains (orphans).

{"prompt": "The \"main chain\" at any time is whichever valid chain of blocks has the most cumulative Proof-of-Work associated with it. Under most circumstances this is also the chain with the most blocks in it, unless there are two equal-length chains and one has more Proof-of-Work. The main chain will also have branches with blocks that are \"siblings\" to the blocks on the main chain. These blocks are valid but not part of the main chain. They are kept for future reference, in case one of those chains is extended to exceed the main chain in work. In the next section (Blockchain Forks), we will see how secondary chains occur as a result of an almost simultaneous mining of blocks at the same height.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When a new block is received, a node will try to slot it into the existing blockchain. The node will look at the block\u2019s \"previous block hash\" field, which is the reference to the block\u2019s parent. Then, the node will attempt to find that parent in the existing blockchain. Most of the time, the parent will be the \"tip\" of the main chain, meaning this new block extends the main chain. For example, the new block 277,316 has a reference to the hash of its parent block 277,315. Most nodes that receive 277,316 will already have block 277,315 as the tip of their main chain and will therefore link the new block and extend that chain."}
{"prompt": "Sometimes, as we will see in Blockchain Forks, the new block extends a chain that is not the main chain. In that case, the node will attach the new block to the secondary chain it extends and then compare the work of the secondary chain to the main chain. If the secondary chain has more cumulative work than the main chain, the node will reconverge on the secondary chain, meaning it will select the secondary chain as its new main chain, making the old main chain a secondary chain. If the node is a miner, it will now construct a block extending this new, longer, chain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If a valid block is received and no parent is found in the existing chains, that block is considered an \"orphan.\" Orphan blocks are saved in the orphan block pool where they will stay until their parent is received. Once the parent is received and linked into the existing chains, the orphan can be pulled out of the orphan pool and linked to the parent, making it part of a chain. Orphan blocks usually occur when two blocks that were mined within a short time of each other are received in reverse order (child before parent)."}
{"prompt": "By selecting the greatest-cumulative-work valid chain, all nodes eventually achieve network-wide consensus. Temporary discrepancies between chains are resolved eventually as more work is added, extending one of the possible chains. Mining nodes \"vote\" with their mining power by choosing which chain to extend by mining the next block. When they mine a new block and extend the chain, the new block itself represents their vote.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the next section we will look at how discrepancies between competing chains (forks) are resolved by the independent selection of the greatest-cumulative-work chain."}

{"prompt": "A \"fork\" occurs whenever there are two different valid blocks at the same block height competing to form the longest blockchain.

Each node that receives a valid block will incorporate it into its blockchain, extending the blockchain by one block. If that node later sees another valid block extending the same parent (at the same block height), it connects the second block on a secondary chain, forking its main chain.

Since it was received second, it is assumed to have \"lost\" the race. Yet, the \"upside-down triangle\" block is not discarded. It is linked to the \"star\" block parent and forms a secondary chain.

Bitcoin\u2019s mining difficulty metric (chart on a logarithmic scale)"}
{"prompt": "In this highly competitive environment, individual miners working alone (also known as solo miners) don\u2019t stand a chance. The likelihood of them finding a block to offset their electricity and hardware costs is so low that it represents a gamble, like playing the lottery. Even the fastest consumer ASIC mining system cannot keep up with commercial systems that stack tens of thousands of these chips in giant warehouses near hydroelectric powerstations. Miners now collaborate to form mining pools, pooling their hashing power and sharing the reward among thousands of participants. By participating in a pool, miners get a smaller share of the overall reward, but typically get rewarded every day, reducing uncertainty.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Let\u2019s look at a specific example. Assume a miner has purchased mining hardware with a combined hashing rate of 14,000 gigahashes per second (GH/s), or 14 TH/s. In 2017 this equipment costs approximately $2,500 USD. The hardware consumes 1375 watts (1.3 kW) of electricity when running, 33 kW-hours a day, at a cost of $1 to $2 per day at very low electricity rates. At current bitcoin difficulty, the miner will be able to solo mine a block approximately once every 4 years. How do we work out that probability? It is based on a network-wide hashing rate of 3 EH/sec (in 2017), and the miner\u2019s rate of 14 TH/sec:"}

{"prompt": "If the miner does find a single block in that timeframe, the payout of 6.25 bitcoin, at approximately $1,000 per bitcoin, will result in a single payout of $6,250, which will produce a net profit of about $750. However, the chance of finding a block in a 4-year period depends on the miner\u2019s luck. He might find two blocks in 4 years and make a larger profit. Or he might not find a block for 5 years and suffer a big financial loss. Even worse, the difficulty of the bitcoin Proof-of-Work algorithm is likely to go up significantly over that period, at the current rate of growth of hashing power, meaning the miner has, at most, one year to break even before the hardware is effectively obsolete and must be replaced by more powerful mining hardware. Financially this only makes sense at very low electricity cost (less than 1 cent per kW-hour) and only at very large scale.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mining pools coordinate many hundreds or thousands of miners, over specialized pool-mining protocols. The individual miners configure their mining equipment to connect to a pool server, and specify a Bitcoin address, which will receive their share of the rewards. Their mining hardware remains connected to the pool server while mining, synchronizing their efforts with the other miners. Thus, the pool miners share the effort to mine a block and then share in the rewards."}
{"prompt": "Successful blocks pay the reward to a pool Bitcoin address, rather than individual miners. The pool server will periodically make payments to the miners' Bitcoin addresses, once their share of the rewards has reached a certain threshold. Typically, the pool server charges a percentage fee of the rewards for providing the pool-mining service.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Miners participating in a pool split the work of searching for a solution to a candidate block, earning \"shares\" for their mining contribution. The mining pool sets a higher target (lower difficulty) for earning a share, typically more than 1,000 times easier than the Bitcoin network\u2019s target. When someone in the pool successfully mines a block, the reward is earned by the pool and then shared with all miners in proportion to the number of shares they contributed to the effort."}
{"prompt": "Pools are open to any miner, big or small, professional or amateur. A pool will therefore have some participants with a single small mining machine, and others with a garage full of high-end mining hardware. Some will be mining with a few tens of a kilowatt of electricity, others will be running a data center consuming a megawatt of power. How does a mining pool measure the individual contributions, so as to fairly distribute the rewards, without the possibility of cheating? The answer is to use bitcoin\u2019s Proof-of-Work algorithm to measure each pool miner\u2019s contribution, but set at a lower difficulty so that even the smallest pool miners win a share frequently enough to make it worthwhile to contribute to the pool. By setting a lower difficulty for earning shares, the pool measures the amount of work done by each miner. Each time a pool miner finds a block header hash that is equal to or less than the pool target, she proves she has done the hashing work to find that result. More importantly, the work to find shares contributes, in a statistically measurable way, to the overall effort to find a hash equal to or lower than the Bitcoin network\u2019s target. Thousands of miners trying to find low-value hashes will eventually find one low enough to satisfy the Bitcoin network target.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Let\u2019s return to the analogy of a dice game. If the dice players are throwing dice with a goal of throwing equal to or less than four (the overall network difficulty), a pool would set an easier target, counting how many times the pool players managed to throw equal to or less than eight. When pool players throw equal to or less than eight (the pool share target) but higher than four (higher than the overall network difficulty), they earn shares, but neither they nor the pool win the game because they don\u2019t achieve the game target (equal to or less than four). The pool players will achieve the easier pool target much more often, earning them shares very regularly, even when they don\u2019t achieve the harder target of winning the game. Every now and then, one of the pool players will throw a combined dice throw of equal to or less than four, the pool player wins a share and the whole pool wins the game. Then, the earnings can be distributed to the pool players based on the amount of shares each one has earned. Even though the target of eight-or-less wasn\u2019t winning, it was a fair way to measure dice throws for the players, and it occasionally produces a four-or-less throw."}
{"prompt": "Most mining pools are \"managed,\" meaning that there is a company or individual running a pool server. The owner of the pool server is called the pool operator, and he charges pool miners a percentage fee of the earnings.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The pool server runs specialized software and a pool-mining protocol that coordinate the activities of the pool miners. The pool server is also connected to one or more full Bitcoin nodes and has direct access to a full copy of the blockchain database. This allows the pool server to validate blocks and transactions on behalf of the pool miners, relieving them of the burden of running a full node. For pool miners, this is an important consideration, because a full node requires a dedicated computer with at least 300 to 350 GB of persistent storage (disk) and at least 2 to 4 GB of memory (RAM). Furthermore, the bitcoin software running on the full node needs to be monitored, maintained, and upgraded frequently. Any downtime caused by a lack of maintenance or lack of resources will hurt the miner\u2019s profitability. For many miners, the ability to mine without running a full node is another big benefit of joining a managed pool."}
{"prompt": "Managed pools create the possibility of cheating by the pool operator, who might direct the pool effort to double-spend transactions or invalidate blocks (see Consensus Attacks). Furthermore, centralized pool servers represent a single-point-of-failure. If the pool server is down or is slowed by a denial-of-service attack, the pool miners cannot mine. In 2011, to resolve these issues of centralization, a new pool mining method was proposed and implemented: P2Pool, a peer-to-peer mining pool without a central operator.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " P2Pool works by decentralizing the functions of the pool server, implementing a parallel blockchain-like system called a share chain. A share chain is a blockchain running at a lower difficulty than the Bitcoin blockchain. The share chain allows pool miners to collaborate in a decentralized pool by mining shares on the share chain at a rate of one share block every 30 seconds. Each of the blocks on the share chain records a proportionate share reward for the pool miners who contribute work, carrying the shares forward from the previous share block. When one of the share blocks also achieves the Bitcoin network target, it is propagated and included on the Bitcoin blockchain, rewarding all the pool miners who contributed to all the shares that preceded the winning share block. Essentially, instead of a pool server keeping track of pool miner shares and rewards, the share chain allows all pool miners to keep track of all shares using a decentralized consensus mechanism like bitcoin\u2019s blockchain consensus mechanism."}
{"prompt": "P2Pool mining is more complex than pool mining because it requires that the pool miners run a dedicated computer with enough disk space, memory, and internet bandwidth to support a full Bitcoin node and the P2Pool node software. P2Pool miners connect their mining hardware to their local P2Pool node, which simulates the functions of a pool server by sending block templates to the mining hardware. On P2Pool, individual pool miners construct their own candidate blocks, aggregating transactions much like solo miners, but then mine collaboratively on the share chain. P2Pool is a hybrid approach that has the advantage of much more granular payouts than solo mining, but without giving too much control to a pool operator like managed pools.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Even though P2Pool reduces the concentration of power by mining pool operators, it is conceivably vulnerable to 51% attacks against the share chain itself. A much broader adoption of P2Pool does not solve the 51% attack problem for bitcoin itself. Rather, P2Pool makes bitcoin more robust overall, as part of a diversified mining ecosystem."}
{"prompt": "It is important to note that consensus attacks can only affect future consensus, or at best, the most recent past (tens of blocks). Bitcoin\u2019s ledger becomes more and more immutable as time passes. While in theory, a fork can be achieved at any depth, in practice, the computing power needed to force a very deep fork is immense, making old blocks practically immutable. Consensus attacks also do not affect the security of the private keys and signing algorithm (ECDSA). A consensus attack cannot steal bitcoin, spend bitcoin without signatures, redirect bitcoin, or otherwise change past transactions or ownership records. Consensus attacks can only affect the most recent blocks and cause denial-of-service disruptions on the creation of future blocks.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One attack scenario against the consensus mechanism is called the \"51% attack.\" In this scenario a group of miners, controlling a majority (51%) of the total network\u2019s hashing power, collude to attack bitcoin. With the ability to mine the majority of the blocks, the attacking miners can cause deliberate \"forks\" in the blockchain and double-spend transactions or execute denial-of-service attacks against specific transactions or addresses. A fork/double-spend attack is where the attacker causes previously confirmed blocks to be invalidated by forking below them and re-converging on an alternate chain. With sufficient power, an attacker can invalidate six or more blocks in a row, causing transactions that were considered immutable (six confirmations) to be invalidated. Note that a double-spend can only be done on the attacker\u2019s own transactions, for which the attacker can produce a valid signature. Double-spending one\u2019s own transactions is profitable if by invalidating a transaction the attacker can get an irreversible exchange payment or product without paying for it."}
{"prompt": "Let\u2019s examine a practical example of a 51% attack. In the first chapter, we looked at a transaction between Alice and Bob for a cup of coffee. Bob, the cafe owner, is willing to accept payment for cups of coffee without waiting for confirmation (mining in a block), because the risk of a double-spend on a cup of coffee is low in comparison to the convenience of rapid customer service. This is similar to the practice of coffee shops that accept credit card payments without a signature for amounts below $25, because the risk of a credit-card chargeback is low while the cost of delaying the transaction to obtain a signature is comparatively larger. In contrast, selling a more expensive item for bitcoin runs the risk of a double-spend attack, where the buyer broadcasts a competing transaction that spends the same inputs (UTXO) and cancels the payment to the merchant. A double-spend attack can happen in two ways: either before a transaction is confirmed, or if the attacker takes advantage of a blockchain fork to undo several blocks. A 51% attack allows attackers to double-spend their own transactions in the new chain, thus undoing the corresponding transaction in the old chain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In our example, malicious attacker Mallory goes to Carol\u2019s gallery and purchases a beautiful triptych painting depicting Satoshi Nakamoto as Prometheus. Carol sells \"The Great Fire\" paintings for $250,000 in bitcoin to Mallory. Instead of waiting for six or more confirmations on the transaction, Carol wraps and hands the paintings to Mallory after only one confirmation. Mallory works with an accomplice, Paul, who operates a large mining pool, and the accomplice launches a 51% attack as soon as Mallory\u2019s transaction is included in a block. Paul directs the mining pool to remine the same block height as the block containing Mallory\u2019s transaction, replacing Mallory\u2019s payment to Carol with a transaction that double-spends the same input as Mallory\u2019s payment. The double-spend transaction consumes the same UTXO and pays it back to Mallory\u2019s wallet, instead of paying it to Carol, essentially allowing Mallory to keep the bitcoin. Paul then directs the mining pool to mine an additional block, so as to make the chain containing the double-spend transaction longer than the original chain (causing a fork below the block containing Mallory\u2019s transaction). When the blockchain fork resolves in favor of the new (longer) chain, the double-spent transaction replaces the original payment to Carol. Carol is now missing the three paintings and also has no bitcoin payment. Throughout all this activity, Paul\u2019s mining pool participants might remain blissfully unaware of the double-spend attempt, because they mine with automated miners and cannot monitor every transaction or block."}
{"prompt": "To protect against this kind of attack, a merchant selling large-value items must wait at least six confirmations before giving the product to the buyer. Alternatively, the merchant should use an escrow multisignature account, again waiting for several confirmations after the escrow account is funded. The more confirmations elapse, the harder it becomes to invalidate a transaction with a 51% attack. For high-value items, payment by bitcoin will still be convenient and efficient even if the buyer has to wait 24 hours for delivery, which would correspond to approximately 144 confirmations.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In addition to a double-spend attack, the other scenario for a consensus attack is to deny service to specific bitcoin participants (specific Bitcoin addresses). An attacker with a majority of the mining power can simply ignore specific transactions. If they are included in a block mined by another miner, the attacker can deliberately fork and remine that block, again excluding the specific transactions. This type of attack can result in a sustained denial-of-service against a specific address or set of addresses for as long as the attacker controls the majority of the mining power."}
{"prompt": "Despite its name, the 51% attack scenario doesn\u2019t actually require 51% of the hashing power. In fact, such an attack can be attempted with a smaller percentage of the hashing power. The 51% threshold is simply the level at which such an attack is almost guaranteed to succeed. A consensus attack is essentially a tug-of-war for the next block and the \"stronger\" group is more likely to win. With less hashing power, the probability of success is reduced, because other miners control the generation of some blocks with their \"honest\" mining power. One way to look at it is that the more hashing power an attacker has, the longer the fork he can deliberately create, the more blocks in the recent past he can invalidate, or the more blocks in the future he can control. Security research groups have used statistical modeling to claim that various types of consensus attacks are possible with as little as 30% of the hashing power.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The massive increase of total hashing power has arguably made bitcoin impervious to attacks by a single miner. There is no possible way for a solo miner to control more than a small percentage of the total mining power. However, the centralization of control caused by mining pools has introduced the risk of for-profit attacks by a mining pool operator. The pool operator in a managed pool controls the construction of candidate blocks and also controls which transactions are included. This gives the pool operator the power to exclude transactions or introduce double-spend transactions. If such abuse of power is done in a limited and subtle way, a pool operator could conceivably profit from a consensus attack without being noticed."}
{"prompt": "Not all attackers will be motivated by profit, however. One potential attack scenario is where an attacker intends to disrupt the Bitcoin network without the possibility of profiting from such disruption. A malicious attack aimed at crippling bitcoin would require enormous investment and covert planning, but could conceivably be launched by a well-funded, most likely state-sponsored, attacker. Alternatively, a well-funded attacker could attack bitcoin\u2019s consensus by simultaneously amassing mining hardware, compromising pool operators, and attacking other pools with denial-of-service. All of these scenarios are theoretically possible, but increasingly impractical as the Bitcoin network\u2019s overall hashing power continues to grow exponentially.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Undoubtedly, a serious consensus attack would erode confidence in bitcoin in the short term, possibly causing a significant price decline. However, the Bitcoin network and software are constantly evolving, so consensus attacks would be met with immediate countermeasures by the bitcoin community, making bitcoin more robust."}
{"prompt": "In Blockchain Forks we looked at how the Bitcoin network may briefly diverge, with two parts of the network following two different branches of the blockchain for a short time. We saw how this process occurs naturally, as part of the normal operation of the network and how the network reconverges on a common blockchain after one or more blocks are mined.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There is another scenario in which the network may diverge into following two chains: a change in the consensus rules. This type of fork is called a hard fork, because after the fork the network does not reconverge onto a single chain. Instead, the two chains evolve independently. Hard forks occur when part of the network is operating under a different set of consensus rules than the rest of the network. This may occur because of a bug or because of a deliberate change in the implementation of the consensus rules."}
{"prompt": "Hard forks can be used to change the rules of consensus, but they require coordination between all participants in the system. Any nodes that do not upgrade to the new consensus rules are unable to participate in the consensus mechanism and are forced onto a separate chain at the moment of the hard fork. Thus, a change introduced by a hard fork can be thought of as not \"forward compatible,\" in that non-upgraded systems can\u2019t process the new consensus rules after the hard fork event.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Let\u2019s examine the mechanics of a hard fork with a specific example."}
{"prompt": "Later, however, at block height 6, a hard fork occurs. Let\u2019s assume that a new implementation of the client is released with a change in the consensus rules. Starting on block height 7, miners running this new implementation will accept a new type of digital signature, let\u2019s call it a \"Smores\" signature, that is not ECDSA based. Immediately after, a node running the new implementation creates a transaction that contains a Smores signature and a miner with the updated software mines block 7b containing this transaction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Any node or miner that has not upgraded the software to validate Smores signatures is now unable to process block 7b. From their perspective, both the transaction that contained a Smores signature and block 7b that contained that transaction are invalid, because they are evaluating them based upon the old consensus rules. These nodes will reject the transaction and the block and will not propagate them. Any miners that are using the old rules will not accept block 7b and will continue to mine a candidate block whose parent is block 6. In fact, miners using the old rules may not even receive block 7b if all the nodes they are connected to are also obeying the old rules and therefore not propagating the block. Eventually, they will be able to mine block 7a, which is valid under the old rules and does not contain any transactions with Smores signatures."}
{"prompt": "The two chains continue to diverge from this point. Miners on the \"b\" chain will continue to accept and mine transactions containing Smores signatures, while miners on the \"a\" chain will continue to ignore these transactions. Even if block 8b does not contain any Smores-signed transactions, the miners on the \"a\" chain cannot process it. To them it appears to be an orphan block, as its parent \"7b\" is not recognized as a valid block.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hard Forks: Software, Network, Mining, and Chain"}
{"prompt": "For software developers, the term \"fork\" has another meaning, adding confusion to the term \"hard fork.\" In open source software, a fork occurs when a group of developers choose to follow a different software roadmap and start a competing implementation of an open source project. We\u2019ve already discussed two circumstances that will lead to a hard fork in bitcoin: a bug in the consensus rules and a deliberate modification of the consensus rules. In the case of a deliberate change to the consensus rules, a software fork precedes the hard fork. However, for this type of hard fork to occur, a new software implementation of the consensus rules must be developed, adopted, and launched.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Examples of software forks that have attempted to change consensus rules include Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, and most recently Bitcoin Unlimited. However, none of these software forks have resulted in a hard fork. While a software fork is a necessary precondition, it is not in itself sufficient for a hard fork to occur. For a hard fork to occur, the competing implementation must be adopted and the new rules activated, by miners, wallets, and intermediary nodes. Conversely, there are numerous alternative implementations of Bitcoin Core, and even software forks, that do not change the consensus rules and barring a bug, can coexist on the network and interoperate without causing a hard fork."}
{"prompt": "Consensus rules may differ in obvious and explicit ways, in the validation of transactions or blocks. The rules may also differ in more subtle ways, in the implementation of the consensus rules as they apply to bitcoin scripts or cryptographic primitives such as digital signatures. Finally, the consensus rules may differ in unanticipated ways because of implicit consensus constraints imposed by system limitations or implementation details. An example of the latter was seen in the unanticipated hard fork during the upgrade of Bitcoin Core 0.7 to 0.8, which was caused by a limitation in the Berkeley DB implementation used to store blocks.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Conceptually, we can think of a hard fork as developing in four stages: a software fork, a network fork, a mining fork, and a chain fork."}
{"prompt": "The process begins when an alternative implementation of the client, with modified consensus rules, is created by developers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When this forked implementation is deployed in the network, a certain percentage of miners, wallet users, and intermediate nodes may adopt and run this implementation. A resulting fork will depend upon whether the new consensus rules apply to blocks, transactions, or some other aspect of the system. If the new consensus rules pertain to transactions, then a wallet creating a transaction under the new rules may precipitate a network fork, followed by a hard fork when the transaction is mined into a block. If the new rules pertain to blocks, then the hard fork process will begin when a block is mined under the new rules."}
{"prompt": "First, the network will fork. Nodes based on the original implementation of the consensus rules will reject any transactions and blocks that are created under the new rules. Furthermore, the nodes following the original consensus rules will temporarily ban and disconnect from any nodes that are sending them these invalid transactions and blocks. As a result, the network will partition into two: old nodes will only remain connected to old nodes and new nodes will only be connected to new nodes. A single transaction or block based on the new rules will ripple through the network and result in the partition into two networks.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Once a miner using the new rules mines a block, the mining power and chain will also fork. New miners will mine on top of the new block, while old miners will mine a separate chain based on the old rules. The partitioned network will make it so that the miners operating on separate consensus rules won\u2019t likely receive each other\u2019s blocks, as they are connected to two separate networks."}
{"prompt": "Let\u2019s assume, for example, an 80%\u201320% split, with the majority of the mining power using the new consensus rules. Let\u2019s also assume that the fork occurs immediately after a retargeting period.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The two chains would each inherit the difficulty from the retargeting period. The new consensus rules would have 80% of the previously available mining power committed to them. From the perspective of this chain, the mining power has suddenly declined by 20% vis-a-vis the previous period. Blocks will be found on average every 12.5 minutes, representing the 20% decline in mining power available to extend this chain. This rate of block issuance will continue (barring any changes in hashing power) until 2016 blocks are mined, which will take approximately 25,200 minutes (at 12.5 minutes per block), or 17.5 days. After 17.5 days, a retarget will occur and the difficulty will adjust (reduced by 20%) to produce 10-minute blocks again, based on the reduced amount of hashing power in this chain."}
{"prompt": "This is the dawn of consensus software development. Just as open source development changed both the methods and products of software and created new methodologies, new tools, and new communities in its wake, consensus software development also represents a new frontier in computer science. Out of the debates, experiments, and tribulations of the bitcoin development roadmap, we will see new development tools, practices, methodologies, and communities emerge.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hard forks are seen as risky because they force a minority to either upgrade or remain on a minority chain. The risk of splitting the entire system into two competing systems is seen by many as an unacceptable risk. As a result, many developers are reluctant to use the hard fork mechanism to implement upgrades to the consensus rules, unless there is near-unanimous support from the entire network. Any hard fork proposals that do not have near-unanimous support are considered too \"contentious\" to attempt without risking a partition of the system."}
{"prompt": "The issue of hard forks is highly controversial in the bitcoin development community, especially as it relates to any proposed changes to the consensus rules controlling the maximum block size limit. Some developers are opposed to any form of hard fork, seeing it as too risky. Others see the mechanism of hard fork as an essential tool for upgrading the consensus rules in a way that avoids \"technical debt\" and provides a clean break with the past. Finally, some developers see hard forks as a mechanism that should be used rarely, with a lot of advance planning and only under near-unanimous consensus.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Already we have seen the emergence of new methodologies to address the risks of hard forks. In the next section, we will look at soft forks, and the BIP-34 and BIP-9 methods for signaling and activation of consensus modifications."}
{"prompt": "The term soft fork was introduced to distinguish this upgrade method from a \"hard fork.\" In practice, a soft fork is not a fork at all. A soft fork is a forward-compatible change to the consensus rules that allows non-upgraded clients to continue to operate in consensus with the new rules.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " One aspect of soft forks that is not immediately obvious is that soft fork upgrades can only be used to constrain the consensus rules, not to expand them. In order to be forward compatible, transactions and blocks created under the new rules must be valid under the old rules too, but not vice versa. The new rules can only limit what is valid; otherwise, they will trigger a hard fork when rejected under the old rules."}
{"prompt": "A number of soft forks have been implemented in bitcoin, based on the re-interpretation of NOP opcodes. Bitcoin Script had ten opcodes reserved for future use, NOP1 through NOP10. Under the consensus rules, the presence of these opcodes in a script is interpreted as a null-potent operator, meaning they have no effect. Execution continues after the NOP opcode as if it wasn\u2019t there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A soft fork therefore can modify the semantics of a NOP code to give it new meaning. For example, BIP-65 (CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) reinterpreted the NOP2 opcode. Clients implementing BIP-65 interpret NOP2 as OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and impose an absolute locktime consensus rule on UTXO that contain this opcode in their locking scripts. This change is a soft fork because a transaction that is valid under BIP-65 is also valid on any client that is not implementing (ignorant of) BIP-65. To the old clients, the script contains an NOP code, which is ignored."}

{"prompt": "While signaling bits can be reused or recycled, as long as the voting period does not overlap, the authors of BIP-9 recommend that bits are reused only when necessary; unexpected behavior could occur due to bugs in older software.

{"prompt": "It is important to recognize that there is no perfect solution for consensus development. Both hard forks and soft forks involve tradeoffs.

In time, you may come to see it as I do, as the system\u2019s greatest strength."}
{"prompt": "The core principle in bitcoin is decentralization and it has important implications for security. A centralized model, such as a traditional bank or payment network, depends on access control and vetting to keep bad actors out of the system. By comparison, a decentralized system like bitcoin pushes the responsibility and control to the users. Because security of the network is based on Proof-of-Work, not access control, the network can be open and no encryption is required for bitcoin traffic.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " On a traditional payment network, such as a credit card system, the payment is open-ended because it contains the user\u2019s private identifier (the credit card number). After the initial charge, anyone with access to the identifier can \"pull\" funds and charge the owner again and again. Thus, the payment network has to be secured end-to-end with encryption and must ensure that no eavesdroppers or intermediaries can compromise the payment traffic, in transit or when it is stored (at rest). If a bad actor gains access to the system, he can compromise current transactions and payment tokens that can be used to create new transactions. Worse, when customer data is compromised, the customers are exposed to identity theft and must take action to prevent fraudulent use of the compromised accounts."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin is dramatically different. A bitcoin transaction authorizes only a specific value to a specific recipient and cannot be forged or modified. It does not reveal any private information, such as the identities of the parties, and cannot be used to authorize additional payments. Therefore, a bitcoin payment network does not need to be encrypted or protected from eavesdropping. In fact, you can broadcast bitcoin transactions over an open public channel, such as unsecured WiFi or Bluetooth, with no loss of security.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin\u2019s decentralized security model puts a lot of power in the hands of the users. With that power comes responsibility for maintaining the secrecy of the keys. For most users that is not easy to do, especially on general-purpose computing devices such as internet-connected smartphones or laptops. Although bitcoin\u2019s decentralized model prevents the type of mass compromise seen with credit cards, many users are not able to adequately secure their keys and get hacked, one by one."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin\u2019s security relies on decentralized control over keys and on independent transaction validation by miners. If you want to leverage bitcoin\u2019s security, you need to ensure that you remain within the bitcoin security model. In simple terms: don\u2019t take control of keys away from users and don\u2019t take transactions off the blockchain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " For example, many early bitcoin exchanges concentrated all user funds in a single \"hot\" wallet with keys stored on a single server. Such a design removes control from users and centralizes control over keys in a single system. Many such systems have been hacked, with disastrous consequences for their customers."}
{"prompt": "Another common mistake is to take transactions \"off blockchain\" in a misguided effort to reduce transaction fees or accelerate transaction processing. An \"off blockchain\" system will record transactions on an internal, centralized ledger and only occasionally synchronize them to the Bitcoin blockchain. This practice, again, substitutes decentralized bitcoin security with a proprietary and centralized approach. When transactions are off blockchain, improperly secured centralized ledgers can be falsified, diverting funds and depleting reserves, unnoticed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Unless you are prepared to invest heavily in operational security, multiple layers of access control, and audits (as the traditional banks do) you should think very carefully before taking funds outside of bitcoin\u2019s decentralized security context. Even if you have the funds and discipline to implement a robust security model, such a design merely replicates the fragile model of traditional financial networks, plagued by identity theft, corruption, and embezzlement. To take advantage of bitcoin\u2019s unique decentralized security model, you have to avoid the temptation of centralized architectures that might feel familiar but ultimately subvert bitcoin\u2019s security."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin security architecture is different. In bitcoin, the consensus system creates a trusted public ledger that is completely decentralized. A correctly validated blockchain uses the genesis block as the root of trust, building a chain of trust up to the current block. Bitcoin systems can and should use the blockchain as their root of trust. When designing a complex bitcoin application that consists of services on many different systems, you should carefully examine the security architecture in order to ascertain where trust is being placed. Ultimately, the only thing that should be explicitly trusted is a fully validated blockchain. If your application explicitly or implicitly vests trust in anything but the blockchain, that should be a source of concern because it introduces vulnerability. A good method to evaluate the security architecture of your application is to consider each individual component and evaluate a hypothetical scenario where that component is completely compromised and under the control of a malicious actor. Take each component of your application, in turn, and assess the impacts on the overall security if that component is compromised. If your application is no longer secure when components are compromised, that shows you have misplaced trust in those components. A bitcoin application without vulnerabilities should be vulnerable only to a compromise of the bitcoin consensus mechanism, meaning that its root of trust is based on the strongest part of the bitcoin security architecture.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The numerous examples of hacked bitcoin exchanges serve to underscore this point because their security architecture and design fails even under the most casual scrutiny. These centralized implementations had invested trust explicitly in numerous components outside the Bitcoin blockchain, such as hot wallets, centralized ledger databases, vulnerable encryption keys, and similar schemes."}
{"prompt": "Despite decades of research and advancements in information security, digital assets are still woefully vulnerable to a determined adversary. Even the most highly protected and restricted systems, in financial services companies, intelligence agencies, and defense contractors, are frequently breached. Bitcoin creates digital assets that have intrinsic value and can be stolen and diverted to new owners instantly and irrevocably. This creates a massive incentive for hackers. Until now, hackers had to convert identity information or account tokens\u2014such as credit cards and bank accounts\u2014into value after compromising them. Despite the difficulty of fencing and laundering financial information, we have seen ever-escalating thefts. Bitcoin escalates this problem because it doesn\u2019t need to be fenced or laundered; it is intrinsic value within a digital asset.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Fortunately, bitcoin also creates the incentives to improve computer security. Whereas previously the risk of computer compromise was vague and indirect, bitcoin makes these risks clear and obvious. Holding bitcoin on a computer serves to focus the user\u2019s mind on the need for improved computer security. As a direct result of the proliferation and increased adoption of bitcoin and other digital currencies, we have seen an escalation in both hacking techniques and security solutions. In simple terms, hackers now have a very juicy target and users have a clear incentive to defend themselves."}
{"prompt": "One important security consideration that is often overlooked is availability, especially in the context of incapacity or death of the key holder. Bitcoin users are told to use complex passwords and keep their keys secure and private, not sharing them with anyone. Unfortunately, that practice makes it almost impossible for the user\u2019s family to recover any funds if the user is not available to unlock them.

{"prompt": "Actually, the term channel is a metaphor. State channels are virtual constructs represented by the exchange of state between two parties, outside of the blockchain. There are no \"channels\" per se and the underlying data transport mechanism is not the channel. We use the term channel to represent the relationship and shared state between two parties, outside of the blockchain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To further explain this concept, think of a TCP stream. From the perspective of higher-level protocols it is a \"socket\" connecting two applications across the internet. But if you look at the network traffic, a TCP stream is just a virtual channel over IP packets. Each endpoint of the TCP stream sequences and assembles IP packets to create the illusion of a stream of bytes. Underneath, it\u2019s all disconnected packets. Similarly, a payment channel is just a series of transactions. If properly sequenced and connected, they create redeemable obligations that you can trust even though you don\u2019t trust the other side of the channel."}
{"prompt": "In this section we will look at various forms of payment channels. First, we will examine the mechanisms used to construct a one-way (unidirectional) payment channel for a metered micropayment service, such as streaming video. Then, we will expand on this mechanism and introduce bidirectional payment channels. Finally, we will look at how bidirectional channels can be connected end-to-end to form multihop channels in a routed network, first proposed under the name Lightning Network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Payment channels are part of the broader concept of a state channel, which represents an off-chain alteration of state, secured by eventual settlement in a blockchain. A payment channel is a state channel where the state being altered is the balance of a virtual currency."}
{"prompt": "State Channels\u2014Basic Concepts and Terminology\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A state channel is established between two parties, through a transaction that locks a shared state on the blockchain. This is called the funding transaction or anchor transaction. This single transaction must be transmitted to the network and mined to establish the channel. In the example of a payment channel, the locked state is the initial balance (in currency) of the channel."}
{"prompt": "The two parties then exchange signed transactions, called commitment transactions, that alter the initial state. These transactions are valid transactions in that they could be submitted for settlement by either party, but instead are held off-chain by each party pending the channel closure. State updates can be created as fast as each party can create, sign, and transmit a transaction to the other party. In practice this means that thousands of transactions per second can be exchanged.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When exchanging commitment transactions the two parties also invalidate the previous states, so that the most up-to-date commitment transaction is always the only one that can be redeemed. This prevents either party from cheating by unilaterally closing the channel with an expired prior state that is more favorable to them than the current state. We will examine the various mechanisms that can be used to invalidate prior state in the rest of this chapter."}
{"prompt": "Finally, the channel can be closed either cooperatively, by submitting a final settlement transaction to the blockchain, or unilaterally, by either party submitting the last commitment transaction to the blockchain. A unilateral close option is needed in case one of the parties unexpectedly disconnects. The settlement transaction represents the final state of the channel and is settled on the blockchain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the entire lifetime of the channel, only two transactions need to be submitted for mining on the blockchain: the funding and settlement transactions. In between these two states, the two parties can exchange any number of commitment transactions that are never seen by anyone else, nor submitted to the blockchain."}

{"prompt": "For this example we will assume two participants: Emma and Fabian. Fabian offers a video streaming service that is billed by the second using a micropayment channel. Fabian charges 0.01 millibit (0.00001 BTC) per second of video, equivalent to 36 millibits (0.036 BTC) per hour of video. Emma is a user who purchases this streaming video service from Fabian. Emma purchases streaming video from Fabian with a payment channel, paying for each second of video shows Emma buying the video streaming service from Fabian using a payment channel.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Figure 2. Emma purchases streaming video from Fabian with a payment channel, paying for each second of video"}
{"prompt": "In this example, Fabian and Emma are using special software that handles both the payment channel and the video streaming. Emma is running the software in her browser, Fabian is running it on a server. The software includes basic bitcoin wallet functionality and can create and sign bitcoin transactions. Both the concept and the term \"payment channel\" are completely hidden from the users. What they see is video that is paid for by the second.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To set up the payment channel, Emma and Fabian establish a 2-of-2 multisignature address, with each of them holding one of the keys. From Emma\u2019s perspective, the software in her browser presents a QR code with a P2SH address (starting with \"3\"), and asks her to submit a \"deposit\" for up to 1 hour of video. The address is then funded by Emma. Emma\u2019s transaction, paying to the multisignature address, is the funding or anchor transaction for the payment channel."}
{"prompt": "For this example, let\u2019s say that Emma funds the channel with 36 millibits (0.036 BTC). This will allow Emma to consume up to 1 hour of streaming video. The funding transaction in this case sets the maximum amount that can be transmitted in this channel, setting the channel capacity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The funding transaction consumes one or more inputs from Emma\u2019s wallet, sourcing the funds. It creates one output with a value of 36 millibits paid to the multisignature 2-of-2 address controlled jointly between Emma and Fabian. It may have additional outputs for change back to Emma\u2019s wallet."}
{"prompt": "Once the funding transaction is confirmed, Emma can start streaming video. Emma\u2019s software creates and signs a commitment transaction that changes the channel balance to credit 0.01 millibit to Fabian\u2019s address and refund 35.99 millibits back to Emma. The transaction signed by Emma consumes the 36 millibits output created by the funding transaction and creates two outputs: one for her refund, the other for Fabian\u2019s payment. The transaction is only partially signed\u2014it requires two signatures (2-of-2), but only has Emma\u2019s signature. When Fabian\u2019s server receives this transaction, it adds the second signature (for the 2-of-2 input) and returns it to Emma together with 1 second worth of video. Now both parties have a fully signed commitment transaction that either can redeem, representing the correct up-to-date balance of the channel. Neither party broadcasts this transaction to the network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the next round, Emma\u2019s software creates and signs another commitment transaction (commitment #2) that consumes the same 2-of-2 output from the funding transaction. The second commitment transaction allocates one output of 0.02 millibits to Fabian\u2019s address and one output of 35.98 millibits back to Emma\u2019s address. This new transaction is payment for two cumulative seconds of video. Fabian\u2019s software signs and returns the second commitment transaction, together with another second of video."}
{"prompt": "In this way, Emma\u2019s software continues to send commitment transactions to Fabian\u2019s server in exchange for streaming video. The balance of the channel gradually accumulates in favor of Fabian, as Emma consumes more seconds of video. Let\u2019s say Emma watches 600 seconds (10 minutes) of video, creating and signing 600 commitment transactions. The last commitment transaction (#600) will have two outputs, splitting the balance of the channel, 6 millibits to Fabian and 30 millibits to Emma.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Finally, Emma selects \"Stop\" to stop streaming video. Either Fabian or Emma can now transmit the final state transaction for settlement. This last transaction is the settlement transaction and pays Fabian for all the video Emma consumed, refunding the remainder of the funding transaction to Emma."}
{"prompt": "Emma\u2019s payment channel with Fabian, showing the commitment transactions that update the balance of the channel shows the channel between Emma and Fabian and the commitment transactions that update the balance of the channel.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the end, only two transactions are recorded on the blockchain: the funding transaction that established the channel and a settlement transaction that allocated the final balance correctly between the two participants."}
{"prompt": "The channel we just described works, but only if both parties cooperate, without any failures or attempts to cheat. Let\u2019s look at some of the scenarios that break this channel and see what is needed to fix those:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Once the funding transaction happens, Emma needs Fabian\u2019s signature to get any money back. If Fabian disappears, Emma\u2019s funds are locked in a 2-of-2 and effectively lost. This channel, as constructed, leads to a loss of funds if one of the parties disconnects before there is at least one commitment transaction signed by both parties."}
{"prompt": "While the channel is running, Emma can take any of the commitment transactions Fabian has countersigned and transmit one to the blockchain. Why pay for 600 seconds of video, if she can transmit commitment transaction #1 and only pay for 1 second of video? The channel fails because Emma can cheat by broadcasting a prior commitment that is in her favor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Both of these problems can be solved with timelocks\u2014let\u2019s look at how we could use transaction-level timelocks (nLocktime)."}
{"prompt": "Emma cannot risk funding a 2-of-2 multisig unless she has a guaranteed refund. To solve this problem, Emma constructs the funding and refund transactions at the same time. She signs the funding transaction but doesn\u2019t transmit it to anyone. Emma transmits only the refund transaction to Fabian and obtains his signature.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The refund transaction acts as the first commitment transaction and its timelock establishes the upper bound for the channel\u2019s life. In this case, Emma could set the nLocktime to 30 days or 4320 blocks into the future. All subsequent commitment transactions must have a shorter timelock, so that they can be redeemed before the refund transaction."}
{"prompt": "Now that Emma has a fully signed refund transaction, she can confidently transmit the signed funding transaction knowing that she can eventually, after the timelock expires, redeem the refund transaction even if Fabian disappears.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Every commitment transaction the parties exchange during the life of the channel will be timelocked into the future. But the delay will be slightly shorter for each commitment so the most recent commitment can be redeemed before the prior commitment it invalidates. Because of the nLockTime, neither party can successfully propagate any of the commitment transactions until their timelock expires. If all goes well, they will cooperate and close the channel gracefully with a settlement transaction, making it unnecessary to transmit an intermediate commitment transaction. If not, the most recent commitment transaction can be propagated to settle the account and invalidate all prior commitment transactions."}
{"prompt": "For example, if commitment transaction #1 is timelocked to 4320 blocks in the future, then commitment transaction #2 is timelocked to 4319 blocks in the future. Commitment transaction #600 can be spent 600 blocks before commitment transaction #1 becomes valid.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Each commitment sets a shorter timelock, allowing it to be spent before the previous commitments become valid shows each commitment transaction setting a shorter timelock, allowing it to be spent before the previous commitments become valid."}
{"prompt": "Figure 4. Each commitment sets a shorter timelock, allowing it to be spent before the previous commitments become valid\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Each subsequent commitment transaction must have a shorter timelock so that it may be broadcast before its predecessors and before the refund transaction. The ability to broadcast a commitment earlier ensures it will be able to spend the funding output and preclude any other commitment transaction from being redeemed by spending the output. The guarantees offered by the Bitcoin blockchain, preventing double-spends and enforcing timelocks, effectively allow each commitment transaction to invalidate its predecessors."}
{"prompt": "State channels use timelocks to enforce smart contracts across a time dimension. In this example we saw how the time dimension guarantees that the most recent commitment transaction becomes valid before any earlier commitments. Thus, the most recent commitment transaction can be transmitted, spending the inputs and invalidating prior commitment transactions. The enforcement of smart contracts with absolute timelocks protects against cheating by one of the parties. This implementation needs nothing more than absolute transaction-level timelocks (nLocktime). Next, we will see how script-level timelocks, CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY, can be used to construct more flexible, useful, and sophisticated state channels.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The first form of unidirectional payment channel was demonstrated as a prototype video streaming application in 2015 by an Argentinian team of developers."}
{"prompt": "Timelocks are not the only way to invalidate prior commitment transactions. In the next sections we will see how a revocation key can be used to achieve the same result. Timelocks are effective but they have two distinct disadvantages. By establishing a maximum timelock when the channel is first opened, they limit the lifetime of the channel. Worse, they force channel implementations to strike a balance between allowing long-lived channels and forcing one of the participants to wait a very long time for a refund in case of premature closure. For example, if you allow the channel to remain open for 30 days, by setting the refund timelock to 30 days, if one of the parties disappears immediately the other party must wait 30 days for a refund. The more distant the endpoint, the more distant the refund.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The second problem is that since each subsequent commitment transaction must decrement the timelock, there is an explicit limit on the number of commitment transactions that can be exchanged between the parties. For example, a 30-day channel, setting a timelock of 4320 blocks into the future, can only accommodate 4320 intermediate commitment transactions before it must be closed. There is a danger in setting the timelock commitment transaction interval at 1 block. By setting the timelock interval between commitment transactions to 1 block, a developer is creating a very high burden for the channel participants who have to be vigilant, remain online and watching, and be ready to transmit the right commitment transaction at any time."}
{"prompt": "A better way to handle the prior commitment states is to explicitly revoke them. However, this is not easy to achieve. A key characteristic of bitcoin is that once a transaction is valid, it remains valid and does not expire. The only way to cancel a transaction is by double-spending its inputs with another transaction before it is mined. That\u2019s why we used timelocks in the simple payment channel example above to ensure that more recent commitments could be spent before older commitments were valid. However, sequencing commitments in time creates a number of constraints that make payment channels difficult to use.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Even though a transaction cannot be canceled, it can be constructed in such a way as to make it undesirable to use. The way we do that is by giving each party a revocation key that can be used to punish the other party if they try to cheat. This mechanism for revoking prior commitment transactions was first proposed as part of the Lightning Network."}
{"prompt": "To explain revocation keys, we will construct a more complex payment channel between two exchanges run by Hitesh and Irene. Hitesh and Irene run bitcoin exchanges in India and the USA, respectively. Customers of Hitesh\u2019s Indian exchange often send payments to customers of Irene\u2019s USA exchange and vice versa. Currently, these transactions occur on the Bitcoin blockchain, but this means paying fees and waiting several blocks for confirmations. Setting up a payment channel between the exchanges will significantly reduce the cost and accelerate the transaction flow.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hitesh and Irene start the channel by collaboratively constructing a funding transaction, each funding the channel with 5 bitcoin. The initial balance is 5 bitcoin for Hitesh and 5 bitcoin for Irene. The funding transaction locks the channel state in a 2-of-2 multisig, just like in the example of a simple channel."}
{"prompt": "The funding transaction may have one or more inputs from Hitesh (adding up to 5 bitcoin or more), and one or more inputs from Irene (adding up to 5 bitcoin or more). The inputs have to slightly exceed the channel capacity in order to cover the transaction fees. The transaction has one output that locks the 10 total bitcoin to a 2-of-2 multisig address controlled by both Hitesh and Irene. The funding transaction may also have one or more outputs returning change to Hitesh and Irene if their inputs exceeded their intended channel contribution. This is a single transaction with inputs offered and signed by two parties. It has to be constructed in collaboration and signed by each party before it is transmitted.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Now, instead of creating a single commitment transaction that both parties sign, Hitesh and Irene create two different commitment transactions that are asymmetric."}
{"prompt": "Hitesh has a commitment transaction with two outputs. The first output pays Irene the 5 bitcoin she is owed immediately.

{"prompt": "This way, each party has a commitment transaction, spending the 2-of-2 funding output. This input is signed by the other party. At any time the party holding the transaction can also sign (completing the 2-of-2) and broadcast. However, if they broadcast the commitment transaction, it pays the other party immediately whereas they have to wait for a timelock to expire. By imposing a delay on the redemption of one of the outputs, we put each party at a slight disadvantage when they choose to unilaterally broadcast a commitment transaction. But a time delay alone isn\u2019t enough to encourage fair conduct.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Two asymmetric commitment transactions with delayed payment for the party holding the transaction shows two asymmetric commitment transactions, where the output paying the holder of the commitment is delayed."}

It is similar to a 2-of-2 multisig, but constructed using elliptic curve arithmetic, so that both parties know the revocation public key but each party knows only half the revocation secret key.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In each round, both parties reveal their half of the revocation secret to the other party, thereby giving the other party (who now has both halves) the means to claim the penalty output if this revoked transaction is ever broadcast."}
{"prompt": "Each of the commitment transactions has a \"delayed\" output. The redemption script for that output allows one party to redeem it after 1000 blocks, or the other party to redeem it if they have a revocation key, penalizing transmission of a revoked commitment.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " So when Hitesh creates a commitment transaction for Irene to sign, he makes the second output payable to himself after 1000 blocks, or to the revocation public key (of which he only knows half the secret). Hitesh constructs this transaction. He will only reveal his half of the revocation secret to Irene when he is ready to move to a new channel state and wants to revoke this commitment."}
{"prompt": "When the channel is advanced to the next state, Hitesh has to revoke this commitment transaction before Irene agrees to sign the next commitment transaction. To do that, all he has to do is send his half of the revocation key to Irene. Once Irene has both halves of the revocation secret key for this commitment, she can sign the next commitment with confidence. She knows that if Hitesh tries to cheat by publishing the prior commitment, she can use the revocation key to redeem Hitesh\u2019s delayed output. If Hitesh cheats, Irene gets BOTH outputs. Meanwhile, Hitesh only has half the revocation secret for that revocation public key and can\u2019t redeem the output until 1000 blocks. Irene will be able to redeem the output and punish Hitesh before the 1000 blocks have elapsed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The revocation protocol is bilateral, meaning that in each round, as the channel state is advanced, the two parties exchange new commitments, exchange revocation secrets for the previous commitments, and sign each other\u2019s new commitment transactions. As they accept a new state, they make the prior state impossible to use, by giving each other the necessary revocation secrets to punish any cheating."}
{"prompt": "Let\u2019s look at an example of how it works. One of Irene\u2019s customers wants to send 2 bitcoin to one of Hitesh\u2019s customers. To transmit 2 bitcoin across the channel, Hitesh and Irene must advance the channel state to reflect the new balance. They will commit to a new state (state number 2) where the channel\u2019s 10 bitcoin are split, 7 bitcoin to Hitesh and 3 bitcoin to Irene. To advance the state of the channel, they will each create new commitment transactions reflecting the new channel balance.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As before, these commitment transactions are asymmetric so that the commitment transaction each party holds forces them to wait if they redeem it. Crucially, before signing new commitment transactions, they must first exchange revocation keys to invalidate the prior commitment. In this particular case, Hitesh\u2019s interests are aligned with the real state of the channel and therefore he has no reason to broadcast a prior state. However, for Irene, state number 1 leaves her with a higher balance than state 2. When Irene gives Hitesh the revocation key for her prior commitment transaction (state number 1) she is effectively revoking her ability to profit from regressing the channel to a prior state because with the revocation key, Hitesh can redeem both outputs of the prior commitment transaction without delay. Meaning if Irene broadcasts the prior state, Hitesh can exercise his right to take all of the outputs."}
{"prompt": "Importantly, the revocation doesn\u2019t happen automatically. While Hitesh has the ability to punish Irene for cheating, he has to watch the blockchain diligently for signs of cheating. If he sees a prior commitment transaction broadcast, he has 1000 blocks to take action and use the revocation key to thwart Irene\u2019s cheating and punish her by taking the entire balance, all 10 bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Asymmetric revocable commitments with relative time locks (CSV) are a much better way to implement payment channels and a very significant innovation in this technology. With this construct, the channel can remain open indefinitely and can have billions of intermediate commitment transactions. In prototype implementations of Lightning Network, the commitment state is identified by a 48-bit index, allowing more than 281 trillion (2.8 x 1014) state transitions in any single channel!"}
{"prompt": "This produces a hash H that can be included in an output\u2019s locking script. Whoever knows the secret can use it to redeem the output. The secret R is also referred to as a preimage to the hash function. The preimage is just the data that is used as input to a hash function.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The second part of an HTLC is the \"time lock\" component. If the secret is not revealed, the payer of the HTLC can get a \"refund\" after some time. This is achieved with an absolute time lock using CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY."}
{"prompt": "If the secret is not revealed and the HTLC claimed, after a certain number of blocks the payer can claim a refund using the second clause in the IF flow.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This is a basic implementation of an HTLC. This type of HTLC can be redeemed by anyone who has the secret R. An HTLC can take many different forms with slight variations to the script. For example, adding a CHECKSIG operator and a public key in the first clause restricts redemption of the hash to a named recipient, who must also know the secret R."}
{"prompt": "Routed Payment Channels (Lightning Network)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Lightning Network is a proposed routed network of bidirectional payment channels connected end-to-end. A network like this can allow any participant to route a payment from channel to channel without trusting any of the intermediaries.

A series of bidirectional payment channels linked to form a Lightning Network that can route a payment from Alice to Eric"}
{"prompt": "Alice wants to pay Eric 1 bitcoin. However, Alice is not connected to Eric by a payment channel. Creating a payment channel requires a funding transaction, which must be committed to the Bitcoin blockchain. Alice does not want to open a new payment channel and commit more of her funds. Is there a way to pay Eric, indirectly?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network shows the step-by-step process of routing a payment from Alice to Eric, through a series of HTLC commitments on the payment channels connecting the participants."}

Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Alice is running a Lightning Network (LN) node that is keeping track of her payment channel to Bob and has the ability to discover routes between payment channels. Alice\u2019s LN node also has the ability to connect over the internet to Eric\u2019s LN node. Eric\u2019s LN node creates a secret R using a random number generator. Eric\u2019s node does not reveal this secret to anyone. Instead, Eric\u2019s node calculates a hash H of the secret R and transmits this hash to Alice\u2019s node (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 1)."}
{"prompt": "Now Alice\u2019s LN node constructs a route between Alice\u2019s LN node and Eric\u2019s LN node. The routing algorithm used will be examined in more detail later, but for now let\u2019s assume that Alice\u2019s node can find an efficient route.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Alice\u2019s node then constructs an HTLC, payable to the hash H, with a 10-block refund timeout (current block + 10), for an amount of 1.003 bitcoin (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 2). The extra 0.003 will be used to compensate the intermediate nodes for their participation in this payment route. Alice offers this HTLC to Bob, deducting 1.003 bitcoin from her channel balance with Bob and committing it to the HTLC. The HTLC has the following meaning: \"Alice is committing 1.003 of her channel balance to be paid to Bob if Bob knows the secret, or refunded back to Alice\u2019s balance if 10 blocks elapse.\" The channel balance between Alice and Bob is now expressed by commitment transactions with three outputs: 2 bitcoin balance to Bob, 0.997 bitcoin balance to Alice, 1.003 bitcoin committed in Alice\u2019s HTLC. Alice\u2019s balance is reduced by the amount committed to the HTLC."}
{"prompt": "Bob now has a commitment that if he is able to get the secret R within the next 10 blocks, he can claim the 1.003 locked by Alice. With this commitment in hand, Bob\u2019s node constructs an HTLC on his payment channel with Carol. Bob\u2019s HTLC commits 1.002 bitcoin to hash H for 9 blocks, which Carol can redeem if she has secret R (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 3). Bob knows that if Carol can claim his HTLC, she has to produce R. If Bob has R in nine blocks, he can use it to claim Alice\u2019s HTLC to him. He also makes 0.001 bitcoin for committing his channel balance for nine blocks. If Carol is unable to claim his HTLC and he is unable to claim Alice\u2019s HTLC, everything reverts back to the prior channel balances and no one is at a loss. The channel balance between Bob and Carol is now: 2 to Carol, 0.998 to Bob, 1.002 committed by Bob to the HTLC.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Carol now has a commitment that if she gets R within the next nine blocks, she can claim 1.002 bitcoin locked by Bob. Now she can make an HTLC commitment on her channel with Diana. She commits an HTLC of 1.001 bitcoin to hash H, for eight blocks, which Diana can redeem if she has secret R (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 4). From Carol\u2019s perspective, if this works she is 0.001 bitcoin better off and if it doesn\u2019t she loses nothing. Her HTLC to Diana is only viable if R is revealed, at which point she can claim the HTLC from Bob. The channel balance between Carol and Diana is now: 2 to Diana, 0.999 to Carol, 1.001 committed by Carol to the HTLC."}
{"prompt": "Finally, Diana can offer an HTLC to Eric, committing 1 bitcoin for seven blocks to hash H (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 5). The channel balance between Diana and Eric is now: 2 to Eric, 1 to Diana, 1 committed by Diana to the HTLC.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " However, at this hop in the route, Eric has secret R. He can therefore claim the HTLC offered by Diana. He sends R to Diana and claims the 1 bitcoin, adding it to his channel balance (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 6). The channel balance is now: 1 to Diana, 3 to Eric."}
{"prompt": "Now, Diana has secret R. Therefore, she can now claim the HTLC from Carol. Diana transmits R to Carol and adds the 1.001 bitcoin to her channel balance (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 7). Now the channel balance between Carol and Diana is: 0.999 to Carol, 3.001 to Diana. Diana has \"earned\" 0.001 for participating in this payment route.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Flowing back through the route, the secret R allows each participant to claim the outstanding HTLCs. Carol claims 1.002 from Bob, setting the balance on their channel to: 0.998 to Bob, 3.002 to Carol (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 8). Finally, Bob claims the HTLC from Alice (see Step-by-step payment routing through a Lightning Network step 9). Their channel balance is updated as: 0.997 to Alice, 3.003 to Bob."}
{"prompt": "All communications between LN nodes are encrypted point-to-point. In addition, nodes have a long-term public key that they use as an identifier and to authenticate each other.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Whenever a node wishes to send a payment to another node, it must first construct a path through the network by connecting payment channels with sufficient capacity. Nodes advertise routing information, including what channels they have open, how much capacity each channel has, and what fees they charge to route payments. The routing information can be shared in a variety of ways and different routing protocols are likely to emerge as Lightning Network technology advances. Some Lightning Network implementations use the IRC protocol as a convenient mechanism for nodes to announce routing information. Another implementation of route discovery uses a P2P model where nodes propagate channel announcements to their peers, in a \"flooding\" model, similar to how bitcoin propagates transactions. Future plans include a proposal called Flare, which is a hybrid routing model with local node \"neighborhoods\" and longer-range beacon nodes."}
{"prompt": "In our previous example, Alice\u2019s node uses one of these route discovery mechanisms to find one or more paths connecting her node to Eric\u2019s node. Once Alice\u2019s node has constructed a path, she will initialize that path through the network, by propagating a series of encrypted and nested instructions to connect each of the adjacent payment channels.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Importantly, this path is only known to Alice\u2019s node. All other participants in the payment route see only the adjacent nodes. From Carol\u2019s perspective, this looks like a payment from Bob to Diana. Carol does not know that Bob is actually relaying a payment from Alice. She also doesn\u2019t know that Diana will be relaying a payment to Eric."}
{"prompt": "This is a critical feature of the Lightning Network, because it ensures privacy of payments and makes it very difficult to apply surveillance, censorship, or blacklists. But how does Alice establish this payment path, without revealing anything to the intermediary nodes?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Lightning Network implements an onion-routed protocol based on a scheme called Sphinx. This routing protocol ensures that a payment sender can construct and communicate a path through the Lightning Network such that:"}
{"prompt": "Intermediate nodes can verify and decrypt their portion of route information and find the next hop.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Other than the previous and next hops, they cannot learn about any other nodes that are part of the path."}
{"prompt": "They cannot identify the length of the payment path, or their own position in that path.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Each part of the path is encrypted in such a way that a network-level attacker cannot associate the packets from different parts of the path to each other."}
{"prompt": "Unlike Tor (an onion-routed anonymization protocol on the internet), there are no \"exit nodes\" that can be placed under surveillance. The payments do not need to be transmitted to the Bitcoin blockchain; the nodes just update channel balances.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Using this onion-routed protocol, Alice wraps each element of the path in a layer of encryption, starting with the end and working backward. She encrypts a message to Eric with Eric\u2019s public key. This message is wrapped in a message encrypted to Diana, identifying Eric as the next recipient. The message to Diana is wrapped in a message encrypted to Carol\u2019s public key and identifying Diana as the next recipient. The message to Carol is encrypted to Bob\u2019s key. Thus, Alice has constructed this encrypted multilayer \"onion\" of messages. She sends this to Bob, who can only decrypt and unwrap the outer layer. Inside, Bob finds a message addressed to Carol that he can forward to Carol but cannot decipher himself. Following the path, the messages get forwarded, decrypted, forwarded, etc., all the way to Eric. Each participant knows only the previous and next node in each hop."}
{"prompt": "Each element of the path contains information on the HTLC that must be extended to the next hop, the amount that is being sent, the fee to include, and the CLTV locktime (in blocks) expiration of the HTLC. As the route information propagates, the nodes make HTLC commitments forward to the next hop.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " At this point, you might be wondering how it is possible that the nodes do not know the length of the path and their position in that path. After all, they receive a message and forward it to the next hop. Doesn\u2019t it get shorter, allowing them to deduce the path size and their position? To prevent this, the path is always fixed at 20 hops and padded with random data. Each node sees the next hop and a fixed-length encrypted message to forward. Only the final recipient sees that there is no next hop. To everyone else it seems as if there are always 20 more hops to go."}
{"prompt": "A Lightning Network uses bitcoin transactions between nodes that operate as peers without trusting each other. Thus, a Lightning Network preserves the principles of the Bitcoin system, while expanding its operating parameters significantly.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Of course, as mentioned previously, the Lightning Network protocol is not the only way to implement routed payment channels. Other proposed systems include Tumblebit and Teechan. At this time, however, the Lightning Network has already been deployed on testnet. Several different teams have developed competing implementations of LN and are working toward a common interoperability standard (called BOLT). It is likely that Lightning Network will be the first routed payment channel network to be deployed in production."}
{"prompt": "It is costly. EFTs in Europe can cost 25 euros. Credit transactions can cost several percent of the transaction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It is slow. Checking and low cost wire services take days to complete."}
{"prompt": "New coins are slowly mined into existence by following a mutually agreed-upon set of rules. A user mining bitcoins is running a software program that searches for a solution to a very difficult math problem the difficulty of which is precisely known. This difficulty is automatically adjusted on a predictable schedule so that the number of solutions found globally for a given unit of time is constant: the global system aims for 6 per hour. When a solution is found, the user may tell everyone of the existence of this newly found solution along with other information packaged together in what is called a \"block\". The solution itself is a proof-of-work or PoW. It is hard to find, but easy to verify.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Blocks create 12.5 new bitcoins at present [October 2016]. This amount, known as the block reward, is an incentive for people to perform the computation work required for generating blocks. Roughly every 4 years, the number of bitcoins that can be \"mined\" in a block reduces by 50%. Originally the block reward was 50 bitcoins; it halved in November 2012; it then halved again in July 2016. Any block that is created by a malicious user that does not follow this rule (or any other rules) will be rejected by everyone else. In the end, no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever exist."}
{"prompt": "To guarantee that a third-party, let's call her Eve, cannot spend other people's bitcoins by creating transactions in their names, Bitcoin uses public key cryptography to make and verify digital signatures. In this system, each person, such as Alice or Bob, has one or more addresses each with an associated pair of public and private keys that they may hold in a wallet. Only the user with the private key can sign a transaction to give some of their bitcoins to somebody else, but anyone can validate the signature using that user\u2019s public key.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Suppose Alice wants to send a bitcoin to Bob."}

The rest is done by the Bitcoin client software.)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Looking at this transaction from the outside, anyone who knows that these addresses belong to Alice and Bob can see that Alice has agreed to transfer the amount to Bob, because nobody else has Alice's private key. Alice would be foolish to give her private key to other people, as this would allow them to sign transactions in her name, removing funds from her control."}
{"prompt": "Bob adds Charlie's address and the amount of bitcoins to transfer to a message: a 'transaction' message.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bob signs the transaction with his private key, and announces his public key for signature verification."}

The following process does; this is the primary innovation behind Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Details about the transaction are sent and forwarded to all or as many other computers as possible."}
{"prompt": "A constantly growing chain of blocks that contains a record of all transactions is collectively maintained by all computers (each has a full copy).\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To be accepted in the chain, transaction blocks must be valid and must include proof of work (one block generated by the network every 10 minutes)."}

{"prompt": "When it comes to the Bitcoin network itself, there are no \"accounts\" to set up, and no e-mail addresses, user-names or passwords are required to hold or spend bitcoins. Each balance is simply associated with an address and its public-private key pair. The money \"belongs\" to anyone who has the private key and can sign transactions with it. Moreover, those keys do not have to be registered anywhere in advance, as they are only used when required for a transaction. Transacting parties do not need to know each other's identity in the same way that a store owner does not know a cash-paying customer's name.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A Bitcoin address mathematically corresponds to a public key and looks like this:"}
{"prompt": "Next, navigate to one of these blocks. The block's hash begins with a run of zeros. This is what made creating the block so difficult; a hash that begins with many zeros is much more difficult to find than a hash with few or no zeros. The computer that generated this block had to try many Nonce values (also listed on the block's page) until it found one that generated this run of zeros. Next, see the line titled Previous block. Each block contains the hash of the block that came before it. This is what forms the chain of blocks. Now take a look at all the transactions the block contains. The first transaction is the income earned by the computer that generated this block. It includes a fixed amount of coins created out of \"thin air\" and possibly a fee collected from other transactions in the same block.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Drill down into any of the transactions and you will see how it is made up of one or more amounts coming in and out. Having more than one incoming and outgoing amount in a transaction enables the system to join and break amounts in any possible way, allowing for any fractional amount needed. Each incoming amount is a past transaction (which you can also view) from someone's address, and each outgoing amount is addressed to someone and will be part of a future transaction (which you can also navigate down into if it has already taken place.)"}

Please refer to the Subjective Theory of Value.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " See also: the \"Bitcoin is backed by processing power\" myth."}
{"prompt": "The value of bitcoins are based on how much electricity and computing power it takes to mine them\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This statement is an attempt to apply to Bitcoin the labor theory of value, which is generally accepted as false. Just because something takes X resources to create does not mean that the resulting product will be worth X. It can be worth more, or less, depending on the utility thereof to its users."}
{"prompt": "In fact the causality is the reverse of that (this applies to the labor theory of value in general). The cost to mine bitcoins is based on how much they are worth. If bitcoins go up in value, more people will mine (because mining is profitable), thus difficulty will go up, thus the cost of mining will go up. The inverse happens if bitcoins go down in value. These effects balance out to cause mining to always cost an amount proportional to the value of bitcoins it produces[1].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin has no intrinsic value (unlike some other things)"}
{"prompt": "This is simply not true. Each bitcoin gives the holder the ability to embed a large number of short in-transaction messages in a globally distributed and timestamped permanent data store, namely the bitcoin blockchain. There is no other similar datastore which is so widely distributed. There is a tradeoff between the exact number of messages and how quickly they can be embedded. But as of December 2013, it's fair to say that one bitcoin allows around 1000 such messages to be embedded, each within about 10 minutes of being sent, since a fee of 0.001 BTC is enough to get transactions confirmed quickly. This message embedding certainly has intrinsic value since it can be used to prove ownership of a document at a certain time, by including a one-way hash of that document in a transaction. Considering that electronic notarization services charge something like $10/document, this would give an intrinsic value of around $10,000 per bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " While some other tangible commodities do have intrinsic value, that value is generally much less than its trading price. Consider for example that gold, if it were not used as an inflation-proof store of value, but rather only for its industrial uses, would certainly not be worth what it is today, since the industrial requirements for gold are far smaller than the available supply thereof."}
{"prompt": "In any event, while historically intrinsic value, as well as other attributes like divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, durability, helped establish certain commodities as mediums of exchange, it is certainly not a prerequisite. While bitcoins are accused of lacking 'intrinsic value' in this sense, they make up for it in spades by possessing the other qualities necessary to make it a good medium of exchange, equal to or better than commodity money.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Another way to think about this is to consider the value of bitcoin the global network, rather than each bitcoin in isolation. The value of an individual telephone is derived from the network it is connected to. If there was no phone network, a telephone would be useless. Similarly the value of an individual bitcoin derives from the global network of bitcoin-enabled merchants, exchanges, wallets, etc... Just like a phone is necessary to transmit vocal information through the network, a bitcoin is necessary to transmit economic information through the network."}
{"prompt": "Value is ultimately determined by what people are willing to trade for - by supply and demand.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin is illegal because it's not legal tender"}
{"prompt": "In March 2013, the U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issues a new set of guidelines on \"de-centralized virtual currency\", clearly targeting Bitcoin. Under the new guidelines, \"a user of virtual currency is not a Money Services Businesses (MSB) under FinCEN's regulations and therefore is not subject to MSB registration, reporting, and record keeping regulations.\" [2] Miners, when mining bitcoins for their own personal use, aren't required to register as a MSB or Money Transmitter.

A currency is, after all, nothing more than a convenient unit of account. While national laws may vary from country to country, and you should certainly check the laws of your jurisdiction, in general trading in any commodity, including digital currency like Bitcoin, BerkShares, game currencies like WoW gold, or Linden dollars, is not illegal."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin is a form of domestic terrorism because it only harms the economic stability of the USA and its currency\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " According to the definition of terrorism in the United States, you need to do violent activities to be considered a terrorist for legal purposes. Recent off-the-cuff remarks by politicians have no basis in law or fact."}

It is up to you to follow the applicable tax laws in your home country, or face the consequences.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " While it may be easy to transfer bitcoins pseudonymously, spending them on tangibles is just as hard as spending any other kind of money anonymously. Tax evaders are often caught because their lifestyle and assets are inconsistent with their reported income, and not necessarily because government is able to follow their money."}

{"prompt": "Early adopters are rewarded for taking the higher risk with their time and money. The capital invested in bitcoin at each stage of its life invigorated the community and helped the currency to reach subsequent milestones. Arguing that early adopters do not deserve to profit from this is akin to saying that early investors in a company, or people who buy stock at a company IPO (Initial Public Offering), are unfairly rewarded.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This argument also depends on bitcoin early adopters using bitcoins to store rather than transfer value. The daily trade on the exchanges (as of Jan 2012) indicates that smaller transactions are becoming the norm, indicating trade rather than investment. In more pragmatic terms, \"fairness\" is an arbitrary concept that is improbable to be agreed upon by a large population. Establishing \"fairness\" is no goal of Bitcoin, as this would be impossible."}
{"prompt": "Looking forwards, considering the amount of publicity bitcoin received as of April 2013, there can be no reasonable grounds for complaint for people who did not invest at that time, and then see the value (possibly) rising drastically higher.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " By starting to mine or acquire bitcoins today, you too can become an early adopter."}

In other words, each bitcoin is divisible by up to 108.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grew too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people started dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (\u03bcBTC)."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoins are stored in wallet files, just copy the wallet file to get more coins!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " No, your wallet contains your secret keys, giving you the rights to spend your bitcoins. Think of it like having bank details stored in a file. If you give your bank details (or bitcoin wallet) to someone else, that doesn't double the amount of money in your account. You can spend your money or they can spend your money, but not both."}
{"prompt": "Lost coins can't be replaced and this is bad\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoins are divisible to 0.00000001, so there being fewer bitcoins remaining is not a problem for the currency itself. If you lose your coins, indirectly all other coins are worth more due to the reduced supply. Consider it a donation to all other bitcoin users."}
{"prompt": "In a Ponzi Scheme, the founders persuade investors that they\u2019ll profit. Bitcoin does not make such a guarantee. There is no central entity, just individuals building an economy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A Ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. In a Ponzi scheme, early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters, and the late adopters always lose. Bitcoin can have a win-win outcome. Earlier adopters profit from the rise in value as Bitcoin becomes better understood and in turn demanded by the public at large. All adopters benefit from the usefulness of a reliable and widely-accepted decentralized peer-to-peer currency.[4]"}

{"prompt": "As deflationary forces may apply, economic factors such as hoarding are offset by human factors that may lessen the chances that a Deflationary spiral will occur.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin can't work because there is no way to control inflation"}
{"prompt": "Inflation is simply a rise of prices over time, which is generally the result of the devaluing of a currency. This is a function of supply and demand. Given the fact that the supply of bitcoins is fixed at a certain amount, unlike fiat money, the only way for inflation to get out of control is for demand to disappear. Temporary inflation is possible with a rapid adoption of Fractional Reserve Banking but will stabilize once a substantial number of the 21 million \"hard\" bitcoins are stored as reserves by banks.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Given the fact that Bitcoin is a distributed system of currency, if demand were to decrease to almost nothing, the currency would be doomed anyway."}
{"prompt": "The key point here is that Bitcoin as a currency can't be inflated by any single person or entity, like a government, as there's no way to increase supply past a certain amount.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Indeed, the most likely scenario, as Bitcoin becomes more popular and demand increases, is for the currency to increase in value, or deflate, until demand stabilizes."}
{"prompt": "The Bitcoin community consists of anarchist/conspiracy theorist/gold standard 'weenies'\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The members of the community vary in their ideological stances. While it may have been started by ideological enthusiasts, Bitcoin now speaks to a large number of regular pragmatic folks, who simply see its potential for reducing the costs and friction of global e-commerce."}

{"prompt": "That said, as the network grows, it becomes harder and harder for a single entity to do so. Already the Bitcoin network's computing power is quite ahead of the world's fastest supercomputers, together.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What an attacker can do once the network is taken over is quite limited. Under no circumstances could an attacker create counterfeit coins, fake transactions, or take anybody else's money. An attacker's capabilities are limited to taking back their own money that they very recently spent, and preventing other people's transactions from receiving confirmations. Such an attack would be very costly in resources, and for such meager benefits there is little rational economic incentive to do such a thing."}
{"prompt": "Furthermore, this attack scenario would only be feasible for as long as it was actively underway. As soon as the attack stopped, the network would resume normal operation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin violates governmental regulations"}

{"prompt": "After 21 million coins are mined, no one will generate new blocks\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When operating costs can't be covered by the block creation bounty, which will happen some time before the total amount of BTC is reached, miners will earn some profit from transaction fees. However unlike the block reward, there is no coupling between transaction fees and the need for security, so there is less of a guarantee that the amount of mining being performed will be sufficient to maintain the network's security."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin has no built-in chargeback mechanism and this is bad\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin base-layer transactions are final and irreversible by design, but consumer protection can still built into bitcoin in other layers on top. The most practical way of doing this is multisig escrow. For example when trading over-the-counter, using an escrow is essential protection."}
{"prompt": "It's worth noting that virtually all successful consumer-facing bitcoin businesses do indeed already implement some kind of consumer protection; Routine escrow was used by Localbitcoins, Silk Road and the bitcoin ebay-site Bitmit. Others such as online bitcoin casinos rely on their long-standing reputation, while others such as Coinbase.com rely on the legal and regulatory system.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The bitcoin method of routinely using escrow has benefits over competitors like credit cards. The security of credit cards is not very good which results in higher costs overall and the possibility of payments being reversed for months afterwards. By contrast when bitcoins have been released to the seller from escrow, they cannot be reversed as the coins are truly in the seller's possession. The requirement to use real-life names for credit cards and PayPal also excludes unbanked people and those from countries with less developed financial infrastructure. There are also downsides like bitcoin is not yet as widely accepted as credit cards and is not a front for providing lines of credit."}
{"prompt": "Quantum computers would break Bitcoin's security\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography. Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat (cf. Aggarwal et al. 2017, \"Quantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them\").\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " See the implications of quantum computers on public key cryptography."}

{"prompt": "No more so than the wastefulness of mining gold out of the ground, melting it down and shaping it into bars, and then putting it back underground again. Not to mention the building of big fancy buildings, the waste of energy printing and minting all the various fiat currencies, the transportation thereof in armored cars by no less than two security guards for each who could probably be doing something more productive, etc.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As far as mediums of exchange go, Bitcoin is actually quite economical of resources, compared to others."}
{"prompt": "For example, Iceland produces an excess of cheap electricity from renewable sources, but it has no way of exporting electricity because of its remote location. It is conceivable that at some point in future Bitcoin mining will only be profitable in places like Iceland, and unprofitable in places like central Europe, where electricity comes mostly from nuclear and fossil sources.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Market forces could even push mining into innovative solutions that have an effective electricity consumption of zero. Mining always produces heat equivalent to the energy consumed - for example, 1000 watts of mining equipment produces the same amount of heat as a 1000 watt heating element used in an electric space heater, hot tub, water heater, or similar appliance. Someone already in a willing position to incur the cost of electricity for its heat value alone could run mining equipment specially designed to mine bitcoins while capturing and utilizing the heat produced, without incurring any energy costs beyond what they already intended to spend on heating."}
{"prompt": "When the environmental costs of mining are considered, they need to be weighed up against the benefits. If you question Bitcoin on the grounds that it consumes electricity, then you should also ask questions like this: Will Bitcoin promote economic growth by freeing up trade? Will this speed up the rate of technological innovation? Will this lead to faster development of green technologies? Will Bitcoin enable new, border crossing smart grid technologies? \u2026\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Dismissal of Bitcoin because of its costs, while ignoring its benefits, is a dishonest argument. In fact, any environmental argument of this type is dishonest, not just pertaining to Bitcoin. Along similar lines, it could be argued that wind turbines are bad for the environment because making the steel structure consumes energy."}

That device consumes about $40 per year in electricity (using U.S. residential average of about $0.15 per kWh.) But the device costs over $300 including shipping. Thus, just about a quarter of all costs over a two-year useful life goes to electricity. This compares to GPUs where more than 90% of costs over a two-year life went to electricity. Even more efficient designs can be expected in the future."}
{"prompt": "Shopkeepers can't seriously set prices in bitcoins because of the volatile exchange rate\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The assumption is that bitcoins must be sold immediately to cover operating expenses. If the shopkeeper's back-end expenses were transacted in bitcoins as well, then the exchange rate would be irrelevant. Larger adoption of Bitcoin would make prices sticky. Future volatility is expected to decrease, as the size and depth of the market grows."}
{"prompt": "In the meantime, many merchants simply regularly pull the latest market rates from the exchanges and automatically update the prices on their websites. Also you might be able to buy a put option in order to sell at a fixed rate for a given amount of time. This would protect you from drops in price and simplify your operations for that time period.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Like Flooz and e-gold, bitcoins serve as opportunities for criminals and will be shut down"}

{"prompt": "Bitcoins will be shut down by the government just like Liberty Dollars were\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Liberty Dollars started as a commercial venture to establish an alternative US currency, including physical banknotes and coins, backed by precious metals. This, in and of itself, is not illegal. They were prosecuted under counterfeiting laws because the silver coins allegedly resembled US currency."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoins do not resemble the currency of the US or of any other nation in any way, shape, or form. The word \"dollar\" is not attached to them in any way. The \"$\" symbol is not used in any way.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoins have no representational similarity whatsoever to US dollars."}
{"prompt": "Of course, actually 'shutting down' Liberty Dollars was as easy as arresting the head of the company and seizing the offices and the precious metals used as backing. The decentralized Bitcoin, with no leader, no servers, no office, and no tangible asset backing, does not have the same vulnerability.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin is not decentralized because the developers can dictate the software's behavior"}
{"prompt": "The Bitcoin protocol was originally defined by Bitcoin's inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto, and this protocol has now been widely accepted as the standard by the community of miners and users.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Though the developers of the original Bitcoin client still exert influence over the Bitcoin community, their power to arbitrarily modify the protocol is very limited. Since the release of Bitcoin v0.3, changes to the protocol have been minor and always in agreement with community consensus."}
{"prompt": "Protocol modifications, such as increasing the block award from 25 to 50 BTC, are not compatible with clients already running in the network. If the developers were to release a new client that the majority of miners perceives as corrupt, or in violation of the project\u2019s aims, that client would simply not catch on, and the few users who do try to use it would find that their transactions get rejected by the network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There are also other Bitcoin clients made by other developers that adhere to the Bitcoin protocol. As more developers create alternative clients, less power will lie with the developers of the original Bitcoin client."}
{"prompt": "It is safe to say that the currency itself has never been 'hacked'. However, several major websites using the currency have been hacked, often resulting in high profile Bitcoin heists. These heists are misreported in some media as hacks on Bitcoin itself. An analogy: just because someone stole US dollars from a supermarket till, doesn\u2019t mean that the US dollar as a currency has been 'hacked'.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Most bitcoin thefts are the result of inadequate wallet security. In response to the wave of thefts in 2011 and 2012, the community has developed risk-mitigating measures such as wallet encryption, support for multiple signatures, offline wallets, paper wallets, and hardware wallets.

{"prompt": "As bitcoin is a digital asset, it can be very un-intuitive to store safely. Historically many people have lost their coins but with proper understanding the risks can be eliminated. If your bitcoins do end up lost or stolen then there's almost certainly nothing that can be done to get them back.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " tl;dr The best way to store bitcoin is to either use a hardware wallet, a multi-signature wallet or a cold storage wallet. Have your wallet create a seed phrase, write it down on paper and store it in a safe place (or several safe places, as backups). Ideally the wallet should be backed by your own full node."}
{"prompt": "The key to protecting yourself from data loss of any kind is to have redundant backups so that if one is lost or destroyed, you still have others you can use when you need them. All good wallet software asks their users to write down the seed recovery phrase of the wallet as a backup, so that if your primary wallet is lost or damaged, you can use the seed recovery phrase to restore access to your coins. If you have more than one backup location, they should be in places where various disasters won't affect both of your backups. For example, its much better to store two backups in a home safe and in a safe deposit box (as long as your seed is protected by a passphrase) than to store two backups in your bedroom and one in your garage.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Also important is regularly verifying that your backup still exists and is in good condition. This can be as simple as ensuring your backups are still where you put them a couple times a year."}
{"prompt": "Storing a seed phrase only stores private keys, but it cannot tell you if or how many bitcoins you have actually received. For that you need wallet software.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you received cash banknotes or gold coins as payment, you wouldn't accept them without inspecting them and verifying that they are genuine. The same is true with bitcoin. Wallet software can automatically verify that a payment has been made and when that payment has been completed (by being mined into a number of blocks). The most secure kind of wallet is one which independently verifies all the rules of bitcoin, known as a full node. When receiving large volumes, it is essential to use wallet software that connects to a full node you run yourself. If bitcoin is digital gold, then a full node is your own personal digital goldsmith who checks that received bitcoin payments are actually real. Lightweight wallets have a number of security downsides because they don't check all of bitcoin's rules, and so should only be used for receiving smaller amounts or when you trust the sender. See the article about full nodes."}
{"prompt": "Your wallet software will also need to learn the history and balance of its wallet. For a lightweight wallet this usually involves querying a third-party server which leads to a privacy problem as that server can spy on you by seeing your entire balance, all your transactions and usually linking it with your IP address. Using a full node avoids this problem because the software connects directly to the bitcoin p2p network and downloads the entire blockchain, so any adversary will find it much harder to obtain information. See also: Anonymity\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " So for verification and privacy, a good storage solution should be backed by a full node under your own control for use when receiving payments. The full node wallet on an online computer can be a watch-only wallet. This means that it can detect transaction involving addresses belonging to the user and can display transaction information about them, but still does not have the ability to actually spend the bitcoins."}
{"prompt": "Anybody else who discovers a wallet's seed phrase can steal all the bitcoins if the seed isn't also protected by a secret passphrase. Even when using a passphrase, a seed should be kept safe and secret like jewels or cash. For example, no part of a seed should ever be typed into any website, and no one should store a seed on an internet-connected computer unless they are an advanced user who has researched what they're doing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Seed phrases can store any amount of bitcoins. It doesn't seem secure to possibly have enough money to purchase the entire building just sitting on a sheet of paper without any protection. For this reason many wallets make it possible to encrypt a seed phrase with a passphrase. See Seed phrase#Two-Factor_Seed_Phrases"}
{"prompt": "A hardware wallet holds the seed in its internal storage and is typically designed to be resistant to both physical and digital attacks. The device signs the transactions internally and only transmits the signed transactions to the computer, never communicating any secret data to the devices it connects to. The separation of the private keys from the vulnerable environment allows the user to spend bitcoins without running any risk even when using an untrustworthy computer. Hardware wallets are relatively user-friendly and are one of the best ways to store bitcoins.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some downsides are that hardware wallets are recognizable physical objects which could be discovered and which give away that you probably own bitcoins. This is worth considering when for example crossing borders. They also cost more than software wallets. Still, physical access to a hardware wallet does not mean that the keys are easily compromised, even though it does make it easier to compromise the hardware wallet. The groups that have created the most popular hardware wallets have gone to great lengths to harden the devices to physical threats and, though not impossible, only technically skilled people with specialized equipment have been able to get access to the private keys without the owner's consent. However, physically-powerful people such as armed border guards upon seeing the hardware wallet could force you to type in the PIN number to unlock the device and steal the bitcoins."}
{"prompt": "A multi-signature wallet is one where multiple private keys are required to move the bitcoins instead of a single key. Such a wallet can be used for requiring agreement among multiple people to spend, can eliminate a single point of failure, and can be used as form of backup, among other applications.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " These private keys can be spread across multiple machines in various locations with the rationale that malware and hackers are unlikely to infect all of them. The multisig wallet can be of the m-of-n type where any m private keys out of a possible n are required to move the money. For example a 2-of-3 multisig wallet might have your private keys spread across a desktop, laptop, and smartphone, any two of which are required to move the money, but the compromise or total loss of any one key does not result in loss of money, even if that key has no backups."}
{"prompt": "Multi-signature wallets have the advantage of being cheaper than hardware wallets since they are implemented in software and can be downloaded for free, and can be nearly as convenient since all keys are online and the wallet user interfaces are typically easy to use.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Hardware and multi-signature wallets can be combined by having a multi-signature wallet with the private keys held on hardware wallets; after all a single hardware wallet is still a single point of failure. Cold storage and multi-signature can also be combined, by having the multi-signature wallet with the private keys held in cold storage to avoid them being kept online."}
{"prompt": "A cold wallet generates and stores private wallet keys offline on a clean, newly-installed air-gapped computer. Payments are received online with a watch-only wallet. Unsigned transactions are generated online, transferred offline for signing, and the signed transaction is transferred online to be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This allows funds to be managed offline in Cold storage. Used correctly a cold wallet is protected against online threats, such as viruses and hackers. Cold wallets are similar to hardware wallets, except that a general purpose computing device is used instead of a special purpose peripheral. The downside is that the transferring of transactions to and fro can be fiddly and unweilding, and less practical for carrying around like a hardware wallet."}
{"prompt": "A hot wallet refers to keeping single-signature wallets with private keys kept on an online computer or mobile phone. Most bitcoin wallet software out there is a hot wallet. The bitcoins are easy to spend but are maximally vulnerable to malware or hackers. Hot wallets may be appropriate for small amounts and day-to-day spending.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A user might have a spending account hot wallet for day-to-day convenient spending with the majority of their funds on a savings account which is stored with much more security (cold storage / hardware wallet / multi-signature)."}
{"prompt": "Custodial wallets are where an exchange, broker or other third party holds your bitcoins in trust.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The number one rule to storing bitcoin is this: if you don\u2019t hold the private keys, you don\u2019t actually own the assets. There are many historical examples of loss due to custodial wallets: Bitcoinica, Silk Road, Bitfloor, MTGOX, Sheep Marketplace, BTC-e, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Bithumb, Cryptsy, Bter, Mintpal and many more[1]"}

Suppose one day they wake up and decide to be evil and move all the Bitcoin to some private account of theirs, and perhaps make up a story in the press about how they've been \"hacked\". You have a serious problem, as you might find there is a protracted legal battle (see MtGox), but you can't actually retrieve the funds unless in some way the company is re-stocked with Bitcoin, or perhaps an equivalent in fiat."}
{"prompt": "If on the other hand you controlled the funds with a majority of keys in a multisig i.e. you own both of the two needed keys of a 2-of-3 multisig, then it would always effectively be your bitcoin, even though the third key may belong to a trusted third party custodian. But this also comes with the responsibility that if you get hacked, you lose all your funds. That is why it's prudent, in a 2-of-3 multisig where you have the two needed keys, to have them in separate systems/locations. If one of them fails, you can go to the custodian to supply the third key and transfer your funds again to safety. But the custodian alone, cannot touch your funds just by virtue of having the third key.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Now, if your bank gets hacked similarly - 5 key operatives in the bank decide to swipe your money and pretend it was external hackers - SWIFT transfers are made to accounts in Russia and China. Here it will always ultimately be at the discretion of legal agencies whether you \"actually\" still have the money that is stolen. Because dollars are not real, they can be created at a whim[3], and while reversing international transfers is not quite so simple, very often that reversal can be achieved (e.g. recent SWIFT hack at bangladesh[4][5] bank; $1 billion stolen, all but $80 million \"recovered\" (just means wire transfers reversed)). Added to that consider that fiat money is insured, so even when transfers can't be reversed, the money can be \"recovered\". If too many banks get hacked all at once the Federal Reserve and the government together can make up some \"fund\" that magically reassigns balances any time they like, with sufficient political will (that's essentially what was happening in 2008 TARP etc)."}
{"prompt": "So far no insurance company has ever paid out on a Bitcoin company's claim. Worth considering also.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You might say, since it's risky both ways, why not trust Coinbase? Aren't they more competent in security than me?"}
{"prompt": "Web wallets have all the downsides of custodial wallets (no direct possession, private keys are held by a third party) along with all the downsides of hot wallets (exposed private keys), as well as all the downsides of lightweight wallets (not verifying bitcoin's rules, someone could send you a billion bitcoins and under certain conditions the dumb web wallet would happily accept it)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Someone who needs the easy access of a web wallet should download a lightweight wallet like Electrum."}
{"prompt": "So-called paper wallets are an obsolete and unsafe method of storing bitcoin which should not be recommended to beginners. They simply store a single private/public keypair on paper. They promote address reuse and require unwieldy and complicated live OS system boots to be safe, they risk theft by printers, and typically rely on Javascript cryptography.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Paper wallets also do not provide any method of displaying to the user when money has arrived. There's no practical way to use a full node wallet. Users are typically driven to use third-party blockchain explorers which can lie to them and spy on them."}
{"prompt": "An interesting unconventional solution. The idea is to use time-lock contracts to create a wallet which cannot be spent from until a certain date. One possible use-case might be by a gambling addict who locks up money for paying bills for a month, after a month has passed and their time-lock wallet is opened they use that money for paying bills instead of gambling. This is the equivalent proposal towards compulsive shoppers to freeze their credit card in a block of ice, so when they feel the urge to immediately buy something they see on the TV, they will need to wait for the block to melt until they can retrieve the credit card to be able to place the order. This hopefully gives them the time to cool off, and reconsider an otherwise meaningless purchase.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Time lock wallets don't exist yet except for simple javascript pages which rely on Javascript cryptography and are therefore not safe."}
{"prompt": "There are multiple ways that can be utilized to beat this attack: by hiding, by defending yourself, by not letting others know your Bitcoin wealth or holdings, or by implementing security procedures which would prevent you from being able to surrender funds in such an attack, thereby reducing the appeal for an attacker to perform such an attack in the first place.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stored bitcoins are not secured by seed phrases, hardware wallets, multi-signature, passwords, hash functions or anything like that; they are secured by people."}
{"prompt": "Technology is never the root of system security. Technology is a tool to help people secure what they value. Security requires people to act. A server cannot be secured by a firewall if there is no lock on the door to the server room, and a lock cannot secure the server room without a guard to monitor the door, and a guard cannot secure the door without risk of personal harm.[7].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin is no different. The technology discussed on this page is only a tool to tip the scales in the defender's favour. Following from this principle, the way to beat the $5 wrench attack is to bear arms. Either your own, or employ guards, or use a safety deposit box, or rely on the police forces and army; or whatever may be appropriate and proportionate in your situation. If someone physically overpowers you then no technology on Earth can save your bitcoins. You can't be your own bank without bank-level security."}

Such schemes are usually pyramid/matrix-style schemes that make money from their own employees and offer nothing of any real value. Most convince one to buy packages that will make them earn hundreds a day, which in fact have the buyer distribute more such ads, and make minute profits.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin is in no way similar to these schemes. Bitcoin doesn't promise windfall profits. There is no way for the developers to make money from your involvement or to take money from you. That bitcoins are nearly impossible to acquire without the owner's consent represents one of its greatest strengths. Bitcoin is an experimental, virtual currency that may succeed or may fail.

A small minority of people with dedicated, high-performance hardware do earn some Bitcoins by \"mining\" (generating new bitcoins, see What is mining?) with special software, but joining Bitcoin shouldn't be construed as being the road to riches. Most Bitcoin users get involved because they find the project conceptually interesting and don't earn anything by doing so. This is also why you won't find much speculation about the political or economic repercussions of Bitcoin anywhere on this site: Bitcoin developers owe their dedication to the project's intellectual yieldings more than to those of a monetary nature.

This is due to repeated cases where someone pays for bitcoins with Paypal, receives their bitcoins, and then fraudulently complains to Paypal that they never received their purchase. PayPal often sides with the fraudulent buyer in this case, which means any seller needs to cover that risk with higher fees or refuse to accept PayPal altogether."}

{"prompt": "New bitcoins are generated by the network through the process of \"mining\". In a process that is similar to a continuous raffle draw, mining nodes on the network are awarded bitcoins each time they find the solution to a certain mathematical problem (and thereby create a new block). Creating a block is a proof of work with a difficulty that varies with the overall strength of the network. The reward for solving a block is automatically adjusted so that, ideally, every four years of operation of the Bitcoin network, half the amount of bitcoins created in the prior 4 years are created. A maximum of 10,499,889.80231183 bitcoins were created in the first 4 (approx.) years from January 2009 to November 2012. Every four years thereafter this amount halves, so it should be 5,250,000 over years 4-8, 2,625,000 over years 8-12, and so on. Thus the total number of bitcoins in existence can never exceed 20,999,839.77085749 and counting. See Controlled Currency Supply.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Blocks are mined every 10 minutes, on average and for the first four years (210,000 blocks) each block included 50 new bitcoins. As the amount of processing power directed at mining changes, the difficulty of creating new bitcoins changes. This difficulty factor is calculated every 2016 blocks and is based upon the time taken to generate the previous 2016 blocks. See Mining."}
{"prompt": "What's the current total number of bitcoins in existence?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Current count. Also see Total bitcoins in circulation chart"}
{"prompt": "A bitcoin can be divided down to 8 decimal places. Therefore, 0.00000001 BTC is the smallest amount that can be handled in a transaction. If necessary, the protocol and related software can be modified to handle even smaller amounts.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What do I call the various denominations of bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Unlike most currencies, Bitcoin amounts are highly divisible. This has led to a desire to create names for smaller denominations of bitcoin amounts, especially since transactions involving whole bitcoins are no longer quite so common. Bitcoin is decentralized, so there is no organization that can set official names for units. Therefore, there are many different units with varying degrees of popularity. As of 2014, the most common units are bitcoins, bits, and satoshi: 1 bitcoin = 1\u2009000\u2009000.00 bits = 100\u2009000\u2009000 satoshi.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The bitcoin (abbreviated BTC or XBT) is the unit that was used in the original Bitcoin wallet software created by Satoshi Nakamoto. There is nothing particularly special about this unit, but it is by far the most common unit due to tradition."}
{"prompt": "The smallest value that the Bitcoin network supports sending is the satoshi (sometimes abbreviated sat), one hundred-millionth (0.000\u2009000\u200901) of a bitcoin. In other words, the network does not support sending fractions of a satoshi. Since it is a hard limit, it seems natural to use it as a unit, though it currently has very little value. The unit was named in honor of Bitcoin's creator after he left -- he was not so vain as to name a unit after himself. The plural of satoshi is satoshi: \"Send me 100 satoshi\".\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Another common unit is the bit, one millionth (0.000\u2009001) of a bitcoin. This unit is the same as a microbitcoin (\u03bcBTC). Bits are seen by some as especially logical because they have two-decimal precision like most fiat currencies. You can send 1.23 bits, but not 1.234 bits due to the network's limited precision."}

{"prompt": "How does the halving work when the number gets really small?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Eventually the reward will go from 0.00000001 BTC to zero and no more bitcoins will be created."}
{"prompt": "The block reward calculation is done as a right bitwise shift of a 64-bit signed integer, which means it is divided by two and rounded down. The integer is equal to the value in BTC * 100,000,000 since internally in the reference client software, all Bitcoin balances and values are stored as unsigned integers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " With an initial block reward of 50 BTC, it will take many 4-year periods for the block reward to reach zero."}
{"prompt": "How long will it take to generate all the coins?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The last block that will generate coins will be block #6,929,999 which should be generated at or near the year 2140. The total number of coins in circulation will then remain static at 20,999,999.9769 BTC."}
{"prompt": "Even if the allowed precision is expanded from the current 8 decimals, the total BTC in circulation will always be slightly below 21 million (assuming everything else stays the same). For example, with 16 decimals of precision, the end total would be 20,999,999.999999999496 BTC.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If no more coins are going to be generated, will more blocks be created?"}
{"prompt": "Absolutely! Even before the creation of coins ends, the use of transaction fees will likely make creating new blocks more valuable from the fees than the new coins being created. When coin generation ends, these fees will sustain the ability to use bitcoins and the Bitcoin network. There is no practical limit on the number of blocks that will be mined in the future.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " But if no more coins are generated, what happens when Bitcoins are lost? Won't that be a problem?"}
{"prompt": "Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer bitcoins are available the ones that are left will be in higher demand, and therefore will have a higher value. So, as Bitcoins are lost, the remaining bitcoins will eventually increase in value to compensate. As the value of a bitcoin increases, the number of bitcoins required to purchase an item decreases. This is a deflationary economic model. As the average transaction size reduces, transactions will probably be denominated in sub-units of a bitcoin such as millibitcoins (\"Millies\") or microbitcoins (\"Mikes\").\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Bitcoin protocol uses a base unit of one hundred-millionth of a Bitcoin (\"a Satoshi\"), but unused bits are available in the protocol fields that could be used to denote even smaller subdivisions."}
{"prompt": "If every transaction is broadcast via the network, does Bitcoin scale?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The blockchain base layer is not very scalable but layer-2 technologies can be used to greatly increase bitcoin's scale. Lightning Network is one example which uses smart contracts to build a network where payments are routed along a path instead of flooded to every peer. These payments can be nearly as secure and irreversible as blockchain transactions but have much better scalability (as well support instant payments which are much more private). Other possible layer-2 scalability technologies are sidechains or a bitcoin ecash chaumian bank."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoins have value because they are useful and because they are scarce. As they are accepted by more merchants, their value will stabilize. See the list of Bitcoin-accepting sites.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When we say that a currency is backed up by gold, we mean that there's a promise in place that you can exchange the currency for gold. Bitcoins, like dollars and euros, are not backed up by anything except the variety of merchants that accept them."}
{"prompt": "It's a common misconception that Bitcoins gain their value from the cost of electricity required to generate them. Cost doesn't equal value \u2013 hiring 1,000 men to shovel a big hole in the ground may be costly, but not valuable. Also, even though scarcity is a critical requirement for a useful currency, it alone doesn't make anything valuable. For example, your fingerprints are scarce, but that doesn't mean they have any exchange value.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Alternatively it needs to be added that while the law of supply and demand applies it does not guarantee value of Bitcoins in the future. If confidence in Bitcoins is lost then it will not matter that the supply can no longer be increased, the demand will fall off with all holders trying to get rid of their coins. An example of this can be seen in cases of state currencies, in cases when the state in question dissolves and so no new supply of the currency is available (the central authority managing the supply is gone), however the demand for the currency falls sharply because confidence in its purchasing power disappears. Of-course Bitcoins do not have such central authority managing the supply of the coins, but it does not prevent confidence from eroding due to other situations that are not necessarily predictable."}
{"prompt": "A ponzi scheme is a zero sum game. Early adopters can only profit at the expense of late adopters. Bitcoin has possible win-win outcomes. Early adopters profit from the rise in value. Late adopters, and indeed, society as a whole, benefit from the usefulness of a stable, fast, inexpensive, and widely accepted p2p currency.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The fact that early adopters benefit more doesn't alone make anything a Ponzi scheme. All good investments in successful companies have this quality."}
{"prompt": "Doesn't Bitcoin unfairly benefit early adopters?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Early adopters in Bitcoin are taking a risk and invested resources in an unproven technology. By so doing, they help Bitcoin become what it is now and what it will be in the future (hopefully, a ubiquitous decentralized digital currency). It is only fair they will reap the benefits of their successful investment."}
{"prompt": "In any case, any bitcoin generated will probably change hands dozens of time as a medium of exchange, so the profit made from the initial distribution will be insignificant compared to the total commerce enabled by Bitcoin. Many of the earliest users of Bitcoin have traded their coins at valuations below $1 US, or other amounts which are small compared to contemporary prices.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Won't loss of wallets and the finite amount of Bitcoins create excessive deflation, destroying Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Worries about Bitcoin being destroyed by deflation are not entirely unfounded. Unlike most currencies, which experience inflation as their founding institutions create more and more units, Bitcoin will likely experience gradual deflation with the passage of time. Bitcoin is unique in that only a small amount of units will ever be produced (twenty-one million to be exact), this number has been known since the project's inception, and the units are created at a predictable rate.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Also, Bitcoin users are faced with a danger that doesn't threaten users of any other currency: if a Bitcoin user loses his wallet, his money is gone forever, unless he finds it again. And not just to him; it's gone completely out of circulation, rendered utterly inaccessible to anyone. As people will lose their wallets, the total number of Bitcoins will slowly decrease."}
{"prompt": "Therefore, Bitcoin seems to be faced with a unique problem. Whereas most currencies inflate over time, Bitcoin will mostly likely do just the opposite. Time will see the irretrievable loss of an ever-increasing number of Bitcoins. An already small number will be permanently whittled down further and further. And as there become fewer and fewer Bitcoins, the laws of supply and demand suggest that their value will probably continually rise.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Thus Bitcoin is bound to once again stray into mysterious territory, because no one exactly knows what happens to a currency that grows continually more valuable. Many economists claim that a low level of inflation is a good thing for a currency, but nobody is quite sure about what might happens to one that continually deflates. Although deflation could hardly be called a rare phenomenon, steady, constant deflation is unheard of. There may be a lot of speculation, but no one has any hard data to back up their claims."}
{"prompt": "That being said, there is a mechanism in place to combat the obvious consequences. Extreme deflation would render most currencies highly impractical: if a single Canadian dollar could suddenly buy the holder a car, how would one go about buying bread or candy? Even pennies would fetch more than a person could carry. Bitcoin, however, offers a simple and stylish solution: infinite divisibility. Bitcoins can be divided up and trade into as small of pieces as one wants, so no matter how valuable Bitcoins become, one can trade them in practical quantities.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In fact, infinite divisibility should allow Bitcoins to function in cases of extreme wallet loss. Even if, in the far future, so many people have lost their wallets that only a single Bitcoin, or a fraction of one, remains, Bitcoin should continue to function just fine. No one can claim to be sure what is going to happen, but deflation may prove to present a smaller threat than many expect."}
{"prompt": "For more information, see the Deflationary spiral page.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What if someone bought up all the existing Bitcoins?"}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin markets are competitive -- meaning the price of a bitcoin will rise or fall depending on supply and demand at certain price levels. Only a fraction of bitcoins issued to date are found on the exchange markets for sale. So even though technically, a buyer with lots of money could buy all the bitcoins offered for sale, unless those holding the rest of the bitcoins offer them for sale as well, even the wealthiest, most determined buyer can't get at them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Additionally, new currency continues to be issued daily and will continue to do so for decades; though over time the rate at which they are issued declines to insignificant levels. Those who are mining aren't obligated to sell their bitcoins so not all bitcoins will make it to the markets even."}
{"prompt": "This situation doesn't suggest, however, that the markets aren't vulnerable to price manipulation. It doesn't take significant amounts of money to move the market price up or down, and thus Bitcoin remains a volatile asset.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What if someone creates a new block chain, or a new digital currency that renders Bitcoin obsolete?"}
{"prompt": "That the block chain cannot be easily forked represents one of the central security mechanisms of Bitcoin. Given the choice between two block chains, a Bitcoin miner always chooses the longer one - that is to say, the one with the more complex hash. Thusly, it ensures that each user can only spend their bitcoins once, and that no user gets ripped off.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As a consequence of the block chain structure, there may at any time be many different sub-branches, and the possibility always exists of a transaction being over-written by the longest branch, if it has been recorded in a shorter one. The older a transaction is though, the lower its chances of being over-written, and the higher of becoming permanent. Although the block chain prevents one from spending more Bitcoins than one has, it means that transactions can be accidentally nullified."}
{"prompt": "A new block chain would leave the network vulnerable to double-spend attacks. However, the creation of a viable new chain presents considerable difficulty, and the possibility does not present much of a risk.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin will always choose the longer Block Chain and determines the relative length of two branches by the complexities of their hashes. Since the hash of each new block is made from that of the block preceding it, to create a block with a more complex hash, one must be prepared to do more computation than has been done by the entire Bitcoin network from the fork point up to the newest of the blocks one is trying to supersede. Needless to say, such an undertaking would require a very large amount of processing power and since Bitcoin is continually growing and expanding, it will likely only require more with the passage of time."}
{"prompt": "A much more distinct and real threat to the Bitcoin use is the development of other, superior virtual currencies, which could supplant Bitcoin and render it obsolete and valueless.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A great deal of careful thought and ingenuity has gone into the development of Bitcoin, but it is the first of its breed, a prototype, and vulnerable to more highly-evolved competitors. At present, any threatening rivals have yet to rear their heads; Bitcoin remains the first and foremost private virtual currency, but we can offer no guarantees that it will retain that position. It would certainly be in keeping with internet history for a similar system built from the same principles to supersede and cast Bitcoin into obsolescence, after time had revealed its major shortcomings. Friendster and Myspace suffered similar fates at the hand of Facebook, Napster was ousted by Limeware, Bearshare and torrent applications, and Skype has all but crushed the last few disciples of the Microsoft Messenger army."}
{"prompt": "The current low market cap of Bitcoin means that any investor with deep enough pockets can significantly change/manipulate the rate. Is this a problem?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This is only a problem if you are investing in Bitcoin for short period of time. A manipulator can't change the fundamentals, and over a period of 5-10 years, the fundamentals will win over any short term manipulations."}
{"prompt": "10 minutes is the average time taken to find a block. It can be significantly more or less time than that depending on luck; 10 minutes is simply the average case.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Blocks (shown as \"confirmations\" in the GUI) are how the Bitcoin achieves consensus on who owns what. Once a block is found everyone agrees that you now own those coins, so you can spend them again. Until then it's possible that some network nodes believe otherwise, if somebody is attempting to defraud the system by reversing a transaction. The more confirmations a transaction has, the less risk there is of a reversal. Only 6 blocks or 1 hour is enough to make reversal computationally impractical. This is dramatically better than credit cards which can see chargebacks occur up to three months after the original transaction!"}
{"prompt": "Ten minutes was specifically chosen by Satoshi as a tradeoff between first confirmation time and the amount of work wasted due to chain splits. After a block is mined, it takes time for other miners to find out about it, and until then they are actually competing against the new block instead of adding to it. If someone mines another new block based on the old block chain, the network can only accept one of the two, and all the work that went into the other block gets wasted. For example, if it takes miners 1 minute on average to learn about new blocks, and new blocks come every 10 minutes, then the overall network is wasting about 10% of its work. Lengthening the time between blocks reduces this waste.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As a thought experiment, what if the Bitcoin network grew to include Mars? From the farthest points in their orbits, it takes about 20 minutes for a signal to travel from Earth to Mars. With only 10 minutes between new blocks, miners on Mars would always be 2 blocks behind the miners on Earth. It would be almost impossible for them to contribute to the block chain. If we wanted collaborate with those kinds of delays, we would need at least a few hours between new blocks."}
{"prompt": "Do you have to wait until my transactions are confirmed in order to buy or sell things with Bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " YES, you do, IF the transaction is non-recourse. The Bitcoin reference software does not display transactions as confirmed until six blocks have passed (confirmations). As transactions are buried in the chain they become increasingly non-reversible but are very reversible before the first confirmation. Two to six confirmations are recommended for non-recourse situations depending on the value of the transactions involved."}
{"prompt": "When people ask this question they are usually thinking about applications like supermarkets. This generally is a recourse situation: if somebody tries to double-spend on a face-to-face transaction it might work a few times, but probabalistically speaking eventually one of the double-spends will get noticed, and the penalty for shoplifting charges in most localities is calibrated to be several times worse than the proceeds of a single shoplifting event.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Double-spends might be a concern for something like a snack machine in a low-traffic area with no nearby security cameras. Such a machine shouldn't honor zero-confirmation payments, and should instead use some other mechanism of clearing Bitcoin or validating transactions against reversal, see the wiki article here for alternatives."}
{"prompt": "Applications that require immediate payment processing, like supermarkets or snack machines, need to manage the risks. Here is one way to reverse an unconfirmed payment:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A Finney attack is where an attacker mines a block containing a movement of some coins back to themselves. Once they find a block solution, they quickly go to a merchant and make a purchase, then broadcast the block, thus taking back the coins. This attack is a risk primarily for goods that are dispatched immediately, like song downloads or currency trades. Because the attacker can't choose the time of the attack, it isn't a risk for merchants such as supermarkets where you can't choose exactly when to pay (due to queues, etc). The attack can fail if somebody else finds a block containing the purchasing transaction before you release your own block, therefore, merchants can reduce but not eliminate the risk by making purchasers wait some length of time that's less than a confirm."}
{"prompt": "Because pulling off this attack is not trivial, merchants who need to sell things automatically and instantly are most likely to adjust the price to include the cost of reversal fraud, or elect to use special insurance.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " I was sent some bitcoins and they haven't arrived yet! Where are they?"}
{"prompt": "Don't panic! There are a number of reasons why your bitcoins might not show up yet, and a number of ways to diagnose them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The latest version of the Bitcoin-Qt client tells you how far it has yet to go in downloading the blockchain. Hover over the icon in the bottom right corner of the client to learn your client's status."}
{"prompt": "If it has not caught up then it's possible that your transaction hasn't been included in a block yet.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can check pending transactions in the network by going here or here and then searching for your address. If the transaction is listed here then it's a matter of waiting until it gets included in a block before it will show in your client."}
{"prompt": "I sent too small of a transaction fee, is my bitcoin lost forever?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If the transaction never gets confirmed into a block - the mempool expiry of all nodes will drop it eventually and you will be able to spend your funds again - typically it takes about 3 days or so for this to happen. If using an [SPV] wallet such as Electrum or Multibit, if after three days the wallet does not see the coin to spend, you need to reindex your wallet's block headers. After reindexing, your wallet will see that the coin was never confirmed and thus the balance will be spendable again."}
{"prompt": "NOTE: From Bitcoin 0.14 \u201ctransaction reappearance\u201d happens after 2 weeks.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Why does my Bitcoin address keep changing?"}
{"prompt": "While it is technically possible to use an address for an arbitrary number of payments, this works by accident and harms both yourself and other unrelated third parties, so it is considered a bad practice. The most important concerns with such misuse involve loss of privacy and security: both can be put into jeopardy when addresses are used for more than a single transaction only.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How much will the transaction fee be? / Why is the fee so high?"}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin transactions almost always require a transaction fee for them to get confirmed. The transaction fee is received by the first bitcoin miner who mines a block containing the transaction; this action is also what gives the transaction its first confirmation. The appropriate fee varies depending on how large (in bytes) your transaction is, how fast you want the transaction to be confirmed, and also on current network conditions. As such, paying a fixed fee, or even a fixed fee per kB, is a very bad idea; all good Bitcoin wallets will use several pieces of data to estimate an appropriate fee for you, though some are better at fee estimation than others.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The fee most strongly depends on the transaction's data size. Fees do not depend on the BTC amount of the transaction -- it's entirely possible for a 0.01 BTC transaction to require a higher fee than a 1000 BTC transaction."}
{"prompt": "Basic intro to how Bitcoin transactions work: If you receive BTC in three separate transactions of (say) 1, 5, and 10 BTC, then you can think of your wallet as containing three gold coins with sizes 1, 5, and 10 BTC. If you then want to send 6 BTC, you can melt the 1 & 5 BTC coins together and recast them as a 6 BTC coin, or melt the 10 BTC coin and recast a 6 BTC coin for the recipient and a 4 BTC coin as change for yourself. In Bitcoin's technical vocabulary, these objects are literally called input and output coins. (In the rest of this section, when we say \"coin\" we mean these objects, not the amount of BTC value.)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Transaction data sizes, and therefore fees, are proportional to the number (not value) of input and output coins in a transaction. Input coins are about 5x larger / more expensive than output coins."}
{"prompt": "If your wallet estimates a very high fee, it is most likely because your wallet is full of a whole bunch of tiny coins, so your transaction will need to take very many coins as inputs, increasing the cost. On the bright side, fees will go down once you make a few transactions, since you will end up \"melting down\" these many small coins into a few larger ones. Sometimes you can significantly reduce the fee by sending less BTC: if you have like 1000 tiny faucet payments totaling 0.5 BTC and then 16.5 BTC from other sources, then you'll find that sending ~16.5 BTC will be massively cheaper than sending a slightly higher value since it avoids including all of those faucet coins.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Fees also fluctuate depending on network conditions. All unconfirmed transactions compete with each other to be picked up by miners. If there are a lot of high-fee transactions being sent right now, then you will need to pay higher fees to out-bid them. On the other hand, if speed is less important to you, you can pay a somewhat smaller fee, and your transaction will float around until there is a period of reduced network usage. Sometimes even transactions with zero fee will be confirmed after a very long period of time, though this requires a perfect set of conditions, beyond what is explained here (ie. it probably won't work if you try it)."}
{"prompt": "Oftentimes wallets will have an \"express\" fee configuration, but note that confirmation times are naturally random and unreliable. At any given point in time, the probability that no transactions will be confirmed in the next hour is about 0.25% (ie. it happens more than once per week on average). Bitcoin users should avoid getting into situations where their transactions absolutely must get 1 confirmation in the next couple of hours, even if high-fee transactions usually take less than 10 minutes to get 1 confirmation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " What happens when someone sends me a bitcoin but my computer is powered off?"}
{"prompt": "Bitcoins are not actually \"sent\" to your wallet; the software only uses that term so that we can use the currency without having to learn new concepts. Your wallet is only needed when you wish to spend coins that you've received.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If you are sent coins when your wallet client program is not running, and you later launch the wallet client program, the coins will eventually appear as if they were just received in the wallet. That is to say, when the client program is started it must download blocks and catch up with any transactions it did not already know about."}
{"prompt": "How long does \"synchronizing\" take when the Bitcoin client is first installed? What's it doing?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The popular Bitcoin client software from bitcoin.org implements a \"full\" Bitcoin node: It can carry out all the duties of the Bitcoin P2P system, it isn't simply a \"client\". One of the principles behind the operation of full Bitcoin nodes is that they don't assume that the other participants have followed the rules of the Bitcoin system. During synchronization, the software is processing historical Bitcoin transactions and making sure for itself that all of the rules of the system have been correctly followed."}
{"prompt": "In normal operation, after synchronizing, the software should use a hardly noticeable amount of your computer's resources.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " When the wallet client program is first installed, its initial validation requires a lot of work from your computer's hard disk, so the amount of time to synchronize depends on your disk speed and, to a lesser extent, your CPU speed. It can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or so. On a slow computer it could take more than 40 hours of continuous synchronization, so check your computer's power-saving settings to ensure that it does not turn its hard disk off when unattended for a few hours. You can use the Bitcoin software during synchronization, but you may not see recent payments to you until the client program has caught up to the point where those transactions happened."}
{"prompt": "Do I need to configure my firewall to run Bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin will connect to other nodes, usually on TCP port 8333. You will need to allow outgoing TCP connections to port 8333 if you want to allow your Bitcoin client to connect to many nodes. Testnet uses TCP port 18333 instead of 8333."}
{"prompt": "If you want to restrict your firewall rules to a few IPs, you can find stable nodes in the fallback nodes list.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How does the peer finding mechanism work?"}
{"prompt": "Technically speaking, mining is the calculation of a hash of the a block header, which includes among other things a reference to the previous block, a hash of a set of transactions and a nonce. If the hash value is found to be less than the current target (which is inversely proportional to the difficulty), a new block is formed and the miner gets the newly generated Bitcoins (25 per block at current levels). If the hash is not less than the current target, a new nonce is tried, and a new hash is calculated. This is done millions of times per second by each miner.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Is mining used for some useful computation?"}
{"prompt": "Spending energy on creating and securing a free monetary system is hardly a waste. Also, services necessary for the operation of currently widespread monetary systems, such as banks and credit card companies, also spend energy, arguably more than Bitcoin would.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Why don't we use calculations that are also useful for some other purpose?"}
{"prompt": "To provide security for the Bitcoin network, the calculations involved need to have some very specific features. These features are incompatible with leveraging the computation for other purposes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How can we stop miners from creating zero transaction blocks?"}
{"prompt": "The incentive for miners to include transactions is in the fees that come along with them. If we were to implement some minimum number of transactions per block it would be trivial for a miner to create and include transactions merely to surpass that threshold. As the network matures, the block reward drops, and miners become more dependent on transactions fees to pay their costs, the problem of zero transaction blocks should diminish over time.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " How does the proof-of-work system help secure Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin uses the Hashcash proof of work with a minor adaption. To give a general idea of the mining process, imagine this setup:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": "  payload = <some data related to things happening on the Bitcoin network>"}
{"prompt": "The work performed by a miner consists of repeatedly increasing \"nonce\" until the hash function yields a value, that has the rare property of being below a certain target threshold. (In other words: The hash \"starts with a certain number of zeroes\", if you display it in the fixed-length representation, that is typically used.)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As can be seen, the mining process doesn't compute anything special. It merely tries to find a number (also referred to as nonce) which - in combination with the payload - results in a hash with special properties."}
{"prompt": "The advantage of using such a mechanism consists of the fact, that it is very easy to check a result: Given the payload and a specific nonce, only a single call of the hashing function is needed to verify that the hash has the required properties. Since there is no known way to find these hashes other than brute force, this can be used as a \"proof of work\" that someone invested a lot of computing power to find the correct nonce for this payload.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This feature is then used in the Bitcoin network to allow the network to come to a consensus on the history of transactions. An attacker that wants to rewrite history will need to do the required proof of work before it will be accepted. And as long as honest miners have more computing power, they can always outpace an attacker."}
{"prompt": "Also see Hashcash and Proof-of-work system and SHA2 and on Wikipedia.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Why was the \"Generate coin\" option of the client software removed?"}
{"prompt": "Could miners collude to give themselves money or to fundamentally change the nature of Bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There are two questions in here. Let's look at them separately."}
{"prompt": "Could miners gang up and give themselves money?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Mining itself is the process of creating new blocks in the block chain. Each block contains a list of all the transactions that have taken place across the entire Bitcoin network since the last block was created, as well as a hash of the previous block. New blocks are 'mined', or rather, generated, by Bitcoin clients correctly guessing sequences of characters in codes called 'hashes,' which are created using information from previous blocks. Bitcoin users may download specialized 'mining' software, which allows them to dedicate some amount of their processing power \u2013 however large or small \u2013 to guessing at strings within the hash of the previous block. Whoever makes the right guess first, thus creating a new block, receives a reward in Bitcoins."}
{"prompt": "The block chain is one of the two structures that makes Bitcoin secure, the other being the public-key encryption system on which Bitcoin trade is based. The block chain assures that not only is every single transaction that ever takes place recorded, but that every single transaction is recorded on the computer of anyone who chooses to store the relevant information. Many, many users have complete records of every transaction in Bitcoins history readily available to them at any point, and anyone who wants in the information can obtain it with ease. These things make Bitcoin very hard to fool.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The Bitcoin network takes considerable processing power to run, and since those with the most processing power can make the most guesses, those who put the most power toward to sustaining the network earn the most currency. Each correct guess yields, at present, twenty-five Bitcoins, and as Bitcoins are presently worth something (although the value still fluctuates) every miner who earns any number of Bitcoins makes money. Some miners pull in Bitcoins on their own; and some also join or form pools wherein all who contribute earn a share of the profits."}
{"prompt": "Can they do so in ways not sanctioned by Bitcoin network? Is there any way to rip off the network and make loads of money dishonestly?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin isn't infallible. It can be cheated, but doing so is extremely difficult. Bitcoin was designed to evade some of the central problems with modern currencies \u2013 namely, that their trustworthiness hinges upon that of people who might not have users' best interests in mind. Every currency in the world (other than Bitcoin) is controlled by large institutions who keep track of what's done with it, and who can manipulate its value. And every other currency has value because people trust the institutions that control them."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin doesn't ask that its users trust any institution. Its security is based on the cryptography that is an integral part of its structure, and that is readily available for any and all to see. Instead of one entity keeping track of transactions, the entire network does, so Bitcoins are astoundingly difficult to steal, or double-spend. Bitcoins are created in a regular and predictable fashion, and by many different users, so no one can decide to make a whole lot more and lessen their value. In short, Bitcoin is designed to be inflation-proof, double-spend-proof and completely distributed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nonetheless, there are a few ways that one can acquire Bitcoins dishonestly. Firstly, one can steal private keys. Key theft isn't something that Bitcoin security has been designed to prevent: it's up to users to keep their keys safe. But the cryptography is designed so that it is completely impossible to deduce someone's private key from their public one. As long as you keep your private key to yourself, you don't have much to worry about. Furthermore, one could theoretically create a new block chain, but due to the way in which the block chain is constructed, this would be extremely difficult and require massive amounts of processing power. A full explanation of the difficulties involved can be found in the block chain article."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin can be ripped off \u2013 but doing so would be extremely hard and require considerable expertise and a staggering amount of processing power. And it's only going to get harder with time. Bitcoin isn't impenetrable, but it's close enough to put any real worries in the peripherals.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Could miners fundamentally change the nature of Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "And thus, it is more or less impossible for anyone to change the function of Bitcoin to their advantage. If users don't like the changes, they won't adopt them, whereas if users do like them, then these will help everyone equally. Of course, one can conceive of a situation where someone manages to get a change pushed through that provides them with an advantage that no one notices, but given that Bitcoin is structurally relatively simple, it is unlikely that any major changes will go through without someone noticing first.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The fact that such changes are so difficult to make testifies to the fully distributed nature of Bitcoin. Any centrally controlled currency can be modified by its central agency without the consent of its adherents. Bitcoin has no central authority, so it changes only at the behest of the whole community. Bitcoins development represents a kind of collective evolution; the first of its kind among currencies."}

{"prompt": "While Bitcoin can support strong privacy, many ways of using it are usually not very private. With proper understanding of the technology, bitcoin can indeed be used in a very private and anonymous way.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As of 2019 most casual enthusiasts of bitcoin believe it is perfectly traceable; this is completely false. Around 2011 most casual enthusiasts believed it is totally private; which is also false. There is some nuance - in certain situations bitcoin can be very private. But it is not simple to understand, and it takes some time and reading."}

{"prompt": "Users interact with bitcoin through software which may leak information about them in various ways that damages their anonymity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin records transactions on the block chain which is visible to all and so create the most serious damage to privacy.

The adversary also knows the trap website received coins on address C that were spent from address B. Together this is a very strong indication that address B is owned by Mr. Doe and that he sent money to the trap website. This assumption is not always correct because address B may have been an address held on behalf of Mr. Doe by a third party and the transaction to C may have been unrelated, or the two transactions may actually involve a smart contract (See Off-Chain Transactions) which effectively teleports the coins off-chain to a completely different address somewhere on the blockchain."}

As the coins were obtained by mining they are entirely unlinked from any other information about you. Since the transaction is a donation, there are no goods or services being sent to you, so you don't have to reveal any delivery mail address. As the entire balance is sent, there is no change address going back that could later leak information. Since the hardware is destroyed there is no record remaining on any discarded hard drives that can later be found.

{"prompt": "Many interpretations are possible just from such a simple transaction. Therefore it's completely false to say that bitcoin transactions are always perfectly traceable, the reality is much more complicated.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Privacy-relevant adversaries who analyze the blockchain usually rely on heuristics (or idioms of use) where certain assumptions are made about what is plausible. The analyst would then ignore or exclude some of these possibilities. But those are only assumptions which can be wrong. Someone who wants better privacy they can intentionally break those assumptions which will completely fool an analyst."}
{"prompt": "When considering privacy you need to think about exactly who you're hiding from.

You could still use this to communicate with a social media website to write your real name, upload a selfie and talk about what you're doing right now. Anybody on the internet could view that information so your privacy would be ruined even though you were using perfectly private technology."}

{"prompt": "Multiple privacy leaks when combined together can be far more damaging to privacy than any single leak. Imagine if a receiver of a transaction is trying to deanonymize the sender. Each privacy leak would eliminate many candidates for who the sender is, two different privacy leaks would eliminate different candidates leaving far fewer candidates remaining. See the diagram for a diagram of this.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Data fusion diagram example with newspaper buyer."}
{"prompt": "Financial privacy is an essential element to fungibility in Bitcoin: if you can meaningfully distinguish one coin from another, then their fungibility is weak. If our fungibility is too weak in practice, then we cannot be decentralized: if someone important announces a list of stolen coins they won't accept coins derived from, you must carefully check coins you accept against that list and return the ones that fail. Everyone gets stuck checking blacklists issued by various authorities because in that world we'd all not like to get stuck with bad coins. This adds friction, transactional costs and allows the blacklist provider to engage in censorship, and so makes Bitcoin less valuable as a money.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Financial privacy is an essential criteria for the efficient operation of a free market: if you run a business, you cannot effectively set prices if your suppliers and customers can see all your transactions against your will. You cannot compete effectively if your competition is tracking your sales. Individually your informational leverage is lost in your private dealings if you don't have privacy over your accounts: if you pay your landlord in Bitcoin without enough privacy in place, your landlord will see when you've received a pay raise and can hit you up for more rent."}
{"prompt": "Financial privacy is essential for personal safety: if thieves can see your spending, income, and holdings, they can use that information to target and exploit you. Without privacy malicious parties have more ability to steal your identity, snatch your large purchases off your doorstep, or impersonate businesses you transact with towards you... they can tell exactly how much to try to scam you for.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Financial privacy is essential for human dignity: no one wants the snotty barista at the coffee shop or their nosy neighbors commenting on their income or spending habits. No one wants their baby-crazy in-laws asking why they're buying contraception (or sex toys). Your employer has no business knowing what church you donate to. Only in a perfectly enlightened discrimination free world where no one has undue authority over anyone else could we retain our dignity and make our lawful transactions freely without self-censorship if we don't have privacy."}
{"prompt": "Most importantly, financial privacy isn't incompatible with things like law enforcement or transparency. You can always keep records, be ordered (or volunteer) to provide them to whomever, have judges hold against your interest when you can't produce records (as is the case today). None of this requires _globally_ visible public records.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Globally visible public records in finance are completely unheard-of. They are undesirable and arguably intolerable. The Bitcoin whitepaper made a promise of how we could get around the visibility of the ledger with pseudonymous addresses, but the ecosystem has broken that promise in a bunch of places and we ought to fix it. Bitcoin could have coded your name or IP address into every transaction. It didn't. The whitepaper even has a section on privacy. It's incorrect to say that Bitcoin isn't focused on privacy. Sufficient privacy is an essential prerequisite for a viable digital currency[2]."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin uses a UTXO model. Transactions have inputs and outputs, they can have one or more of each. Previous outputs can be used as inputs for later transactions. An output which hasn't been spent yet is called an unspent transaction output (UTXO). UXTOs are often called \"coins\". UTXOs are associated with a bitcoin address and can be spent by creating a valid signature corresponding to the scriptPubKey of the address.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Addresses are cryptographic information, essentially random numbers. On their own they do not reveal much about the real owner of any bitcoins on them. Usually an adversary will try to link together multiple addresses which they believe belong to the same wallet. Such address collections are called \"clusters\", \"closures\" or \"wallet clusters\", and the activity of creating them is called \"wallet clustering\". Once the clusters are obtained the adversary can try to link them real-world identities of entities it wants to spy on. For example, it may find wallet cluster A belonging to Alice and another wallet cluster B belonging to Bob. If a bitcoin transaction is seen paying from cluster A to cluster B then the adversary knows that Alice has sent coins to Bob."}
{"prompt": "This is a heuristic or assumption which says that if a transaction has more than one input then all those inputs are owned by the same entity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " For example, consider this transaction with inputs A, B and C; and outputs X and Y."}
{"prompt": "Many bitcoin transactions have change outputs. It would be a serious privacy leak if the change address can be somehow found, as it would link the ownership of the (now spent) inputs with a new output. Change outputs can be very effective when combined with other privacy leaks like the common-input-ownership heuristic or address reuse. Change address detection allows the adversary to cluster together newly created address, which the common-input-ownership heuristic and address reuse allows past addresses to be clustered.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Change addresses lead to a common usage pattern called the peeling chain. It is seen after a large transactions from exchanges, marketplaces, mining pools and salary payments. In a peeling chain, a single address begins with a relatively large amount of bitcoins. A smaller amount is then peeled off this larger amount, creating a transaction in which a small amount is transferred to one address, and the remainder is transferred to a one-time change address. This process is repeated - potentially for hundreds or thousands of hops - until the larger amount is pared down, at which point (in one usage) the amount remaining in the address might be aggregated with other such addresses to again yield a large amount in a single address, and the peeling process begins again[5]."}
{"prompt": "If an output address has been reused it is very likely to be a payment output, not a change output. This is because change addresses are created automatically by wallet software but payment addresses are manually sent between humans. The address reuse would happen because the human user reused an address out of ignorance or apathy. This heuristic is probably the most accurate, as it is very hard to imagine how false positives would arise (except by intentional design of wallets). This heuristic is also called the \"shadow heuristic\".\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some very old software (from the 2010-2011 era which did not have Deterministic wallets) did not use a new address change but sent the change back to the input address. This reveals the change address exactly."}
{"prompt": "Avoiding address reuse is an obvious remedy. Another idea is that those wallets could automatically detect when a payment address has been used before (perhaps by asking the user) and then use a reused address as their change address; so both outputs would be reused addresses.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Also, most reused addresses are mentioned on the internet, forums, social networks like Facebook, Reddit, Stackoverflow...etc. These addresses you can find and check on https://checkbitcoinaddress.com/ site. It's like a little bit de-anonymization of pseudo-anonymized blockchain."}
{"prompt": "Address formats. Wallets generally only use one address type. If a transaction has all inputs and one output of the same address type (e.g. p2pkh), with the remaining output of a different type (p2sh), then a reasonable assumption is that the same-address-format output (p2pkh) is change and the different-address-format output (p2sh) is the payment which belongs to someone else.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Script types. Each wallet generally uses only one script. For example, the sending wallet may be a P2SH 2-of-3 multisignature wallet, which makes a transaction to two outputs: one 2-of-3 multisignature address and the other 2-of-2 multisignature address. The different script is a strong indication that the output is payment and the other output is change."}
{"prompt": "BIP69 Lexicographical Indexing of Transaction Inputs and Outputs. This BIP describes a standard way for wallets to order their inputs and outputs for privacy. Right now the wallet ecosystem has a mixture of wallets which do and don't implement the standard, which helps with fingerprinting. Note that the common one-input-two-output transaction with random ordering will follow BIP69 just by chance 50% of the time.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Number of inputs and outputs. Different users often construct transactions differently. For example, individuals often make transaction with just two outputs; a payment and change, while high-volume institutions like casinos or exchanges use consolidation and batching[6][7]. An output that is later use to create a batching transaction was probably not the change. This heuristic is also called the \"consumer heuristic\"."}
{"prompt": "Transaction fields. Values in the transaction format which may vary depending on the wallet software: nLockTime is a field in transactions set by some wallets to make fee sniping less profitable. A mixture of wallets in the ecosystem do and don't implement this feature. nLockTime can also be used as in certain privacy protocols like CoinSwap. nSequence is another example. Also the version number.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Low-R value signatures. The DER format used to encode Bitcoin signatures requires adding an entire extra byte to a signature just to indicate when the signature\u2019s R value is on the top-half of the elliptical curve used for Bitcoin. The R value is randomly derived, so half of all signatures have this extra byte. As of July 2018[8]Bitcoin Core only generates signatures with a low-R value that don't require this extra byte. By doing so, Bitcoin Core transactions will save one byte per every two signatures (on average). As of 2019 no other wallet does this, so a high-R signature is evidence that Bitcoin Core is not being used[9]."}
{"prompt": "Uncompressed and compressed public keys. Older wallet software uses uncompressed public keys[10]. A mixture of compressed and uncompressed keys can be used for fingerprinting.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Miner fees. Various wallet softwares may respond to block space pressure in different ways which could lead to different kinds of miner fees being paid. This might also be a way of fingerprinting wallets."}
{"prompt": "Coin Selection. Various wallet softwares may choose which UTXOs to spend using different algorithms that could be used for fingerprinting.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If multiple users are using the same wallet software, then wallet fingerprinting cannot detect the change address. It is also possible that a single user owns two different wallets which use different software (for example a hot wallet and cold wallet) and then transactions between different softwares would not indicate a change of ownership. Wallet fingerprinting on its own is never decisive evidence, but as with all other privacy leaks it works best with data fusion when multiple privacy leaks are combined."}
{"prompt": "Now both interpretations imply that some inputs are unnecessary. Unfortunately this costs more in miner fees and can only be done if the wallet actually owns other UTXOs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some wallets have a coin selection algorithm which violates this heuristic. An example might be because the wallets want to consolidate inputs in times of cheap miner fees. So this heuristic is not decisive evidence."}
{"prompt": "For example, for a transaction with 1 input spending a p2pkh coin and creating 2 outputs, one of p2pkh and one of p2sh, it is very likely that the p2pkh output is the change while the p2sh one is the payment.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This is also possible if the inputs are of mixed types (created by wallets supporting multiple script types for backwards compatibility). If one of the output script types is known to be used by the wallet (because the same script type is spent by at least one of the inputs) while the other is not, the other one is likely to be the payment."}
{"prompt": "Blockchain transactions contain amount information of the transaction inputs and outputs, as well as an implicit amount of the miner fee. This is visible to all.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Often the payment amount of a transaction is a round number, possibly when converted to another currency. An analysis of round numbers in bitcoin transactions has been used to measure the countries or regions where payment have happened[13]."}
{"prompt": "Payments that send exact amounts and take no change are a likely indication that the bitcoins didn't move hands.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This usually means that the user used the \"send maximum amount\" wallet feature to transfer funds to her new wallet, to an exchange account, to fund a lightning channel, or other similar cases where the bitcoins remain under the same ownership."}
{"prompt": "Payment batching is a technique to reduce the miner fee of a payment. It works by batching up several payments into one block chain transaction. It is typically used by exchanges, casinos and other high-volume spenders.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The privacy implication comes in that recipients can see the amount and address of recipients[15]"}
{"prompt": "When you receive your withdrawal from Kraken, you can look up your transaction on a block chain explorer and see the addresses of everyone else who received a payment in the same transaction. You don\u2019t know who those recipients are, but you do know they received bitcoins from Kraken the same as you.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " That\u2019s not good for privacy, but it\u2019s also perhaps not the worst thing. If Kraken made each of those payments separately, they might still be connected together through the change outputs and perhaps also by certain other identifying characteristics that block chain analysis companies and private individuals use to fingerprint particular spenders."}
{"prompt": "Most but not all bitcoin scripts are single-signature. Other scripts are possible with the most common being multisignature. A script which is particularly unusual can leak information simply by being so unique.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " 2-of-3 multisig is by far the most common non-single-signature script as of 2019."}
{"prompt": "This attack is sometimes incorrectly called a dust attack[18].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If the forced-payment coins have landed on already-used empty addresses, then the correct behaviour by wallets is to not spend those coins ever. If the coins have landed on addresses which are not empty, then the correct behaviour by wallets is to fully-spend all the coins on that address in the same transaction."}
{"prompt": "For example, say we're using any black box privacy technology that breaks the transaction graph.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " V --> [black box privacy tech] --> V - fee"}
{"prompt": "The privacy tech is used to mix V amount of bitcoins, and it returns V bitcoins minus fees back to the user. Amount correlation could be used to unmix this tech by searching the blockchain for transactions with an output amount close to V.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A way to resist amount correlation is to split up the sending of bitcoins back to user into many transactions with output amounts (w0, w1, w2) which together add up to V minus fees."}
{"prompt": "An adversary able to snoop on your internet connection (such as your government, ISP, Wifi provider or VPN provider) can see data sent and received by your node. This would reveal that you are a bitcoin user. Even if a connection is encrypted the adversary could still see the timings and sizes of data packets. A block being mined results in a largely synchronized burst of identically-sized traffic for every bitcoin node, because of this bitcoin nodes are very vulnerable to traffic analysis revealing the fact that bitcoin is being used.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " If the adversary sees a transaction or block coming out of your node which did not previously enter, then it can know with near-certainty that the transaction was made by you or the block was mined by you. As internet connections are involved, the adversary will be able to link the IP address with the discovered bitcoin information."}
{"prompt": "A certain kind of sybil attack can be used to discover the source of a transaction or block without the adversary entirely controlling the victims internet connection. It works by the adversary creating many of their own fake nodes on different IP addresses which aggressively announce themselves in an effort to attract more nodes to connect to them, they also try to connect to as many other listening nodes as they can. This high connectivity help the adversary to locate the source newly-broadcasted transactions and blocks by tracking them as they propagate through the network.[19][20][21][22]. Some wallets periodically rebroadcast their unconfirmed transactions so that they are more likely to propagate widely through the network and be mined.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some wallets are not full nodes but are lightweight nodes which function in a different way. They generally have far worse privacy properties, but how badly depends on the details of each wallet. Some lightweight wallets can be connected only to your own full node, and if that is done then their privacy with respect to traffic analysis will be improved to the level of a full node."}
{"prompt": "Blockchain explorer websites are commonly used. Some users even search for their transaction on those websites and refresh it until it reaches 3 confirmations. This is very bad for privacy as the website can easily link the user's IP address to their bitcoin transaction (unless tor is used), and the queries to their website reveal that the transaction or address is of interest to somebody who has certain behavioural patterns.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " To get information about your transactions it is much better to use your wallet software, not some website."}
{"prompt": "Electrum is a popular software wallet which works by connecting to special purpose servers. These servers receive hashes of the bitcoin addresses in the wallet and reply with transaction information. The Electrum wallet is fast and low-resource but by default it connects to these servers which can easily spy on the user. Some other software aside from Electrum uses the public Electrum servers. As of 2019 it is a faster and better alternative for lightweight wallets than BIP37.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Servers only learn the hashes of addresses rather than addresses themselves, in practice they only know the actual address and associated transactions if it's been used on the blockchain at least once."}
{"prompt": "A simple but effective privacy leak. Alice gives Bob one of her addresses to receive a payment, but the communication has been eavesdropped by Eve who saw the address and now knows it belongs to Alice. The solution is to encrypt addresses where appropriate or use another way of somehow hiding them from an adversary as per the threat model.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Sometimes the eavesdropping can be very trivial, for example some forum users publish a bitcoin donation address on their website, forum signature, profile, twitter page, etc where it can be picked up by search engines. In the example of the non-anonymous Chinese newspaper buyer from the introduction, his address being publicly visible on his forum signature was a crucial part of his deanonymization. The solution here is to show each potential donator a new address, for example by setting up a web server to hand out unique addresses to each visitor."}
{"prompt": "Wallet software usually stores information it needs to operate on the disk of the computer it runs on. If an adversary has access to that disk it can extract bitcoin addresses and transactions which are known to be linked with the owner of that disk. The same disk might contain other personal information (such as a scan of an ID card). Digital forensics is one reason why all good wallet software encrypts wallet files, although that can be beaten if a weak encryption password is used.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " For example if you have a bitcoin wallet installed on your PC and give the computer to a repair shop to fix, then the repair shop operator could find the wallet file and records of all your transactions. Other examples might be if an old hard disk is thrown away. Other software installed on the same computer (such as malware) can also read from disk or RAM to spy on the bitcoin transactions made by the user."}
{"prompt": "For privacy don't leave data on your computer available to others. Exactly how depends on your threat model. Encryption and physical protection are options, as is using special operating systems like Tails OS which does not read or write from the hard drive but only uses RAM, and then deletes all data on shutdown.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Methods for improving privacy (non-blockchain)"}
{"prompt": "Many exchanges require users to undergo Anti-Money Laundering and Know-Your-Customer (AML/KYC) checks, which requires users to reveal all kinds of invasive personal information such as their real name, residence, occupation and income. All this information is then linked with the bitcoin addresses and transactions that are later used.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Avoiding the privacy invasion of AML/KYC is probably the single most important thing an individual can do to improve their privacy. It works far better than any actual technology like CoinJoin. Indeed all the cryptography and privacy tricks are irrelevant if all users only ever transact between AML/KYC institutions[23]."}
{"prompt": "This section won't list websites to find such meetups because the information can go out of date, but try searching the web with \"buy bitcoin for cash <your location>\". Note that some services still require ID so that is worth checking. Some services require ID only for the trader placing the advert. As of late-2018 there is at least one decentralized exchange open source project in development which aims to facilitate this kind of trading without a needing a centralized third party at all but instead using a peer-to-peer network.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cash-in-person trades are an old and popular method. Two traders arrange to meet up somewhere and the buyer hands over cash while the seller makes a bitcoin transaction to the buyer. This is similar to other internet phenomena like Craigslist which organize meetups for exchange. Escrow can be used to improve safety or to avoid the need to wait for confirmations at the meetup."}
{"prompt": "Cash-by-mail works by having the buyer send physical cash through the mail. Escrow is always used to prevent scamming. The buyer of bitcoins can be very anonymous but the seller must reveal a mail address to the buyer. Cash-by-mail can work over long distances but does depend on the postal service infrastructure. Users should check with their local postal service if there are any guidelines around sending cash-by-mail. Often the cash can also be insured.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cash deposit is a method where the buyer deposits cash directly into the seller's bank account. Again escrow is used, and again the buyer of bitcoins can be near-anonymous but the seller must sign up with a bank or financial institution and share with them rather invasive details about one's identity and financial history. This method relies on the personal banking infrastructure so works over long distances."}
{"prompt": "In theory another way of obtaining anonymous bitcoin is to steal them.[24]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There is at least one situation where this happened. In May 2015 a hacker known as Phineas Fisher[25] hacked a spyware company that was selling surveillance products to dictators[26]. The hacker used bitcoin stolen from other people to anonymously rent infrastructure for later attacks."}
{"prompt": "Bitcoin Core and its forks have countermeasures against sybil attack and eclipse attacks. Eclipse attacks are sybil attacks where the adversary attempts to control all the peers of its target and block or control access to the rest of the network[29]. Such attacks have been extensively studied in a 2015 paper Eclipse Attacks on Bitcoin\u2019s Peer-to-Peer Network which has led to new code written for Bitcoin Core for mitigation.[30][31][32][33][34]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin Core and its forks use an algorithm known as trickling when relaying unconfirmed transactions, with the aim of making it as difficult as possible for sybil attackers to find the source IP address of a transaction. For each peer, the node keeps a list of transactions that it is going to inv to it. It sends inv's for transactions periodically with a random delay between each inv. Transactions are selected to go into the inv message somewhat randomly and according to some metrics involving fee rate. It selects a limited number of transactions to inv. The algorithm creates the possibility that a peered node may hear about an unconfirmed transaction from the creator's neighbours rather than the creator node itself[35][36][37][38]. However adversaries can still sometimes obtain privacy-relevant information."}
{"prompt": "If a connection-controlling adversary is a concern, then bitcoin can be run entirely over tor. Tor is encrypted and hides endpoints, so an ISP or Wifi providers won't even know you're using bitcoin. The other connected bitcoin nodes won't be able to see your IP address as tor hides it. Bitcoin Core and its forks have features to make setting up and using tor easier. Some lightweight wallets also run entirely over tor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Running entirely over tor has the downside that synchronizing the node requires downloading the entire blockchain over tor, which would be very slow. Downloading blocks over Tor only helps in the situation where you want to hide the fact that bitcoin is even being used from the internet service provider[39]. It is possible to download blocks and unconfirmed transactions over clearnet but broadcast your own transactions over tor, allowing a fast clearnet connection to be used while still providing privacy when broadcasting."}
{"prompt": "Some privacy technologies like CoinJoin and CoinSwap require interactivity between many bitcoin entities. They can also be used to broadcast transactions with more privacy, because peers in the privacy protocols can send each other unconfirmed transactions using the already-existing protocol they use to interact with each other.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " For example, in JoinMarket market takers can send transactions to market makers who will broadcast them and so improve the taker's privacy. This can be a more convenient for the taker than setting up Tor for use with tor broadcasting."}
{"prompt": "Methods for improving privacy (blockchain)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This section describes different techniques for improving the privacy of transactions related to the permanent record of transactions on the blockchain. Some techniques are trivial and are included in all good bitcoin wallets. Others have been implemented in some open source projects or services, which may use more than one technique at a time. Other techniques have yet to be been implemented. Many of these techniques focus on breaking different heuristics and assumptions about the blockchain, so they work best when combined together."}
{"prompt": "It has been argued that the phrase \"bitcoin address\" was a bad name for this object because it implies it can be reused like an email address. A better name would be something like \"bitcoin invoice\".\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bitcoin isn't anonymous but pseudonymous, and the pseudonyms are bitcoin addresses. Avoiding address reuse is like throwing away a pseudonym after its been used."}
{"prompt": "The easiest way to avoid the privacy loss from forced address reuse to not spend coins that have landed on an already-used and empty addresses. Usually the payments are of a very low value so no relevant money is lost by simply not spending the coins.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Another option is to spend the coins individual directly to miner fees. Here are instructions for how to do this with Electrum or Bitcoin Core: https://gist.github.com/ncstdc/90fe6209a0b3ae815a6eaa2aef53524c"}
{"prompt": "Coin control is a feature of some bitcoin wallets that allow the user to choose which coins are to be spent as inputs in an outgoing transaction. Coin control is aimed to avoid as much as possible transactions where privacy leaks are caused by amounts, change addresses, the transaction graph and the common-input-ownership heuristic[48][49].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " An example for avoiding a transaction graph privacy leak with coin control: A user is paid bitcoin for their employment, but also sometimes buys bitcoin with cash. The user wants to donate some money to a charitable cause they feel passionately about, but doesn't want their employer to know. The charity also has a publicly-visible donation address which can been found by web search engines. If the user paid to the charity without coin control, his wallet may use coins that came from the employer, which would allow the employer to figure out which charity the user donated to. By using coin control, the user can make sure that only coins that were obtained anonymously with cash were sent to the charity. This avoids the employer ever knowing that the user financially supports this charity."}
{"prompt": "Change avoidance is where transaction inputs and outputs are carefully chosen to not require a change output at all. Not having a change output is excellent for privacy, as it breaks change detection heuristics.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Change avoidance is practical for high-volume bitcoin services, which typically have a large number of inputs available to spend and a large number of required outputs for each of their customers that they're sending money to. This kind of change avoidance also lowers miner fees because the transactions uses less block space overall."}
{"prompt": "Main article: Techniques_to_reduce_transaction_fees#Change_avoidance\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Another way to avoid creating a change output is in cases where the exact amount isn't important and an entire UTXO or group of UTXOs can be fully-spent. An example is when opening a Lightning Network payment channel. Another example would be when sweeping funds into a cold storage wallet where the exact amount may not matter."}
{"prompt": "ECDSA-2P is a cryptographic scheme which allows the creation of a 2-of-2 multisignature scheme but which results in a regular single-sig ECDSA signature when included on the blockchain[51]. It doesn't need any consensus changes because bitcoin already uses ECDSA.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Schnorr is a digital signature scheme which has many benefits over the status-quo ECDSA[52][53]. One side effect is that any N-of-N[54] and M-of-N multisignature can be easily made to look like a single-sig when included on the blockchain. Adding Schnorr to bitcoin requires a Softfork consensus change. As of 2019 a design for the signature scheme has been proposed[55]. The required softfork consensus change is still in the design stage as of early-2019."}
{"prompt": "Scriptless scripts are a set of cryptographic protocols which provide a way of replicating the logic of script without actually having the script conditions visible, which increases privacy and scalability by removing information from the blockchain[56][57][58][59]. This is generally aimed at protocols involving Hash Time Locked Contracts such as Lightning Network and CoinSwap.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " With scriptless scripts, nearly the only thing visible is the public keys and signatures. More than that, in multi-party settings, there will be a single public key and a single signature for all the actors. Everything looks the same-- lightning payment channels would look the same as single-sig payments, escrows, atomic swaps, or sidechain federation pegs. Pretty much anything you think about that people are doing on bitcoin in 2019, can be made to look essentially the same[60]."}
{"prompt": "MAST is short for Merkelized Abstract Syntax Tree, which is a scheme for hiding unexecuted branches of a script contract. It improves privacy and scalability by removing information from the blockchain[61][62].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Taproot is a way to combine Schnorr signatures with MAST[63]. The Schnorr signature can be used to spend the coin, but also a MAST tree can be revealed only when the user wants to use it. The schnorr signature can be any N-of-N or use any scriptless script contract. The consequence of taproot is a much larger anonymity set for interesting smart contracts, as any contract such as Lightning Network, CoinSwap, multisignature, etc would appear indistinguishable from regular single-signature on-chain transaction."}
{"prompt": "The taproot scheme is so useful because it is almost always the case that interesting scripts have a logical top level branch which allows satisfaction of the contract with nothing other than a signature by all parties. Other branches would only be used where some participant is failing to cooperate.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Graftroot is a smart contract scheme similar to taproot. It allows users to include other possible scripts for spending the coin but with less resources used even than taproot. The tradeoff is that interactivity is required between the participants[64][65][66]."}
{"prompt": "ECDH addresses can be used to improve privacy by helping avoid address reuse. For example, a user can publish a ECDH address as a donation address which is usable by people who want to donate. An adversary can see the ECDH donation address but won't be able to easily find any transactions spending to and from it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " However ECDH addresses do not solve all privacy problems as they are still vulnerable to mystery shopper payments; an adversary can donate some bitcoins and watch on the blockchain to see where they go afterwards, using heuristics like the common-input-ownership heuristic to obtain more information such as donation volume and final destination of funds."}
{"prompt": "This is an old method for breaking the transaction graph. Also called \"tumblers\" or \"washers\". A user would send bitcoins to a mixing service and the service would send different bitcoins back to the user, minus a fee. In theory an adversary observing the blockchain would be unable to link the incoming and outgoing transactions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " There are several downsides to this. The mixer it must be trusted to keep secret the linkage between the incoming and outgoing transactions. Also the mixer must be trusted not to steal coins. This risk of stealing creates reputation effects; older and more established mixers will have a better reputation and will be able to charge fees far above the marginal cost of mixing coins. Also as there is no way to sell reputation, the ecosystem of mixers will be filled with occasional exit scams."}
{"prompt": "There is a better alternative to mixers which has essentially the same privacy and custody risks. A user could deposit and then withdraw coins from any regular bitcoin website that has a hot wallet. As long as the bitcoin service doesn't require any other information from the user, it has the same privacy and custody aspects as a centralized mixer and is also much cheaper. Examples of suitable bitcoin services are bitcoin casinos, bitcoin poker websites, tipping websites, altcoin exchanges or online marketplaces[67].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The problem of the service having full knowledge of the transactions could be remedied by cascading several services together. A user who wants to avoid tracking by passive observers of the blockchain could first send coins to a bitcoin casino, from them withdraw and send directly to an altcoin exchange, and so on until the user is happy with the privacy gained."}
{"prompt": "CoinSwaps break the transaction graph between the sent and received bitcoins. On the block chain it looks like two sets of completely disconnected transactions:\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Alice's Address ---> escrow address 1 ---> Bob's Address"}
{"prompt": "Bob's Address   ---> escrow address 2 ---> Alice's Address\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Obviously Alice and Bob generate new addresses each to avoid the privacy loss due to address reuse."}
{"prompt": "It is possible to have CoinSwaps that are completely indistinguishable from any other transaction on the blockchain. They could be said to allow bitcoins to teleport undetectably to anywhere else on the blockchain. Non-CoinSwap transactions would benefit because a large-scale analyst of the blockchain like a transaction surveillance company could never be sure that ordinary transactions are not actually CoinSwaps. They also do not require much block space compared to the amount of privacy they provide.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " CoinSwaps require a lot of interaction between the involved parties, which can make this kind of system tricky to design while avoiding denial-of-service attacks. They also have a liveness requirement and non-censorship requirement, meaning that the entities taking part must always be able to freely access the bitcoin network; If the internet was down for days or weeks then half-completed CoinSwaps could end with one side having their money stolen."}
{"prompt": "CoinJoinXT is non-custodial privacy technique which is closely related to CoinJoin[77]. It allows for any number of entities to between them create a so-called proposed transaction graph (PTG) which is a list of connected transactions. In the PTG the bitcoins belonging to the entities are sent to and fro in all the transactions, but at the end of the PTG they are all returned to their rightful owners. The system is set up so that the process of the PTG being mined is atomic, so either the entire PTG is confirmed on the blockchain or none of it is, this means none of the participating entities can steal from each other.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The proposed transaction graph has the freedom to be any list of transactions that obfuscate the transaction graph. For best results the PTG would perfectly mimic the natural transaction graph due to normal economic activity in bitcoin, and so an adversary would not know where the PTG started or ended, resulting in a massive privacy gain."}
{"prompt": "TumbleBit is privacy technology which is non-custodial and where the coordinating server cannot tell the true linkage between input and output. This is achieved by a cryptographic construct where the server facilitates a private exchange of digital signatures. The protocol is very interesting to any privacy and bitcoin enthusiast.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " From the point of view of an observer of the blockchain, TumbleBit transactions appear as two transactions with many (800 in the author's example) outputs and all transaction outputs must be of the same amount."}
{"prompt": "Off-Chain Transactions are one way to avoid this trade-off between privacy and scalability. These kind of solutions improve privacy by entirely removing data from the blockchain, not by adding more decoy data. Change avoidance and Script privacy improvements also reduce costs to the system while improving privacy. CoinJoinXT, equal-output CoinJoin, TumbleBit use a lot of block space relative to the privacy gain. PayJoin does not use much extra block space over making an ordinary transaction; relative to the gain of breaking the common-input-ownership heuristic it is very space-efficent. CoinSwap uses very little block space relative to privacy, as it can be understood as an off-chain transaction system which makes a single transaction and then comes back on-chain. Confidential transactions requires a lot of block space along with associated bandwidth and CPU costs, but its privacy gain is substantial, so the debate on that topic could go either way.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In the long term as bitcoin miner fees go up, resource-costly privacy technologies will be priced out and replaced by resource-efficient ones."}
{"prompt": "An equal-output CoinJoin hides the source and destination of a certain coin, but the structure of the transactions reveals that something is being hidden. So even though coinjoin breaks the common-input-ownership heuristic, the fact that equal-output coinjoins can be detected (even if the detection is imperfect) allows them to be excluded from by the adversary's analysis. Also the distinguishability of the coinjoins may attract suspicion and prompt more investigation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The idea of steganography is a good thing to aim for[78]. It greatly increases the privacy because the transactions made by such technology cannot be distinguished from regular transactions. Also it improves the privacy of users who don't even use the technology, as their transactions can always be confused with actual private transactions. Scriptless scripts are a great example of a steganographic privacy technology where the privacy-relevant information is hidden in the random numbers of the digital signatures. PayJoin, CoinSwap and CoinJoinXT are good steganographic privacy technologies because they can be made indistinguishable from regular bitcoin transactions. Equal-output coinjoins and TumbleBit are not steganographic. Also it is usually easy to see when a centralized Mixing service is being used with common-input-ownership heuristic analysis, but depositing and then withdrawing from a high-volume bitcoin website like a casino or altcoin exchange is better because its possible that the user simply wanted to gamble."}
{"prompt": "As well as greatly improving privacy, Lightning Network transactions are also much faster (usually instant) and cheaper than on-chain transactions. Lightning nodes create two-way payment channels between them, and lightning transactions are routed from one node to another. The source and destination node don't need to have a payment channel directly between them as transactions can be routed over many intermediate nodes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As Lightning Network transactions happen off-chain, they are not broadcast to every node in the network and are not stored forever in a publicly-visible blockchain. Adversaries cannot look at a public permanent record of all transactions because there isn't one. Instead adversaries would possibly have to run intermediate nodes and possibly extract information that way. On-chain privacy attacks like the common-input-ownership heuristic, address reuse, change address detection, input amounts revealing sender wealth or mystery shopper payments fundamentally don't work because there are no addresses or transaction inputs/outputs that work in the same way."}
{"prompt": "However Lightning Network may introduce other privacy problems, mostly due to how the network is made up of nodes having connections between them[79]. The parts of this network which can be intermediate routing nodes are usually public, and this network information could be overlaid with information about routed packets such as their amount. Lightning nodes also reveal their IP addresses unless run over Tor, and the payment channels are made up of on-chain transactions which could be analyzed using regular blockchain analysis techniques. Payment channels look like 2-of-2 multisignature on the blockchain. Bilaterial closing transactions look like the 2-of-2 outputs have been spent, but unilateral close transactions have a complicated HTLC scripts that is visible on the blockchain.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As of 2019 Lightning is in beta and development continues; the development community is still studying all its privacy properties. Certainly its privacy is better than the privacy of on-chain transactions."}
{"prompt": "Onion routing overlaid with network topology\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Lightning Network's onion routing is usually compared with Tor onion routing. However, Tor's network is fully-connected; every node on Tor is directly connected (or has the potential to directly connect) with every other node, meaning that an onion-routed packet can be relayed from and to potentially any other node. This is not so in the Lightning Network, where payment channels do not fully-connect the entire network, and where the network topology is publicly known for routing nodes. Data fusion of the network topology and the small amount of information from onion-routed packets may still be enough to uncover information in certain cirumstances[82][83]. For example, if a Lightning node wallet has only a single payment channel connection going to one intermediate node, then any payments sent to and from the node wallet will have to pass through the intermediate node, which would be able to obtain a lot of information about the wallet node's payments regardless of the onion-routing used."}
{"prompt": "A mitigation to this topology problem may be that the entire topology of the Lightning Network is not known. Only nodes which intend to route transactions need to be publicly announced. It is possible for \"private channels\" to exist which are payment channels that exist, but whose existence is not published.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This doesn't mean the onion routing used by Lightning Network is useless, far from it, but the privacy is not as strong as with Tor."}
{"prompt": "For non-AMP payments, the payment hash is the same for all nodes along the route of a payment. This could allow multiple nodes if they co-operate to know that they routed the same payment based on this common hash value. Although this could also be done using the timestamp of each routed payment.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Scriptless scripts used as a replacement to explicit hash time locked contracts can be used to solve the common hashlock problem. It is possible to add a different random tweak value to the committed random value at each step, as a result there can be a multi-hop path through payment channels in which individual participants in the path wouldn't be able to tell that they're in the same path unless they're directly connected because of this re-blinding[88][89]."}
{"prompt": "Lightning-enabled wallets can be of the custodial type, where the wallet is just a front-end that connects to a back-end server run by some company. This is the same situation for web wallets in the on-chain bitcoin ecosystem.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This kind of setup would result in all the user's Lightning Network transactions being visible to that company and so they would have no privacy, in the same way that using a web wallet has no privacy for the on-chain bitcoin space. As of 2019 Zap Wallet and Lightning Peach work on this model. Peach wallet actually has checkboxes in its GUI saying \"I agree to the privacy policy\" and looking through the privacy policy reveals the wallet tracks all kinds of privacy-relevant stuff. Needless to say a privacy-conscious user shouldn't use these kind of lightning wallets but use non-custodial lightning wallets instead[92]."}
{"prompt": "Advances in script type privacy like Schnorr, scriptless scripts, taproot and ECDSA-2P benefit Lightning Network privacy by making its payment channel blockchain transactions appear indistinguishable from regular single-signature blockchain transactions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Probing payments to reveal channel states"}
{"prompt": "The balance state of each channel is hidden from the public and is only known to the two entities making up the payment channel. This provides a lot of privacy, as amounts and changes of the amounts are not visible to all. A possible way to defeat this privacy is for an active adversary to send probing payments until the balance is obtained. Such attack has been proved possible, as described in a paper from the beginning of 2019[93], due to the level of detail that lightning implementations provide about routing errors. Although it would seem that such attack would need to pay the routing fees for the probing payments, the attacker may provide a fake invoice, so even when the payment passes through all the route, the last node will send back an error message and will not be able to execute the payment. So the cost for such attack is reduced to the fees needed to open and close the channels used for the attack.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Such an attack can be used for disclosing the balances of a single or a selected group of nodes of the network and even on a large scale to obtain the balance of each channel in the network. In case the adversary repeats this procedure for every payment channel in the entire Lightning Network and continues probing very frequently, then by watching the change in channel states, they could observe payment being routed around the network. A possible way to remedy this attack would be for routing nodes to randomly (for example 1-out-of-20 times) return a routing error even if the channel balance state is actually adequate. This likely would not degrade the user experience of Lightning Network much, but would impose a serious cost on the attacker."}
{"prompt": "There are several implementations of Lightning Network as of early-2019; such as LND, c-lightning, eclair, etc.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The network itself can be used on bitcoin mainnet and several merchants and other projects accept it. It is still not usable by the general public. It is expected that one day every bitcoin wallet will be able to send and receive lightning network transactions and so the massive privacy benefits will be included in how regular users use bitcoin all the time."}
{"prompt": "Lightning Network wallets usually the standard privacy tech like Deterministic wallets and warnings against address reuse.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some LN wallets such as Zap Wallet and Lightning Peach are actually custodial, they are backed by a centralized server which can spy on everything the user does, so they should be avoided."}
{"prompt": "Other people are always available for coinjoining because they earn fees, and coinjoins can be of any amount and happen at any time. JoinMarket can also be a small source of income for operators of liquidity maker bots, who earn coinjoin fees by allowing other people to create coinjoins with their bitcoins.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Privacy is greatly improved by repeating coinjoins many times, for this reason the JoinMarket project includes the tumbler script where coinjoins are automatically created at random times and for random amounts. Bitcoins can be deposited into the JoinMarket HD wallet and the tumbler script will send them via many coinjoins to three or more destination addresses. This feature of using more than one destination address is required to beat amount correlation. For example a user who wants to deposit coins into an exchange would make use of the Generate New Deposit Address button to obtain more than one destination address, the exchange may then combine those coins with deposits from other customers which should resist any tracking based on amounts."}
{"prompt": "JoinMarket can interface with a Bitcoin Core full node in order to privately obtain the history of its own wallet. There is also an option to use Electrum server, but users are discouraged from using it. There are plans to replace the Electrum interface with one that uses Client-side block filtering.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The software is an open source project with a community based around it. Unfortunately JoinMarket can be difficult to install for people not used to Linux or the command line interface. It is hoped one day there may be work done to make this easier, but as all development is done by volunteers there can be no roadmap for this."}
{"prompt": "Wasabi Wallet is an open-source, non-custodial, privacy-focused Bitcoin wallet for Desktop, that implements trustless CoinJoin. The CoinJoin coordinator (run by zkSNACKs Ltd., the company that is sponsoring the development of Wasabi) cannot steal from, nor breach the privacy of the participants.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The package includes built-in Tor and, by default, all traffic between the clients and the server goes through it, so IP addresses are hidden and privacy of the users is respected. Under normal conditions, Wasabi Wallet never leaves Tor onion network and it never uses Tor exit relays, significantly decreasing the network attack surface."}
{"prompt": "Wasabi also includes all standard privacy tech like a Hierarchical Deterministic wallet and address reuse avoidance, as well as mandatory coin control and labeling. The wallet uses BIP-158 Client-side block filtering to obtain its own transaction history in a private way and it has a one-click partial full node integration as it ships with Bitcoin Knots. If the user already has a Bitcoin full node on a local or remote device, then it is possible to specify the IP address and port, or the Tor onion service, and Wasabi will use it to verify and enforce rules of Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In addition to this, it has advanced cutting-edges features like:"}
{"prompt": "As of 2018 the Liquid sidechain implements Confidential Transaction (CT) which allows bitcoins to be transferred on that sidechain while keeping the transaction amounts hidden. The product is developed by the Blockstream company and is aimed at exchanges and traders. It allows fast transfer of bitcoin in a very private way.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As Liquid is a federated sidechain, users generally need to pass AML checks and give up their personal data in order to use it. Its security model is quite close to having bitcoins on an exchange, because if enough of the functionaries get hacked then all the bitcoins on the sidechain could be stolen. However within that security model you get excellent privacy, and the sidechain itself is marketed towards traders and hedgers who certainly want to keep their trading activities private to stop other traders front-running them."}

{"prompt": "You are an infosec researcher studying bitcoin-stealing malware.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The malware author has coded a ECDH address scheme into their malware."}
{"prompt": "Your analysis of the malware only reveals the ECDH public key rather than bitcoin addresses, so the malware author thinks he is private.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You send a small amount of bitcoin to an address derived from the ECDH public key as a mystery shopper payment."}
{"prompt": "The malware author sends all their received stolen coins to an exchange in one transaction, including your payment.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You can now look on the blockchain and use the common-input-ownership heuristic to get an idea of total amount of bitcoins stolen by the malware."}
{"prompt": "Also you can now contact the exchange who will tell you the real life identity of the malware author, who can now be put in jail.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Lesson: mystery shopper payments along with the common-input-ownership heuristic can be used to deanonymize even people who avoid address reuse."}
{"prompt": "Example - Single-use lightweight wallet over Tor\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You want to anonymously buy something or donate to something online."}
{"prompt": "You install Electrum wallet and configure it to use Tor, or use Tails OS.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You buy bitcoins anonymously with cash and have them sent to your Electrum wallet."}
{"prompt": "You spend the entire balance of bitcoins buying or donating to the thing you want.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " After you're done you delete the wallet and never use it again."}
{"prompt": "Your Electrum wallet used a third-party server which can see all your bitcoin addresses and transaction. As you've connected to it over Tor, the server does not learn your real IP address. As you only use a single bitcoin address once and never again, the server isn't able to cluster together any other addresses. As you spent the entire balance there is no change address which can leak information. This setup actually results in strong privacy even though a third-party server is used.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bad privacy example - Lightweight wallet over Tor used multiple times"}
{"prompt": "Very similar to the previous example, but more than one address and transaction is used.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You want to use bitcoin for more than one use-case, for example buying a novelty hat and paying for a VPN."}
{"prompt": "You install Electrum wallet and configure it to use Tor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " You pay for the novelty hat and have it sent to your mail address."}
{"prompt": "You pay for the VPN to improve your web browsing privacy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As the Electrum wallet queries a third-party Electrum server, that server can link together the two transactions and knows which address is the change address."}
{"prompt": "Therefore the server can easily see that the same person who bought the hat also paid for the VPN. As the hat purchase required revealing your mail address, your mail address can now be linked with the VPN account. So much for anonymous web browsing!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Lesson: The third-party Electrum server was able to link together your two transactions. Avoid this by running your own Electrum server which is backed by your own full node."}

{"prompt": "Its internal database was leaked in March 2014, from which it was possible to build up a near-complete picture of the deposits and withdrawals of its wallets.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Address reuse was also a big factor. The common-input-ownership heuristic was less of a factor because that heuristic was broken by mtgox's import private key feature."}
{"prompt": "Analysis information was also cross-checked by searching the web for all forum posts where a customer writes something like: Help! I made a deposit to MtGox of amount 0.12345 BTC. As I write my transaction has 20 confirmations but the deposit hasn't appeared in the exchange. The forum posts include a date and time. These posts include enough information to search for the corresponding blockchain transaction.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The analysis revealed that there were multiple thefts from mtgox and the exchange was insolvent for most of its existence."}

{"prompt": "The results indicate that ThePirateBay is making hundreds of millions of dollars in donations per day, which is not believable.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A possible explanation of what's actually happening is ThePirateBay accepts donations straight into its account at a bitcoin exchange, which would result that analysis based on the common-input-ownership heuristic gives highly exaggerated figures because it actually finds all deposits to that entire exchange. This has a danger for ThePirateBay that the custodial exchange could block or censor incoming donations."}
{"prompt": "Another possibility is that ThePirateBay is using CoinJoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Real life example - Incorrect clusters found by the common-input-ownership heuristic"}
{"prompt": "The www.walletexplorer.com website uses the common-input-ownership heuristic, address reuse and possibly other techniques to cluster together addresses.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It has a big named cluster called MtGoxAndOthers which has 8.6 million transactions and 3.6 million addresses associated with it as of January 2019."}
{"prompt": "The old Mt. Gox exchange had a feature where users could import bitcoin private keys from their personal wallet straight into the website[101].

{"prompt": "For example the transaction 5ac0210febf7ce07a737bae8c32f84c1c54d131c21a16ca6b02b6f1edcad15c3 which is probably a JoinMarket transaction belongs to the MtGoxAndOthers cluster[103].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Another example is the transaction 52757ed33a235ce8e48aeaabab7f6dd9cd3445c3642630123103b154ee59f3f5 which is a coinjoin created by the old SharedCoin centralized service[104], it is also in the MtGoxAndOthers cluster according to walletexplorer."}
{"prompt": "Real life example - Handmade coinjoin mislead a bitcoin analyist\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The inventor of CoinJoin Greg Maxwell posted a thread on bitcointalk forums called \"I taint rich!\" which aimed to demonstrate coinjoin and how the common-input-ownership heuristic is not always correct."}
{"prompt": "The thread invited forum readers to create CoinJoins by hand with Greg Maxwell's vanity address, which he hopes would be a strong demonstration of the flaws of the common-input-ownership heuristic.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Many years later, a bitcoin transaction worth 40000 BTC was broadcasted and mined which caused some speculation on bitcoin forums. The handmade coinjoins caused some to come to the wrong conclusion that Greg Maxwell was the owner of the 40000 BTC."}
{"prompt": "If you follow the 40k from that transaction (click the outputs), you get to the transaction you linked to. It's a short series of transactions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Basically, someone who owns that address was able to unlock coins from that address, as well as another address that held the 40,000, in the same transaction. So they must have owned both (at least 4 years ago anyway)."}

{"prompt": "In early 2019 the exchange QuadrigaCX shut down and many of its customers were left unable to access their bitcoin deposits, likely forever.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " A customer wanted to analyze the blockchain to find information about QuadrigaCX's wallet."}
{"prompt": "They asked on internet forums for other customers to reveal their deposit addresses and transactions, many customers did so.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Using www.walletexplorer.com the analyst was able to find a big wallet cluster containing all those addresses, it is likely this is the QuadrigaCX hot wallet. The hot wallet made many transactions, often involve reused addresses and didn't use CoinJoin; so it's likely that this analysis is correct."}
{"prompt": "The walletexplorer cluster called MtGoxAndOthers mislead the analyst into believing the QuadrigaCX had something to do with MtGox, when in reality that cluster arises because of CoinJoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The analyst was unable to find a single cluster with a significant amount of bitcoins which could be the cold storage wallet. However cold storage wallets are likely to create few transactions and never reuse addresses; so its possible such a cluster would never appear on walletexplorer.com which uses the common-input-ownership heuristic. However its also possible that the exchange is insolvent and so there is no cold storage wallet."}
{"prompt": "Real life example - Stopping Bustabit casino customers getting banned from Coinbase.com\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Coinbase.com is a bitcoin exchange. Bustabit is an online casino that uses bitcoin."}
{"prompt": "In the United States online gambling is illegal (although state government often operates their own lotteries, and meatspace gambling like in Vegas is legal). Coinbase.com enforces this policy by warning and ultimately banning their customers who use online bitcoin casinos.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some of Bustabit's customers were being warned and banned by Coinbase.com."}
{"prompt": "Bustabit implemented change avoidance[105] so many of their withdrawal transactions did not have a change output.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bustabit also imported many thousands of re-used addresses into JoinMarket and made them be used as inputs in many CoinJoin transactions."}
{"prompt": "No more Bustabit customers were ever warned or banned\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " It seems the combination of both methods broke the common-input-ownership heuristic and reduced the privacy-relevant information leaked by change outputs, enough that Coinbase.com's transaction surveillance company partner was unable to identify Bustabit's wallet addresses anymore."}
{"prompt": "Real life example - Rare multisignature scripts\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " As of January 2019 multisignature contracts are visible to any observer of the blockchain."}

These are easily visible as someone's wallet who received some money and then spent it."}
{"prompt": "The bitcoin vault of the Xapo company used a 3-of-5 multisignature scheme. At one point when they moved it which resulted in 90% of the coins held on 3-of-5 multisig addresses moving on the blockchain. This revealed the amount of bitcoin in Xapo's wallet[107].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " In 2016 the exchange Bitfinex was hacked and part of its wallet was stolen. Bitfinex used 2-of-3 multisignature addresses to store its coins. As the thief moved the hacked coins to regular non-multisignature addresses, the movement of 120,000 bitcoins out of 2-of-3 multisig was visible on the blockchain, and it revealed the size of the theft[108]."}

{"prompt": "They offered a 50% bounty for any help or information leading to finding their bitcoins again\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The stolen coins turned out to have been mixed through JoinMarket.

{"prompt": "Bitcoin's blockchain leaks a lot of privacy-relevant information.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Data fusion of these two categories of leaks can reveal a lot of information about people using Bitcoin for online shopping. This is the topic of a 2018 paper called When The Cookie Meets The Blockchain[111]."}
{"prompt": "For example, if a bitcoin user buys a novelty hat and has it shipped to their home and then later the same bitcoin wallet donates to Wikileaks, then the hat merchant and third-party trackers (who know the user's real name and mail address) can figure out that the same user donated to Wikileaks.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " This is example of the power of data fusion, where two or more privacy leaks which when combined reveal far more information than each individual leak."}
{"prompt": "The privacy problems of third-party web tracking cookies have been known for nearly a decade but the situation has not improved much. Privacy can be regained in practice in this situation by 1) Using browser extensions such as uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus or Ghostery to block third-party tracking cookies, and/or 2) Using off-chain transaction methods to make payments where much less privacy-relevant information is leaked. Most practically as of 2019 would be using Lightning Network for online shopping.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bad privacy example - Centralized mixers being easily unmixed with amount correlation"}

{"prompt": "The researchers use address reuse and the common-input-ownership heuristic (the paper authors do not mention the possibility of CoinJoin)\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The researchers connect to every single listening bitcoin node, and attempt to track transactions as they broadcast. This gives them an idea of the originating IP address."}
{"prompt": "The paper identifies about 22,000 bitcoin users by linking their IP address and bitcoin addresses. About 20,000 of these users come from one IP address which is probably a popular web wallet.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The paper collected data during late-2013, but the Bitcoin Core transaction relay algorithm has been changed significantly in the meantime to improve privacy. So the method used should work less well today."}

{"prompt": "A 2018 paper uses tracking techniques to study bitcoin ransomware[114].\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Some ransomware uses static addresses (which implies address reuse) while other ransomware requires victims to connect to a http server that hands out new bitcoin addresses."}
{"prompt": "To find ransomware addresses the researchers found online reports by victims and reverse-engineered ransomware binaries to find addresses within.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " They also used mystery shopper payments, sending 0.001 BTC to ransomware addresses and watching where that coin is sent to. Two ransomware operators (Cerber and Locky) took the bait but one operator (Sage) did not and so his cluster was never found."}
{"prompt": "The researchers use the common-input-ownership heuristic to find clusters of addresses. They know that CoinJoin breaks this assumption and so search for detectable CoinJoin transactions within the clusters which would indicate a break. This was before the invention or implementation of PayJoin so it is assumed that all coinjoins can be detected.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The researchers try to match incoming payments to the ransomware clusters with spikes in Google searches for that ransomware, and uploads of the ransomware binary to malware-tracking websites. If there are spikes in google searches or binary uploads without a corresponding increase in incoming bitcoin payments, then that indicates that the researchers have missed some clusters belonging to the ransomware wallets. This is Timing correlation in use. The researchers conclude they are in fact missing most clusters for CryptoDefense, CryptoLocker, and CryptoWall, but probably have all the clusters for the other ransomware they study."}
{"prompt": "A transaction surveillance company called Chainalysis is used to find the ownership of certain addresses. It works particularly well for exchanges which share their data with Chainalysis. With this the destination of ransomware funds can be tracked. The largest known destination is the BTC-E, a now-shut-down Russian bitcoin exchange with lax controls that was widely known to be used by criminals. However the vast majority of funds is sent to Unknown destinations. One ransomware called CryptoXXX is ~95% sent to Unknown, WannaCry had 100% unknown. The researchers write BTC-E in the paper's abstract and conclusion because that's the biggest destination they could find, but in reality most of the ransomware money could not be tracked\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " The paper is an excellent example of transaction tracking. The researchers take great care in their conclusions, as in blockchain analysis it is sometimes easy to trick yourself into thinking you know more than you do. It is worth reading by anyone interested in bitcoin privacy."}

{"prompt": "Samson Mow: yeah so you mentioned some years ago you tried to get your colleagues, your fellow bankers, into Bitcoin and they didn\u2019t react that well. so how did things change. are they coming to you now and saying, We should have listened to you, Jesse, you were right all along? or what is the dynamic like and what are those conversations like?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: i don\u2019t think that ever happens. people never come back and say, I should have listened to you. but i loved working at Macquarie, and one of the cool things about being at Macquarie is they\u2019ve got a stretch of quarterly profitability that goes back something like 40 or 50 years. so they\u2019re very entrepreneurial and they very much encourage you if you have a good idea to shoot it upstairs and try and advocate for that idea, and to try and push it. so in 2016 i started to think that Bitcoin was probably my good idea, and i started to push it internally. i think people look back at Bitcoin\u2019s history and i think we think about the last four or five weeks in 2017 as really crazy when price went parabolic. but people forget that 2016 was a pretty crazy year too. i mean that was just a constant every day we were up 80 bips. it was just we were going up almost every day and then periodically we\u2019d have like a 30% or 40% drop. but it was up almost every day. so that was 2016 i think was a really interesting year. so my first idea that i pushed internally was, Hey we should do a Bitcoin fund. i was looking at the gbtc and i thought, Well this isn\u2019t a very effective tracker fund \u2014 this could be improved upon, so why don\u2019t we try and take our resources as a bank and repackage this and do something similar but make it a better tracker fund? and the feedback i got on that wasn\u2019t very positive, so there was a lot of pushback. like Bitcoin was seen as very speculative, very risky, and not really great for the bank from a reputational perspective, but as it continued to go higher i mean i was lucky to have a very supportive boss and who was helpful at connecting me into people, and we ended up forming a digital asset working group with people in different geographies in Macquarie \u2014 in australia, in the US\u2014 and i was a key part of that. so we got to do a lot of interesting things that eventually culminated in us putting five million dollars into bitfury. and that happened in 2018. so i think that didn\u2019t really get a lot of press, but i think for the time was very very forward-looking for a bank to do. i also got to do a lot of investor relations events and just basically got put on the road to talk to all our hedge fund clients, engage their level of understanding in Bitcoin, and what their interest was. like would they actually be interested if we could do a product? and that was a really interesting time because it was mid-2017 and Bitcoin was gaining steam but hadn\u2019t had to blow off top yet and i was getting meetings \u2014 like normally i would get a meeting with two or three people at a fund, but i was getting meetings where 19 people would turn out and it would be the whole investment team. it would be traders and it would be portfolio managers and senior cios, so that was really interesting. that\u2019s when i started to realize, Okay, there is a massive amount of institutional interest in this thing. and we also got to do a lot of really good investor relations events \u2014 i\u2019m based in taiwan \u2014 so we had a dinner in taiwan for some senior management clients and then we had charlie lee and bobby lee and vitalik all at the same table and that was an interesting time too because that was like july of \u201817 when ICOs were just starting to get going, and i had just learned about ICOs like that week. and so we got to ask vitalik about it. i was like, Wait this is people are giving people money to do what? and it was just a really interesting and exciting time in the space. and then later that year we also had a really big institutional conference at the same time that people like JP Morgan were doing these blockchain events. we wanted to do one that was very much a Bitcoin event. and that\u2019s when i met you Samson, as i dm\u2019d you on twitter and said, Hey i work at this bank and we want to do a Bitcoin event. would you come and talk to our clients? and you said, Hey i can\u2019t make it but we got this guy Adam Back. i said, Okay yeah, Dr. Back \u2014 we\u2019d be interested in hosting him. so Adam came and then we had J.L., the ceo of tether and Bitfinex, and we had senior guys from bitfury. so looking back it was a really unique opportunity for those investors, and we had 80 or 90 institutional investors at our offices in hong kong, and they got to interact with some of these people who were really heavy-hitters in the industry and asked them questions. and i think that was that was a really exciting time."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: yeah definitely. i think some people forget, but back then Bitcoin was a dirty word. and that\u2019s why i think a lot of the narrative was circled around a blockchain. you talk about the blockchain, you don\u2019t talk about the Bitcoin because that\u2019s sensitive, you don\u2019t want to get into that topic, right? but that was an interesting era. it was like a formative era of Bitcoin where you had to like sneakily talk about Bitcoin without talking about Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah i had people tell me that they would not put their names next to a Bitcoin project. there was just too much reputational risk personally, and then for the bank as well. and so i think we\u2019ve really turned the corner on that with all the institutional investment we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 or 15 months. i think that\u2019s basically in the past now, and there is no reputational risk now for banks to participate in Bitcoin. and that\u2019s a big change."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: yeah, we\u2019ve come a long way. the other thing is you\u2019re outlining a missed opportunity for Macquarie. Macquarie could have been like a gbtc, right? they could have done that years ago.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: realistically, like you can only do what you can do, and they probably couldn\u2019t have got away with that. and in hindsight it was probably a bit naive of me as the loudest internal Bitcoin nut to propose that as the first project. but it did eventually go in a good direction, and some of the people from our digital asset working group also went off to work in the space. so two of the key constituents were the guys that went up and set up iris energy which is a miner \u2014 i think they\u2019ve already IPO\u2019d on the Nasdaq. so i think the banks probably have lost a lot of brain power too to Bitcoin industry because it just pulled people out."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: i guess that\u2019s a good segue to get into mining because you helped get Macquarie actually into mining now. so let\u2019s talk a bit about mining at Blockstream and the BMN. so it\u2019s been great to see an accelerated interest in the BMN. maybe you can give us an introduction of what the BMN is? how it works? what are tranches? and why does Adam Back need to market buy Bitcoin every time we do a tranche?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah. so Blockstream obviously has a fairly large mining business and the BMN is basically our effort to tokenize that business \u2014 which has been predominantly institutional-focused \u2014 and to offer our mining business, that product, to a broader range of investors, whether they\u2019re family offices or individuals. at the moment the BMN is only open to non-US qualified investors, but we\u2019re working on broadening that to US investors as well. it\u2019s not as easy as it sounds and i understand there\u2019s a lot of demand in the US, but it\u2019s a work in progress so i appreciate the patience of the people that are waiting on that. each note is backed by 2,000 terahash, plus or minus, and what investors get is the Bitcoin that that underlying hashrate produces over the course of of 36 months. and what you\u2019re referring to with Adam having to buy Bitcoin in the market is: that\u2019s to maintain fungibility. so if you think about it, we\u2019re issuing these tranches over multiple time periods, so the first one was done in april, and those investors have mined almost two Bitcoin in the 120-plus days since then. so if we do a tranche next week we have to make sure \u2014 for fungibility \u2014 to make sure that the tranche coming up has the same amount of Bitcoin. so you have to go into the market, buy 1.9 Bitcoin, and tie that to the new BMNs that are being issued. and so that\u2019s important for fungibility and to make sure that it\u2019s all apples to apples. and then when we get this thing trading on exchanges, that there\u2019ll be better liquidity, rather than having BMN series 1 tranche A, B, C \u2014 all the way through."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: right. so you\u2019re saying that the BMN is backed by terahash. how does that differ from cloud mining or just leasing machinery from someone else?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah so that\u2019s part of the reason why we have to do it in tranches. our target is obviously 100 million euro \u2014 we go back and forth between euro and us dollars because it\u2019s issued by a luxembourg securitization fund, so most investors are probably more familiar with usd but we do go flip back and forth between euro and usd, which is slightly annoying. but that\u2019s why we have to do multiple tranches is because we have a pipeline of equipment coming in. i think everybody\u2019s very aware of the global semiconductor crunch and how it\u2019s very difficult to get hardware. so we can\u2019t just issue 100 million BMN and then hope the equipment comes in. i think that\u2019s how a lot of cloud miners blew themselves up, and i think they probably \u2014 not all of them, necessarily \u2014 had nefarious intentions when they started, they just got caught up in being unable to meet obligations that they were already committed to. so to prevent that kind of situation, we\u2019re only issuing BMN when we actually received hardware, have it installed, and are beginning to mine. so i think that\u2019s a very big difference to cloud mining. and then the duration too. i mean, 36 months \u2014 you can buy hashrate contracts in the market \u2014 but there\u2019s nothing even close to that duration, 36 months. i think the longest hashrate contracts that i\u2019ve seen are six months. so it\u2019s really a very different beast in terms of products that are currently on the market. and then i guess also that it\u2019s an STO issued by a luxembourg securitization fund. it\u2019s a lot more transparent, there\u2019s offering documents, we\u2019re applying for an ISIN \u2014 it\u2019s just a different level of transparency and of obligations on our end that i think should give investors a bit more of a peace of mind."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: and there\u2019s liquidity, right? you can trade it right away OTC, and it\u2019s coming out on Bitfinex securities.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah, that\u2019s amazing. i\u2019m actually quite amazed to see how we\u2019ve had a organic peer-to-peer market develop in the Telegram chat. i mean to traditional investors the idea that this thing is trading in a Telegram chat probably sounds a little bit insane, but it\u2019s a really cool community and i would definitely recommend taking a look at that Telegram chat, reaching out to us and getting the link, because people are doing a lot of modeling in there on Bitcoin mining that i think is pretty top-notch. and it\u2019s a pretty good source i think for information in general. and then people are trading the BMN back and forth with each other \u2014 of course between whitelisted individuals \u2014 it is a security token so you have to have a whitelist. and yeah the goal ultimately is to have it trading on a lot more exchanges. and Bitfinex securities will be the first step on that, but we hope to have more in the future."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: yeah. link to the Telegram group is right here: t.me/blockstream_finance. so tranche 6 was the largest BMN tranche to date at 13.9 million euros or 16.1 million dollars. and there\u2019s a lot of institutional investors coming in. what\u2019s your take on the future of the BMN and where it\u2019s going?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah so i think the participant mix, the investor mix, is changing a lot. so the first few tranches were heavily skewed towards high net worth Bitcoin-type investors, but i think now we\u2019re having a lot more conversations with more traditional investors. so i think that\u2019s one direction it\u2019s going. i think especially as it gets bigger, we\u2019ll see a lot more interest and participation from more traditional investors. it\u2019s really an interesting product. i think the STO industry is an industry that\u2019s been waiting for a product to push it forward and i think the BMN might be it, because it\u2019s a natively-Bitcoin product and i think it\u2019s one that traditional investors are very interested in. like clearly mining has a lot of investment interest at the moment \u2014 even at the premium the miners are trading at. we\u2019re also working with custodial partners to help custody both the BMN and the Bitcoin that\u2019s produced by the BMN. i think that\u2019ll be a big step to being able to integrate and interact with some of these bigger professional investors. and i think we\u2019ll see more support from trading venues as we go forward. so there\u2019s really no reason why the BMN can\u2019t trade on a national exchange, like a proper traditional markets exchange in some place like Europe or Asia. i think that definitely could happen."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: or maybe seashells [Seychelles? 17:19]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: exactly right. yeah. i mean i\u2019m in Taiwan right so i have had conversations with people here about having it listed in taiwan. and it would be a big jump for them \u2014 the regulators here are very conservative, but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s impossible."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: you write the Blockstream markets weekly newsletter, which is great. and i want to continue on that line of thought about institutional investors. but in your newsletter, you said that paul tudor jones kicked off the institutional phase of Bitcoin adoption. and i wanted you to expand a bit on that and what it means, and also i believe he said something about self-custody, and that is the best way to hedge against inflation. so maybe give us some of your thoughts on these.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah i think when he had that investor letter that came out i guess it was fourth quarter or third quarter of last year \u2014 institutional investors are not that dissimilar from retail investors, really. i mean they\u2019re very herdish and they look to see what their peers are doing. and a name like tudor when paul tudor jones wrote that in the investor letter that he thought Bitcoin was the probably the inflation hedge, i think that caught a lot of people\u2019s attention, so that helped really kick off the streak of institutional investment that we\u2019ve seen over the last 12 or 16 months, and i think there\u2019s something there \u2014 like the traditional investors are definitely investing on basically a pure inflation thesis, and that\u2019s something that i brought up a couple of times on other podcasts that we\u2019ve done. what are they missing, right? so paul tudor jones, they\u2019re looking at Bitcoin as a pure inflation hedge with a high beta kicker \u2014 that\u2019s how i describe it \u2014 because he calls it the fastest horse, but he says it\u2019s got the characteristics of gold but it\u2019s much smaller like we discussed yesterday, there\u2019s an ocean of institutional money that\u2019s trying to fit in a very small container and that will just drive price higher, so i think that\u2019s what he means by that. but i think he\u2019s right, like Bitcoin is definitely the inflation asset, and a lot of that is like there\u2019s tinder that has built up over generations, and COVID was this spark that got a fire going that accelerated all of these trends that are really massively beneficial to Bitcoin \u2014 and would have played out anyway \u2014 but covid and government response to covid and all the money printing and like authoritarian responses have really accelerated these trends in Bitcoin\u2019s favor. and i think the lightning network is probably something that these investors haven\u2019t quite factored into their models yet. so if you think back in 2016\u20132017, the narrative for Bitcoin went from peer-to-peer electronic cash to store of value and to enter digital gold, and i think what\u2019s going on in el salvador is shifting the focus back to electronic cash. so i think that application is not at all on the institutional radar, and i think that that could be massively disruptive and also big for Bitcoin in terms of network effects as well, and can push prices beyond what they\u2019re probably anticipating. and then i think also improved confidentiality and the ability to move value out of jurisdictions that impose ideas like unrealized capital gains \u2014 i think that will become increasingly valuable in the future, and i don\u2019t think investors have necessarily factored that into their thinking at all."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: yeah i think the the electronic cash narrative or aspect of Bitcoin is really about the bearer aspect of it, right? and i think that\u2019s why ptj is saying you need to hold your own keys, it needs to be in your own custody. but you can\u2019t have eCash without value, right? it can be a medium of exchange, but unless it has value, it\u2019s not going to be a good medium exchange.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah i think his point was \u2014 he was being asked about, What do you think about this futures-backed etf? and obviously it\u2019s not an ideal instrument, right? it doesn\u2019t track that great, it\u2019s not like a spot etf. there\u2019s a lot of additional costs on it and it\u2019s just easier, if you can, just to buy Bitcoin. why not buy the real thing and then have all the benefits, like you mentioned, of a bearer asset? the problem is that for a lot of institutional investors in the u.s in particular is that there\u2019s regulatory and mandate restrictions and they they just can\u2019t get access to it. if you\u2019re a fund you can\u2019t necessarily buy Bitcoin and self-custody it. but that this is one of the interesting things about Bitcoin, is that we as retail investors, as individuals, have that freedom, and we have a we have a big leg up on the institutional guys \u2014 who will eventually go that way \u2014 it\u2019s just going to take them years."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: all right let\u2019s shift gears a bit and talk a bit about Blockstream\u2019s acquisition of Adamant capital. so what was the goal to acquire that hedge fund? and what kind of products are we trying to build on Bitcoin and on Liquid?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah i i think the the Blockstream mining note \u2014 i look at it as like a massive icebreaker, right? that\u2019s just plowing the way for a lot of other things to come. it\u2019s a very unique product, as i mentioned, it\u2019s natively Bitcoin and i think it really bridges the gap between the old world and the new world, and i think it\u2019s something that traditional investors really want to invest in as well. i think the BMN will be a big part of driving broader liquid adoption and a slew of new assets and products that will be issued on on liquid. so in the Bitcoin space there\u2019s some really interesting yield-generation opportunities and some traditional arbitrage strategies that work really really well in this space. so i think what we\u2019re trying to do with the fund is to build on the momentum of the BMN and the broader Liquid adoption that we\u2019re seeing, and package up some of those strategies and offer them to investors in a pretty convenient way. so i think the most exciting version of the the strategies that we\u2019re looking to put into the fund are: if you can do it on liquid, if you can marry it to a token, if you can self-custody it, and if you could trade it either p2p or on something like Bitfinex securities. and i think that becomes really exciting. that\u2019s probably the best version i think of what we\u2019re doing and probably the end-goal for what we\u2019re trying to get to."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: gotcha. so you were one of the early Bitcoin adopters at Macquarie. maybe you can talk a bit about how we established a relationship with Macquarie at blockstream to do mining. why did they decide to work with Blockstream? and where we\u2019re going in that direction?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah. i think a firm like Macquarie, they obviously do a lot of due diligence on anyone they\u2019re going to work with, especially if it\u2019s in the public eye. and they\u2019re maybe for US listeners, they might not realize the scope of Macquarie, because they\u2019re not a big retail bank, but they are literally \u2014 in the infrastructure space \u2014 they are the whale of whales. they have the world\u2019s largest infrastructure fund. and so they have a lot of partners globally that they can select from. so there was quite a rigorous selection process that we had to go through, and i think it\u2019s a big credit both to the mining team and to Blockstream in general that Macquarie chose us to work with. so i think we should be extremely proud of that. and Macquarie is nimble. i think they\u2019re the tip of the spear probably relative to their counterparts in the US. so i think there\u2019s going to be a lot more very well capitalized players entering the mining space in the coming years, including sovereign states. so i know that we\u2019ve talked about this before, but there\u2019s a lot of noise coming out of central and south america. there\u2019s sovereign states that are investing in mining there. last week there was news that laos in Asia expected to make 200 million dollars next year from Bitcoin mining, so the space is changing very very quickly and i think while it\u2019s great to be chosen by people like Macquarie, that we also need to be very front-foot, and we need to be moving forward and chasing down opportunities to make sure that we don\u2019t get passed by some of these guys who are going to be very very well capitalized and pushing very aggressively to extend in the space. so that\u2019s a challenge for us."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: yeah it\u2019s funny how you mentioned like some people in the US are not that familiar with Macquarie. when that announcement first came out, i didn\u2019t hear that much from my friends on on this side of the world, but all the friends i have in Asia and australia, they pinged me right away and they said, That\u2019s huge! that\u2019s massive! i can\u2019t believe you got Macquarie! it\u2019s just there\u2019s a bit of an information divide here, but if you have a good grasp of everything around the world, who are the big players, then you see that this is where it\u2019s going. everything is going towards Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining and financial services built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah, and Bitcoin mining is a great one for those kinds of investors because it doesn\u2019t have all the issues of trading and messing around with fiat and all of those regulatory hassles that come with that. mining is \u2014 it\u2019s an infrastructure, it\u2019s a yield business, right? it\u2019s something that they\u2019re very familiar with. it\u2019s like running a waste treatment plant or something like that, where you do a big infrastructure build and then you earn back money over time. so that\u2019s something that those kind of players are very familiar with, and it\u2019s not that big of a leap for them."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: i think we\u2019re also very lucky at blockstream to have you because you were the key man on that deal bringing it in and getting it put together.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: well, that\u2019s why i get paid the big bucks, right?"}

{"prompt": "Samson Mow: so you\u2019ve been writing this Blockstream markets weekly newsletter since you started. let\u2019s talk about that for a bit. what is the the goal behind it? and is it a lot of work to do? and does it consume a lot of time? and do you get any good feedback from people saying, That\u2019s a great newsletter?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: no, not really. so i was a sales trader for years, and that\u2019s a big part of the job is every day you write market wraps. and i\u2019m in the habit of doing that and i think i would do it even if i didn\u2019t send it out, just because it helps me organize my thoughts and keep on top of what\u2019s going on. and that way when i\u2019m having a call with someone about the BMN or about Bitcoin or the market in general, that i have thoughts that are up to date and i have a view on the market and hopefully can add value in some way. but yeah the newsletter is something \u2014 it might be one of the longest running newsletters that nobody has ever heard about. so i started writing it at Macquarie because it was just decided internally that we needed to have something like that, like we needed to be up to date on the news and the price and stuff like that if we were going to try and push Bitcoin internally to senior management. so that\u2019s when i started working on it. so it\u2019s probably been going for geez four or five years running. and yeah it\u2019s just an effort to organize trading news and market trends, and occasionally take a stab at where i think prices is going. it is a ton of effort to write that, but i think it\u2019s useful and it helps me and hopefully it helps people looking at the Bitcoin space as well. definitely sign up."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: yeah definitely. and i think we can put a link. if we can\u2019t then cut this part out: medium.com/blockstream-markets-weekly. yeah i remember when you first started writing the markets weekly and i think you had a little piece of technical analysis there, like a flag analysis, and Adam commented and said, You shouldn\u2019t include TA in this thing. but it was just a funny argument that i witnessed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah no i\u2019m a pattern guy, i like a lot of those basic patterns and i think that they work very well in Bitcoin, so i think things like the pennants, the flags \u2014 i think Bitcoin is actually a very technical asset, and i think having worked in taiwan so long where taiwan markets are massively retail-dominated \u2014 like 70% of the trading volume here is retail \u2014 and because Bitcoin historically has been retail-dominated, i think there\u2019s a lot of spill over there. and the things that work in markets like taiwan and korea where there\u2019s so much retail participation, tend to work in Bitcoin as well. so that\u2019s something that i\u2019ve noticed. and people have different perspective on how they read the tea leaves, which essentially is what it is. so i do like the pattern stuff \u2014 i\u2019ve toned that down a little bit, i know Adam doesn\u2019t like it \u2014 so i\u2019ve toned that down a little bit. but i do like the statistical stuff too, is a lot of fun, and do reference a lot of the on-chain stuff, though i do have some question marks there on how accurate that stuff is at times."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: i don\u2019t know, for me none of that really matters. it\u2019s just gonna keep going up at varying rates.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah i mean i typically have an optimistic bullish bias, and people make fun of me for that in the note. but i\u2019ve been right \u2014 we\u2019re still going up. but you do have to have that in the back of your mind in Bitcoin that this is an asset that is still small, that has a lot of upside, the macro trends are all in its favor, there\u2019s very little institutional investment \u2014 that has to grow, you have the demographic things in its favor. i think everything points to it going bigger, so i think you have to have that in mind when you\u2019re looking at your timing. i think it makes sense just from a trading perspective to have your long-term HODL position and then have a discretionary trading position where you flip in and out. and yeah i think tactically like on the pullbacks, buying the dip \u2014 it works out \u2014 it makes sense."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: definitely. so looking forward, what are you most excited about in the world of Bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah i mean i think the world has changed a lot in the last two or three years. generally i think the overall trajectory is not great, but that\u2019s what got me into Bitcoin, and i think that broad-based acceptance of hard, censorship-resistant money can go a long way to fixing the world\u2019s problems. so that what motivates me to be in the industry, and that\u2019s what i look forward to seeing Bitcoin\u2019s contribution to the world in general. so i think it\u2019s that, and then a hundred-thousand price print by christmas would be nice as well."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: so basically your outlook is, Bitcoin fixes this?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah, pretty much. i think for a lot of things. yeah i mean, inflation is a massive problem and it has been for a long time, and that\u2019s one of those things where i feel like i\u2019ve been talking to people about that to investors for a long time and they\u2019ve largely dismissed it, right? so i can remember a conversation with an analyst in 2018 where i was talking about inflation and how it\u2019s a big problem for people on the street and i don\u2019t care what the fed says \u2014 it\u2019s a problem. and he says, Well cpi is low. and i said, Well my kids\u2019 tuition goes up every year. houses are only going in one direction. like, there is clearly inflation. and he said, Well i don\u2019t know what to say \u2014 cpi is just low. so inflation is a big problem and i think Bitcoin goes a long way to fixing that, for sure."}
{"prompt": "Samson Mow: definitely. well it\u2019s been a great chat, Jesse. and i\u2019ll give the show back to you next week.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: okay, thanks. i thought i was gonna have to look for another job there."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: So Christian maybe we can start off with a quick introduction: who you are, what you\u2019re working on and what\u2019s your role at Blockstream?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: yeah so i\u2019m Chris. i am what some people might call a Bitcoin OG. Idiscovered this paper in 2009 back when I was doing my studies at ETH Zurich, which then later became my phd topic. I had been doing my doctorate on scalability and the security of Bitcoin. and when it came time to go into the industry, Blockstream offered me to basically continue working on these topics and i\u2019ve been working on that ever since."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: good stuff. so high-level: what is the Lightning Network? what is the problem it\u2019s trying to solve? and how is that important to Bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: so fundamentally the problem that we have is that a blockchain does not scale indefinitely. Basically we are limited by the parameters not just of the Bitcoin blockchain but also of the network that we run on to a limited capacity that we can use. and going beyond that, which might be required for a global system such as Bitcoin for everyday purchases, might not be possible directly on the Bitcoin blockchain. so what we do is we try to make more efficient use of the limited capacity that we have by aggregating more and more transactions into very few on-chain transactions. and the way we do this is by creating off-chain contracts that can handle hundreds or thousands of transfers and whose on-chain footprint then end up being just single transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. so what we do is we open a persistent relationship between two endpoints called a channel. we do that by sending a certain amount of Bitcoin to a multi-sig address where both endpoints have to agree on what happens with these funds, otherwise these funds cannot be moved. and then we decide on how to divvy up these funds. what we can do is, if you and i want to open a channel, i can put in 10 Bitcoin and you can put in zero \u2014 so initially all of the 10 Bitcoins belong to me, but then i can decide to basically pay you a Bitcoin by agreeing on a new settlement of this off-chain contract where you get 1Bitcoin and I get 9. so we change how the Bitcoins are tallied up. and once we are happy with how we did that or I want to use my funds elsewhere, we take one of these agreements \u2014 the latest one \u2014 and settle it on the blockchain, freeing these coins again from this off-chain contract, and at the same time settling every single agreement that we have in the meantime with just a single transaction chain. so for us it\u2019s a way to aggregate many many thousands of transactions in a very small space. and besides that we have different trade-offs that we that we can also address later maybe."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: so are there any limitations on the Lightning Network at the moment? I remember before there used to be like a funding limit \u2014 the amount of Bitcoin that you could send between parties. and can you go both ways in transactions now?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: yes. The fundamental innovation that we had as compared to prior constructions like the simple micropayment channels was that we can move funds in both directions. With simple micropayment channels we were limited to forwarding only in one direction, because the way we were sort of disambiguating which state was to be settled was by the recipient choosing always the one where he had the maximum. With Lightning and later developments like Eltoo, we came up with mechanisms where we can actually enforce a later state without having to rely on these weak incentives to do so. As for limitations, yes we initially had a limitation about the number of Bitcoins you could put into a single channel, but that was much more to prevent people from pulling their life savings into a channel, and much less of a technical limitation. It is something that we added as a gentleman\u2019s agreement between parties to protect people that might be over-enthusiastic from getting really badly hurt. but you could always override that and we have since removed those limitations from the defaults."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: Exactly. so I guess fundamentally this is a scaling solution, and the focus I think on scaling in Bitcoin is certainly on Lightning at the moment. are there any other solutions to this problem? are there any other competing solutions, or is this the one at the moment?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: I think there are a couple of complementary solutions being tackled at the moment. it depends on how widely you define the Lightning Network suite of protocols."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: well even broader \u2014 to just scaling Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: yeah so there\u2019s definitely the class of off-chain protocols \u2014 L2, L3 or whatever you want to call them \u2014 where we are actually doing things off the blockchain, hence the name. And Lightning and other proposals certainly go into that direction where we anchor some predefined agreement on the blockchain itself and then we go into a separate room and do our trading back and forth and only when we want to settle, we go back to the blockchain and enforce what the agreement was that we settled. There is the Lightning Network as we have it today, there is a proposal such as Eltoo for different kinds of constructions for similar channels, there are discreet log contracts that try to do some more fancy stuff, there\u2019s multi-party channels, but all of these are based around the idea of setting aside some funds on-chain, immobilizing them such that the parties of the off-chain contract have to agree, and then mobilizing them again once this agreement has to be resolved. and that goes hand-in-hand with other attempts to increase the efficiency of the on-chain mechanisms: things like Taproot, things like cross-signature aggregation, where we make more efficient use of the capacities in the Bitcoin blockchain that we have to squeeze in ever more transactions into the existing space \u2014 this, without breaking backwards compatibility with existing client implementations."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah or even as I think you mentioned last time I mean eventually you know the 2017 scaling wars were about bigger blocks, or I guess Lightning Network fundamentally. so at some point bigger blocks do play a role in it as well i guess. is that correct?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: I think it\u2019s probably not correct to say that the 2017 scaling wars were about the block size. it was more about when should we actually consider a block size increase. i don\u2019t think that fundamentally everybody is against eventually increasing the block size. we might have to do that eventually. the problem is more when we want to do that and when we consider it safe to do so? and 2017 there were a lot of proposals that were showing up that there is capacity that we could use before making a breaking change, before potentially forcing a large chunk of the network off of the blockchain, before forcing participants that might currently be able to participate off of the network by imposing a higher computational burden and a higher storage burden. and it basically is about timing \u2014 it is not about a fundamental opposition to considering a block size increase. the problem is it being a breaking change, it should definitely be the last option we consider \u2014 not the first one \u2014 just because it looks simple. it definitely isn\u2019t simple."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: and what about Liquid? how does Lightning interact with Liquid?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: so depending on who you talk to, Liquid is also a L2 solution, and there the sort of counting gets a bit weird because you can actually have Lightning generally considered to be a L2 solution on top of Liquid. and then you have a L2 solution on top of a L2 solution \u2014 hence I usually go for off-chain contracts, because those don\u2019t infer an ordering. but Liquid can be used as a basis for off-chain contracts as well, and therefore most of the technology \u2014 if not all of the technology we build on Bitcoin \u2014 can be ported over to Liquid. and in fact, Liquid builds on the Elements project which is the experimental platform that Blockstream has been built on. and being this experimental platform, it is a way for us to verify that ideas work out, where we can test new features, and where we can do very interesting things before trying to back-port them into a more stable Bitcoin environment where we can then show the utility which we experimented on in Elements. and so SegWit for example is something that was first tested on Elements and where we could then take the results back to Bitcoin Core and have a very educated guess about how it should look like in the end. and so our implementation c-lightning works both on Bitcoin as well as Liquid \u2014 with LBTC \u2014 and yeah it just works."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: so outside of c-lightning, there\u2019s other competing implementations of Lightning, right? is that the right way to characterize it? is it competing? is it eventually like a winner-takes-all of this market? or does the whole pie grow together and they each have their own kind of niches?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: i\u2019m not seeing it as pure competition. it is more of a collaboration on interoperability, adding more perspectives to the specification effort. we come from very different places and different use cases that we\u2019d like to address, and sort of having this clash of visions ultimately ends up with a more complete and better system than if one of us would go it all alone. so on the specification and on the compatibility side we are very much collaborating. we are competing a bit on the feature side where everybody is coming up with their innovative use cases, with their more extended features and user interfaces and so on and so forth. but on the specification and compatibility side it\u2019s a very friendly process, and I think it\u2019s not going to be a winner-takes-all situation. we try to address very different markets \u2014 we do have very different trade-offs. with c-lightning for example we aim for being very lightweight on resources, allowing you to run on servers in a high-density environment, or on embedded devices with limited resources. whereas other implementations might target more of the mobile market or the desktop market. so I think everybody has their niche and we collaborate wherever possible and we compete a bit on the user experience."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: so where do you think we are in the development of Lightning? in terms of: adoption, ease of use, maturity \u2014 how early are we in into this and how much farther do you think we need to go before it gets really mainstream adoption?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: I think at the moment it is very much still a techies tool. you need to have quite a bit of experience, you have to have quite a bit of knowledge about the underlying workings, and the abstraction layers are definitely not quite there just yet. but the basics are working solidly. the adoption is already there, but I think before we can really talk about mass-adoption, we need to provide better abstractions, better user interfaces, and either make things more understandable or hide them below the covers such that I don\u2019t want to have to explain to everybody how a channel works or how to re-balance your liquidity \u2014 and that\u2019s even on top of all the knowledge you already have to have about Bitcoin\u2019s inner workings \u2014 now you also have to learn about channels and liquidity and re-balancing and how to find a path and onion-routing. it\u2019s a huge thing to learn, and so we\u2019d like to abstract away all of these details or automate them as much as possible, such that new users aren\u2019t confronted with this overwhelming piece of information that usually scares them away."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: but there are implementations \u2014 or the people who are adopting it quickest right now \u2014 I think of El Salvador, right? and the 70% of their population that\u2019s unbanked. these aren\u2019t tech-savvy people, presumably so how are they interacting with Lightning?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: so there\u2019s this dichotomy of users we have at the moment where the one side is very tech-savvy, they they know about all of the intricacies, and they have spent and invested the time to actually read up on this stuff. and it\u2019s a major investment \u2014 don\u2019t underestimate this. and the other side of users is where these users are using a provider that tells them, Hey, don\u2019t worry \u2014 we\u2019re taking care of everything! sadly, that also means that they\u2019re taking care of their security. and the classic Not your keys, Not your coins dictum of Bitcoin \u2014 it means that you are fully trusting this custodian to actually have your best interests in mind. so probably not the thing that we want to encourage, but for ease of adoption and reach that we can have to other users, it is probably the way that many people will go."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah I think that\u2019s probably likely. it seems that you kind of need a big exchange blow-up every cycle just to remind everyone of that Not your keys, Not your coins principle, and we haven\u2019t had one in a while so we might be overdue, knock on wood. one of the main criticisms you get of Bitcoin is that it\u2019s old tech, it\u2019s clunky, it\u2019s difficult for people like my parents or someone to use, and it\u2019s slow, right? so you do a transaction, it comes up as pending really quickly, but if you go back to december of 2017, you could have transactions sitting in the mempool for hours or god-forbid, days, waiting for them to clear. so how important a piece of the puzzle is Lightning to making Bitcoin that much easier for everyone to use, and to achieving its end-goal of \u2014 the white paper\u2019s behind me, the peer-to-peer digital cash \u2014 and hyperbitcoinization, and taking over the world?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: I think it\u2019s a very important piece of the puzzle. I mean I too want to have Bitcoin be a currency that we can use in a day-to-day scenario, and that has always been my view of this system that and why it\u2019s interesting to me ever since 2009. and so Lightning actually gives us the opportunity of having better trade-offs \u2014 or different trade-offs, let\u2019s say \u2014 to Bitcoin-on-chain transactions. besides the scalability multiplier that we already mentioned before, it also has different behavior. unlike on-chain transactions in Bitcoin, a payment on Lightning is final as soon as it is acknowledged by the recipient. so there is no waiting for confirmations \u2014 you can literally transfer Bitcoin over Lightning at the speed of light, and there is immediate finality. there is also a difference in privacy: when you use Lightning to transfer your Bitcoin back and forth, there is no permanent trace being left on the blockchain. what is left on the blockchain is an aggregate of millions of individual transfers, but not the individual transfer anymore. so, while buying coffee on the Bitcoin blockchain will leave a permanent indelible trace of my interaction with that coffee shop, in Lightning it is far far more difficult to disentangle the traces that are left on the blockchain by individual payments because they\u2019re all bunched up into the final settlement, and it might even be impossible. so only people that are directly involved in the payment itself have any idea that there is a payment that happened. and so we have scalability, we have real-time payments, and we have privacy. and for us developers, maybe it\u2019s interesting to see that doing off-chain contracts is also a way to add experimental features in a far quicker way than if we had to convince the entirety of the Bitcoin network to do an update because, Hey we have this cool idea, it might be worth trying it out, but now I have to go on a huge campaign to basically change the protocol. whereas if we go for off-chain protocols, we can have much quicker interactions, and only the parties that are involved have to even know about this experiment. and so over the last couple of years, there\u2019s a lot of experiments that sprung up from Lightning, to multi-party channels, to discrete log contracts, that would have been very difficult if we had to do that directly on the blockchain itself. because again, pushing changes down to the blockchain \u2014 a global consensus system \u2014 is really hard."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah, painful. so I think the use case of Bitcoin \u2014 we kind of touched on this \u2014 is different in different parts of the world, right? so interestingly, in the developed world it\u2019s store of value, it\u2019s an inflation hedge, it\u2019s speculation. and then in emerging economies it\u2019s more people actually using it to make payments and to do things like you would use money normally. so where do you see the growth for the Lightning Network coming from? I think in 2017 a lot of us assumed it was going to be through micropayments and social media, but the whole El Salvador experiment is really interesting to see it come up organically through people that actually are unbanked that really need this kind of technology. so where do you think the bulk of the growth is coming from maybe in the next five years?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: I certainly hope that this trend of rapid expansion from the people that need it most continues throughout the future. and I think El Salvador was definitely a big moment for the Lightning Network, because all of the sudden you had this confirmation that, Yes, this is actually working for the intended use case that we set out as Lightning developers all these years ago to basically build a system that brings back the cash nature, the payment nature, of Bitcoin. and so my hope is that we can actually help these communities to build an alternative payment system to what is clearly not working if there\u2019s like 70 percent unbanked \u2014 there is something wrong and we should address that."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: exactly, yeah. and it\u2019s exciting. I mean Bank the Unbanked is such a cliche but it\u2019s cool to see it developing in this way, and people who actually need it being able to put it to work \u2014 that\u2019s pretty cool. so do you see any issues though with the Lightning Network? I mean this is a very public prime-time test of the lighting network. do you see any issues? like technically is there anything that could go wrong when we\u2019re trying this experiment at scale?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: there\u2019s a lot of unknowns in here that we don\u2019t know how to steer at the moment, and how the network will react, so certainly the structure of the network and the evolution of the network being a network where we perform payments by following connections among the peers \u2014 unlike Bitcoin which is a broadcast medium \u2014 we actually have to use existing communication paths in this network. the structure is very much what gives both stability but might also create bottlenecks, and so we need to be very cognizant about these trade-offs and we have to make sure that we are not developing single points of failure, and so a steady incremental growth of the network is certainly desirable because it gives us time to evaluate the existence of bottlenecks and steer against them. whereas a sudden influx of millions of users might not give us time to react to these developments. and if we recreate single points of failure, what\u2019s the point, really?"}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah, okay. and do you see any indications of that now? is there any way to track this in real-time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: so there are certain measurements that we can perform. I myself have supervised a couple of student theses looking into how the structure of the network is evolving, how the structure of the network is looking like. we\u2019re talking about centrality measures that give us a clue about what paths might be taken in the payments \u2014 again we don\u2019t really have any visibility into what payments are performed on the network overall, but by looking at the structure of the network we can see whether there are single points of failure. and there are certainly some that have a very dominant role, but as long as we have alternatives \u2014 so if these if these participants go down in the network, we still have enough resilience in the network itself to take over the load. and so i have been quite happy with this redundancy \u2014 in a positive sense \u2014 here, of the network. but we will definitely continue to monitor that."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: and what about exchanges? i mean this is another big application that people used to talk a lot about. and I think to date only Bitfinex is the only exchange that\u2019s integrated Lightning so far. and even ones that have talked about it seem to be really slow in bringing it to fruition. why do you think that is? do you have any thoughts on that?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: the main issue is that usually either you are a trader that is swapping back and forth between a currency pair trying to time the market, or you are interested mostly in unidirectional flows. so either you are putting your fiat on an exchange and then getting your Bitcoin out, or you are putting your Bitcoin in and getting your fiat out. and the place where Lightning shines the most is where payments in both directions are almost balanced."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: so kind of net each other out\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: exactly, because then we actually can make use of the liquidity that is in a channel multiple times, amortizing the cost to actually set up the channel. and so for day-traders it\u2019s definitely something interesting where they can open a channel with an exchange once and then at the beginning of the trading day, or whenever they set up an order, they can push over just the amount that is required for their strategy over to the exchange, and at the end of the trading day, or when the order gets executed, they can pull back the funds to their side of the channel. and this minimizes the exposure to the custodial risk that an exchange might pose, right? if the exchange doesn\u2019t have control over your funds because the funds are actually in a channel and belong to you, then even the exchange getting hacked doesn\u2019t cost you any funds. but when you are the retail user that is making use of an exchange to swap in fiat for coins or coins for fiat then these channels don\u2019t get used as much. the utility that you get from going over Lightning is much reduced, and so there is less incentive to actually do that. and so i would definitely like to see a less trusted exchange, because you can actually pull the control of the funds from the exchange, and thus also reducing the liabilities an exchange might have \u2014 which I think is a positive for exchanges \u2014 but still retain the ability to exchange your funds at any point in time by simply swapping them in for funds on the exchange."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: now what about Taproot? that\u2019s another big one. what does the Taproot implementation mean for the Lightning Network?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: there\u2019s a couple of things that impact Lightning. first and foremost of course there is much less information that leak onto the blockchain. since Taproot allows us to hide even complex scripts inside of what looks ultimately like a singlesig address, you can hide a lot of the details about a Lightning channel inside of Taproot. ultimately Taproot will also enable us to have multisig that look just like a singlesig, and since all of these off-chain contracts basically started off with a multisig where the participants add the funds into a shared account, namely multisig, we will no longer be able to look at the blockchain and say, Oh that this is a two-of-two \u2014 it might be a Lightning channel \u2014 no, that trace is gone. and even for closes where we have a bit more complex scripts because we have to deal with, Oh this guy now behaved and this guy now is correct and there\u2019s a time lock and stuff like that \u2014 that will also be all hidden inside of taproot ultimately. so if you have a collaborative open and a collaborative close between agreeing parties, there will be absolutely no trace of the channel even existing other than somebody sent some funds over from one address to another. in addition, there is a lot of cool things we can do with the newly-introduced Schnorr signatures, which allow us to be much more efficient in how we use some of the primitives that we have in Bitcoin. for example, we have a couple of messages that require multiple signatures and multiple public keys and all of these can now be combined into a single public key and a single signature. and beyond that, the way we currently implement end-to-end security in Lightning payments is called hash-time log contracts (HTLCs). they have a bit of a downside in that they are recognizable by parties that participate in the network. so if i receive a forwarded payment for a hash H, and then i receive a second forward payment for hash H, i can see that they are the same payment. and with Schnorr, what we can do is we can use PTLCs (point-time log contracts) where this constant \u2014 these values \u2014 are changed over the course of a single payment. and so this collating of information is no longer possible, increasing not only the privacy but also but also making funds more fungible in the network."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: okay interesting. so it sounds like the main application is probably privacy, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: yeah. and size savings! don\u2019t underestimate size savings."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: and moving on: so Greenlight. blockstream recently announced greenlight. can you run us through what the thinking is on greenlight and what the benefits are and who the target audience is?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: yeah so like we said before, there\u2019s this dichotomy of users: when we have Lightning users we have the ones that really have invested time to read up and learn about all of the intricacies of running a Lightning node and they get their hands dirty to actually run their own Lightning node. then we have the vast majority of people that either don\u2019t have the time to invest or aren\u2019t just interested in the tech details that underlie this \u2014 and we shouldn\u2019t be forcing them to actually have to learn this to use them. and so we took this custodian model and said, Okay what if we strip them of the keys? what if they no longer have to have access to the keys? can we find a middle-ground where we can help users with the management of the infrastructure, the management of the nodes, without having access to the keys? and so adhering to the Not your keys, Not your coins principle, what we do is we can run c-lightning nodes on behalf of our users without ever having access to the funds that are underlying it. and so what we do is we provide a service that allows users and developers to spin up c-lightning nodes incredibly quickly \u2014 in less than a second you can have your c-lightning node up and running \u2014 but all the time retaining full control over the funds that you put onto that node. and we do that by having the node request signatures from an app on your phone, on your desktop, or on your hardware wallet, whenever it wants to move the funds. and the app can then independently verify that, Yes, this is actually sensible and the command that initiated this actually came from a from an authenticated user and not a hacked node. and so what we end up with is a system where we can help you manage your infrastructure, where we can manage your your channels for you. and you basically can reap the benefits of being a Lightning user much quicker than if you had to first learn all of the technical details to get to that point. and so our hope is that by showing users the benefits of Lightning before they have to invest all of that time, they will actually end up first of all seeing that this is something that they might be interested in, and later on invest the time to take on more control over their own infrastructure. and it is certainly our goal to have an easy on-boarding experience, provide the learning materials for you to upgrade your own knowledge, and eventually we want you to off-board into your own infrastructure. and for that we have built a variety of tools that we will make available for you to actually run greenlight on your device, or provide the same service for your friends and family. so it is basically our strategy of moving the education behind this first Aha moment and making it more palpable for users to to get started with Lightning."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: okay we\u2019ve got a couple of questions here from twitter as well. so three questions here. the first question is what will the Lightning network wallet Bitcoin payment user experience be like in 2030 relative to what it\u2019s like now?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: my hope is that it will be absolutely seamless. there should not be really a difference between Bitcoin on-chain and Lightning funds, simply because that is already confusing, right? i want to perform a Lightning payment but i have five Bitcoins on-chain and three off-chain but the amount is four. what can i do, right? and so we want to abstract away these differences by both introducing technology on the specification side with proposals such as splicing, and with swap services that allow you to do on-chain payments despite only having off-chain funds. and the idea here is that ultimately we end up with a single balance being shown to the user and the full balance can always be used for on-chained payments or off-chain payments, and you can basically decide on a whim. so that\u2019s certainly a hurdle that we\u2019d like to remove over time, and ultimately it should become as easy as approaching the point of sale and tapping your phone or tapping a device on it and be able to perform payments in just a matter of seconds \u2014 the entire payment flow that we\u2019ve gotten used to from centralized organizations but enhanced by more privacy and decentralization."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: that\u2019s great. so the next question is this user says that with c-lightning they currently only see the fee detail on a payment. is it possible to show all the routing details as well?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: the thing is that the way we currently store that information is such that we only have details about the difference between the amount that was paid and the amount that was initially sent. and so that is the fee that we pay to the network. we can of course add that information, but we have to gauge whether it is generally usable for users or whether this is just a very specific use case that maybe impacts just one or two users. this is because we don\u2019t want to require more resources from the systems that we run on, and storing more information increases the database size. and so it is always a trade-off between what we store, what we display, and how many user users actually have an advantage from it. that being said, I mean c-lightning does have very extensive plug-in infrastructure where we expose a lot of that information. and so it should be quite easy for medium to advanced users to build a plug-in that takes all of this information and stores it in a separate file so that they can then go and analyze that information after the fact."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: and why is that desirable? why would somebody want to see the routing details?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: it might actually be useful to determine whether certain channels in the network are something that are useful for users. and if a channel for example leverages higher fees than a parallel channel, we might still want to bias towards it, because in the past we\u2019ve seen that that is very reliable. and so this information can be used to optimize \u2014 over the course of multiple payments \u2014 the reliability, but also the speed of a payment. and so it is more of an advanced use case. not many people do hundreds or thousands of payments where this would become statistically significant, but for advanced users it\u2019s definitely an option to store and bias with that information as well."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: okay the next one: what steps need to happen before we can implement splicing in more wallets? and maybe you can explain what splicing is as well?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: so splicing is actually the thing that i mentioned before where we want to have a single balance that can be spent both on-chain and off-chain. so splicing basically boils down to having all of your funds in a Lightning channel \u2014 no funds on-chain at all. and when you want to perform an on-chain payment what you do is you coordinate with your counterparty to say, Hey i want to close this channel \u2014 part of the funds go one way, and then we reopen the same channel in the same transaction. basically what we do is we close \u2014 move funds out \u2014 and reopen the channel. since the funds that remain in the channel never touched a singlesig and were always under the control of both parties, we can be absolutely sure that this will eventually confirm on the blockchain. and so therefore we never have to wait for it to confirm in the first place \u2014 this way you can perform on-chain payments from off-chain funds. there is also the opposite direction where you can say, Okay i close this channel, i splice in funds from outside, and then i reopen this channel immediately. and there are a couple of reasons why you might want to do this. so for example, if you\u2019re a merchant and you have this channel that is very active but you don\u2019t have any funds on that channel anymore, you might want to add some funds from an on-chain address that you have somewhere else to bump up your spending capacity in that channel. or if it\u2019s a very active channel you can increase the capacity just to say, Okay we now can have a bit more in balance, we can now process larger payments, even though we didn\u2019t know that at the beginning and we didn\u2019t allocate these funds initially. so we currently have a proposal that is out there for other implementations to verify. it builds on Lisa Neigut\u2019s proposal for dual-funding which is also a proposal that we have on the Lightning specification. and it is just a matter of time until other implementations will pick this up and dissect it and propose changes, maybe. after all, this is the principle of the Lightning specification: that we want to have as many eyes on the specification as possible so we have to get the best trade-off in the end. and so once we get a feedback from other implementations, they might implement it themselves. and once we have at least two independently-implemented implementations, then we can go and actually take this proposal and incorporate it into the Lighting specification. so we always have \u2014 for any change that we want to have to the Lightning specification \u2014 we need to have two independent implementations that verify that first of all, all of the details are in there, and that the implementation is actually solid and doesn\u2019t break."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: great all right to wrap it up. looking forward, what excites you the most about the world of Bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: the world of Bitcoin \u2014 well i\u2019ve had quite quite a bit of excitement already!"}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: that\u2019s great, christian. really appreciate you doing this and taking the time to speak with us today.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Christian Decker: awesome yeah thank you so much for having me"}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: but first: what\u2019s your backstory? how did you get into bitcoin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah so my background is game development. and then by chance i got into the bitcoin industry. so my friend Bobby was running btcchina and i joined as an advisor originally, and then i got pulled into the COO role there and i was the COO for almost two years. and i was running the exchange and mining pool. so in the crypto space my background is exchange operations and mining. and then Adam poached me to Blockstream."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: Yeah people might not remember: btcchina was a huge player in the space back in the day. i think that was the first exchange in china, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah it was the first exchange. and then after gox imploded, basically everyone went to btcchina to trade, so it had a massive growth spurt and a massive influx of traders and volume."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: you guys had a giant mining pool too that i think you were involved in.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah so btcc pool was pretty big. i think at the top, we were like 20% of the network hashrate."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: okay, so the first topic i want to get to is china because obviously china is a huge part of this market and it\u2019s a little bit difficult for outsiders looking in to get an accurate gauge of what\u2019s happening in china. so what\u2019s going on in china? is mining just done for good in china now?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: well i think large-scale mining is probably done for good, at least in the near-term. it\u2019s hard to say what\u2019s going to happen down the road, but i know that most mining operations were shut down. like miners were basically forced out \u2014 they\u2019re evicted! and they even had to tear down their facilities, too, which is adding insult to injury, right? so they built massive high-quality mining operations, and they basically have to rip everything apart, take down the transformers and just like \u2014 get out. so that was pretty disruptive, i would say, and we saw it on the network hashrate: we saw a massive drop in network hash, and we still haven\u2019t quite recovered yet, actually."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah. so but what\u2019s the broader situation like in china? so you hear a lot of FUD on china, like otc desks getting shut down and the authorities coming to your house if you log into binance. and it\u2019s hard to separate the BS from what\u2019s actually going on \u2014 the signal from the noise. so can you still buy bitcoin in china?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yes! absolutely. all the news that comes out of china is typically sensationalized. media wants clicks and that\u2019s the stuff that gets you attention. so we can address it one by one: there was news that people logging into binance would get a call from the authorities, but that wasn\u2019t the case. i think it was a scam site and people would get a call afterwards being advised that you may be logging into a scam website \u2014 so that was kind of normal. and the other one was the ban on otc trading. so i think larger otc trading operations are getting some pressure to close down, but still like people can still buy bitcoin peer-to-peer on otc apps. and we haven\u2019t had exchanges proper for the longest time, so basically it\u2019s just larger-scale cryptocurrency trading operations are being clamped down on and closed, but spot-trading, otc trading, is still very much flourishing. and bitcoin actually is a protected asset in china. there have been cases in court where people have disputed ownership of bitcoin and it is deemed an asset category that you can seek legal protection on."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: okay. yeah i did a call last week with a big Taiwanese financial holding company and i got that question from one of their institutional investors. like, How can bitcoin possibly go higher without chinese retail? because they\u2019re very cognizant of the power of chinese retail. so it sounds like chinese retail is still in the market \u2014 we haven\u2019t lost them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah. i think there\u2019s an overemphasis on the importance of the chinese retail market, but i think it\u2019s obvious now that it\u2019s not the only market-mover, right? so the doge phenomenon was not china-driven. it\u2019s north american-retail driven, and it can pump that coin up to close to a dollar, and it shows you like \u2014 there\u2019s money all around the world, and it\u2019s not necessarily one region or country that is going to be driving things."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: what do you think motivated this latest crackdown in China?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: you mean the mining crackdown, right?"}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah i totally agree, and i worry about that. and that\u2019s one thing that i liked is that there was another big mining base in a competing economic center, right? so that they could like neutralize each-other out. so i think it is actually \u2014 it\u2019s better in some ways, but it\u2019s concerning in other ways as well, you\u2019re totally right. what about the supply chain? because hashrate is now very geographically distributed, but we\u2019ve got a big bottleneck in the supply chain for mining rigs. the three big guys i guess are microbt, bitmain, and canaan, and all their manufacturing facilities are in china. do you think at some point it could extend to a supply chain crackdown?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: so i think a lot of the components for manufacturing miners \u2014 not the chips per se, but general \u2014 the chassis and other things like that, are still built in china. so there is some risk there, but i don\u2019t see it as mission-critical. if there was ever any problem, then new centers would just come up and manufacture elsewhere."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah. and then the components around the chips are \u2014 that\u2019s not rocket science, right? the chips are from south korea and tsmc, so you\u2019re right \u2014 i guess that could be made anywhere.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah. i\u2019m thinking like more commodity things like fans, cables, connectors, the metal chassis, and all that stuff, so yeah \u2014 all that stuff can be made elsewhere. it\u2019s not mission-critical."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: all right. so we\u2019ve had a good bounce in hashrate since this crackdown and a massive difficulty adjustment i think has helped with that as well, but it looks like some of the chinese hardware is already starting to find new homes in different parts of the world. where is that chinese hardware going? and has hashrate bottomed now, do you think?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: i think we\u2019ve bottomed out. i think we\u2019re going to see it slowly come back online from. what i gather, it\u2019s mostly going to russia and russia-adjacent territories, like kazakhstan is a popular destination. and also north america. but i can see more and more places opening up. like south america is looking promising, too. and central america with el salvador volcano mining, so i think it\u2019s just a matter of time before the hashrate comes back online, it\u2019s just going to take a good chunk of time, because rebuilding all those facilities and all that infrastructure is not something that\u2019s just going to happen overnight. that\u2019s going to take months. and things don\u2019t get built as quickly as they do in china, so it could be six months, eight months, before we really bring back all the hashrate."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: and there\u2019s probably going to be some slippage too. like i think there\u2019s probably some older equipment that was operating in china that people just thought, Okay it\u2019s not worth me moving this to kazakhstan or north america, and they just bin it, right? so there might be some slippage and hashrate might take a while to get back to the previous level.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah. anytime you have a mass migration like that, i think you will see that slippage, just because things will break in transport. when you\u2019re taking tearing down all the infrastructure and pulling the miners off the shelves, things are just going to break. and like you said, some of the equipment is not worth transporting, so they might just keep it in china and wait until things cool down a bit, and they might restart some mining operations, but maybe more low-key, smaller operations. nothing massively industrial \u2014 which is good for bitcoin i think, in the end."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah so shifting gears towards STOs. i think this is another really interesting application, and another market that\u2019s massively set for disruption is like traditional capital markets. and so you mentioned at the beginning that you\u2019re also the ceo of pixelmatic, a gaming company, and one of the few companies in the world i think that has actually executed an STO issuance. so why did you choose to go the STO route? what are the benefits you see for companies?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: well i think STO\u2019s are going to drive the reformation of traditional capital markets. the benefits are largely what we make them out to be: if you do STOs on your average blockchain with no dimension of privacy, then there\u2019s nothing really improved about it, right? i think, if done right, it will be done on something like Liquid, and this is why i spearheaded the Blockstream AMP product at Blockstream, because Liquid has confidential assets and confidential transactions, so it\u2019s just the perfect platform to do security tokens on. i think if you\u2019re just tokenizing something on an inefficient platform that doesn\u2019t offer privacy, then it\u2019s not really anything better. we need something to be 10x better than the legacy system in order to win market share. and i think we\u2019re reaching this point where people are starting to realize that the traditional system is broken, not just because you\u2019re only trading five days a week during working hours minus bank holidays, but it\u2019s the fact that the platform itself can say \u201ccan you please stop trading now?\u201d, which is weird right? so with a security token, there is no central party that can say, Stop trading. so for example the BMNand the exo token for infinite fleet \u2014 those things can be traded peer-to-peer. you don\u2019t need the permission of someone else to trade them, because they\u2019re tokenized and as long as all the investors are whitelisted on the Blockstream AMP platform, then peer-to-peer trade is just a native part of that that system."}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah that\u2019s really exciting. and I agree i think that\u2019s just a massive opportunity. so one of the reasons i like working in the space is because you get to be on the cutting-edge of things and you get to look at a lot of really interesting things. so i think without giving away too much of the secret sauce, i\u2019ll put the ball in your court to how much you want to reveal \u2014 but what do you think about STOs in the next 12 months? i feel like there\u2019s some massive things coming, and i think this could be really a big year for STOs. is there anything you feel you can share on that?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah i think there\u2019s probably three dimensions to it that are required before they\u2019ll really take off: one is a trading venue, or trading venues. and we see that with INX, right? they raised a lot of capital, they\u2019re rolling out their platform, they finished their acquisition of open finance, and basically they can start offering security tokens now. and then i know there\u2019s a couple other exchanges, one really large exchange that is going to be launching a security token exchange. and once these venues are in place, then i think it opens the door for this market. so venues are one part. the second part is the technology. and like i touched on, it\u2019s building on top of something like Liquid that offers this additional benefit of privacy and confidentiality. like, you don\u2019t want the platform to shut you off, but you also don\u2019t want them to trade against you, and that\u2019s pretty much what those platforms do \u2014 like Robinhood sells your data to someone else. with Liquid, then, you don\u2019t have that problem. so no one can see what you\u2019re trading. and then the third thing really is the regulatory landscape. and in the us, that\u2019s opened up a lot. you have Reg Afilings that are not as difficult to get through. you also have Reg CF which has been largely expanded. basically the regulator in the US, they want people to be doing these things rather than illegal security offerings and ICOs and the like. also in luxembourg \u2014 which is where we\u2019re doing EXO and the BMN\u2014 the regulatory framework is also quite effective too and efficient, that lets us get these things out the door rather soon relatively, right? so i think with these three pieces, we can start to see a big growth spurt in STOs, and i think people have to see the potential of it and see projects successfully completing capital raises, and then the floodgates will open and everything will change"}
{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: yeah it\u2019s a it\u2019s a huge opportunity. i think in in taiwan where GDRs (global depository receipts) used to be really big as a way to let foreign investors invest in this market. it\u2019s the same thing, right? it opens it up to global investors and i think it\u2019d be a really really big deal. all right so moving into nfts. i mean stos i get completely, but NFT\u2019s are something i\u2019ve struggled with a little bit to get my head around. but there\u2019s a ton of interest, right? on the issuer side so nba nike marvel they all want to issue NFT\u2019s. so what\u2019s the opportunity here for issuers and for investors or collectors or the other side of that trade?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah so i also i see your your point about nfts and i think a lot of people from the bitcoin space are like, i don\u2019t really want to touch this stuff, or, i don\u2019t like it. and i think that has to do with it being over-hyped. and the ethereum side hasn\u2019t really done much to mitigate that hype, right? they like the hype. and you see things like the $69 million dollar nft sold, but i think that\u2019s all noise. the real potential here is opening up trading and tokenization. so again: i think nfts, there is some merit to it if it can confer some benefit to end users. so i\u2019ll take infinite fleet as an example: we\u2019re making all the spaceships as nfts. and the game currency is also a crypto asset. so what you can do is an atomic swap on Liquid where you can trade these things without involving us \u2014 the game, the platform \u2014 and just do it peer-to-peer, and there\u2019s no risk, right? the the trade either executes or it doesn\u2019t. so you can alleviate the problem of games in the past where, if you\u2019re like buying game currency or trying to sell an item, you have to send it to the guy first and then get a payment on paypal or something else afterwards. so i think there needs to be some sort of benefit to using it, and i think we need to really present the benefits and not oversell it. like most nft games or nfts in general, they\u2019re like, Yeah you own this thing now! but if you read the terms of service, you actually don\u2019t. so if you read the terms of service for Topshot it\u2019s like: you can go to our app and buy it and sell it and look at it here but you can\u2019t do anything with that thing. but if you look at their marketing, it\u2019s all, You own this now! you own this moment! so it\u2019s very misleading, right? i think maybe that\u2019s what irks bitcoiners."}

{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: okay el salvador. this is something that i didn\u2019t think we\u2019d see this cycle. like i didn\u2019t think in this cycle we would see sovereign adoption. and i thought that if we did see sovereign adoption in this cycle or the next cycle, it would be some non-g7 country buying bitcoin and putting it on their balance sheet. but a country coming out and saying Hey bitcoin is legal tender \u2014 that exceeded all my expectations for probably the next cycle, let alone this cycle! so i feel like this has the potential to be a massive domino effect, because there\u2019s so many dollarized economies in south america, even in asia, and also in africa. and it\u2019s definitely not being reflected in the bitcoin price at the moment. i guess we\u2019re in a downtrend so we just shrug off good news. but what do you think the opportunity is for bitcoin in these dollarized economies like el salvador?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: so i think it\u2019s really a lifeline for them, right? because right now they\u2019re using another country\u2019s currency. they\u2019re using the us dollar. and they get none of the benefits from the money printing. when money printer goes BRRRR, the bankers and the rich people in the us \u2014 there is benefit to them, right? they can have access to capital, they can take out cheaper loans, there is some economic stimulus component to it where infrastructure gets built and things theoretically should get better. but all these other countries, there\u2019s nothing for them. there\u2019s no direct benefit to them other than the erosion of people\u2019s earnings, because they\u2019re still earning dollars and they\u2019re not getting that direct first-order benefit from the money printing. so i think bitcoin is a safe-haven for them. if they can slowly unhinge from the us dollar and anchor to bitcoin, then when they earn a dollar worth of bitcoin, they\u2019re basically earning the same dollar as michael saylor would earn right you\u2019re on fair and even footing with the rest of the world. so i think the potential there is really just making the world a more equitable place. and that\u2019s what bitcoin will help them do."}

{"prompt": "Jesse Knutson: so i guess the plan in el salvador at the moment is bitcoin is basically in the background in terms of the lightning network, right? like things will be priced in us dollars to reduce the bitcoin volatility, and you\u2019re just using bitcoin as the background tool to facilitate that transaction. is that correct?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Samson Mow: yeah at least right now. but down the road potentially there\u2019s more applications of bitcoin. this has been in the news a bit \u2014 they could issue bonds. and part of those bonds could be denominated in bitcoin. and over a long time horizon \u2014 like five to ten years \u2014 that could be a significant benefit to the country if they did have these bonds with a bitcoin component. so that\u2019s all tbd and we\u2019ll see where it goes, but i believe there is strong interest on their part to do these kind of financial offerings."}

{"prompt": "Adam Back: Hi. First time, first episode of Blockstream\u2019s podcast, okay.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: Yep the genesis episode. So, what I want to focus on today is kind of the Adam Back backstory. How you got into Bitcoin and the early days of Bitcoin, the history of it. Because I think for a lot of people like myself that maybe came in a little bit later, that\u2019s really interesting context and I think often there\u2019s a bit of color on the trends and challenges that are playing out today in Bitcoin, that maybe some of the people newer to this space aren\u2019t as aware of. So jumping into it, you know Bitcoin is really interesting \u2014 I think one of the things that\u2019s interesting about it is that you see a lot of patterns and topics just constantly get recycled, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because of the cyclical nature of the halving cycles or what, but Nic Carter has the FUD dice, Fidelity has the 6 Common Criticisms of Bitcoin\u2014there\u2019s probably up to 10\u201320 now \u2014 but one of the mainstays is that Bitcoin is old tech, right? And so you often hear people criticize it and say that they\u2019ve got something newer or better, and I think basically the base of that criticism is that the first iteration of something is not typically the best, and it\u2019s not the one that usually ends up surviving and winning in the end. So people who often make that criticism probably don\u2019t know much about the evolutionary history of Bitcoin, and some of the Bitcoin-like digital currencies that came before it like eCash, b-money and that kind of stuff. So I was wondering if to start it off, maybe we could talk a little bit about the evolutionary history of Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: Yeah, of course there are wider, generic technologies that are required like public key cryptography, hashing functions and things like that, and I think the Bitcoin white paper may be slightly about those things like ECDSA and the digital signature algorithm, but skipping those, which are very widely known and sort of generic underpinnings for a lot of Internet security \u2014 and bear in mind also, Bitcoin doesn\u2019t directly use anything very esoteric for the most part \u2014 which is a good thing. In cryptography, you don\u2019t want to do new invented cryptography building blocks or get too creative like that because it\u2019s fragile, and if you\u2019re not an expert in it, you will tend to end up making a mistake. And it would be doing superficially the right thing, but it would make mistakes, so being conservative and not too adventurous with the technology building blocks and understanding how to combine them is key. So then in terms of electronic cash, precursors, and building blocks, there was a lot of interest to have electronic cash on the Internet, and certainly in the early \u201990s there wasn\u2019t many of the things we have today like PayPal, which are superficially \u2014 anybody can sign up, typically \u2014 it\u2019s much easier to access [nowadays]. At that time, you needed to be a merchant processor, and it was pretty difficult to get one of those \u2014 it would all be covered in KYC, and you\u2019d have to pay with a credit card or a debit card and not everybody has one of those globally. So it was a pretty balkanized, restricted, and cumbersome payment system that was available, and most people weren\u2019t using it other than to buy things, or for bigger stores to sell things. So people were interested to have something more Internet-native for electronic cash\u2014and for that to have privacy like physical cash. And so actually the first \u2014 as far as I am aware \u2014 privacy-enabling piece of electronic cash technology was by David Chaum, which was his blind signature technology. So it\u2019s actually quite an elegant and simple-looking piece of cryptography once you see it, but a lot of people think about it as the benchmark like, This is possible. So after that there were many academic papers incrementally improving on that. So I think you can scroll forward from that to early to mid-\u201990's\u2014Chaum had formed a company called DigiCash. They\u2019d actually developed the technology as a central server model\u2014as almost all of those electronic cash protocols were \u2014 so unfortunately you were relying on a server as a single point of failure that, if the server would go offline, or the company operating it would go out of business, all the electronic cash tokens would effectively disappear, because the double-spend device tracking which coins were spent was on the server. And so that in fact happened with DigiCash. They set up a demo server \u2014 I probably have some unspent coins on a backup somewhere but you can\u2019t prove that they were spent or not at this point. And so that caused \u2014 it focused people\u2019s attention on the fact that the single point of failure was an issue and so the next electronic cash systems were more decentralized in nature \u2014 reactive to that, basically. So in 1997 I proposed Hashcash as a sort of micropayment system to get around the problem that it\u2019s difficult for people to pay and it\u2019s not very decentralized because there are merchant processors and things like that. And DigiCash in particular was sort of integrated with banks. That was the way that they saw that working, and so they relied on permission, effectively. So they had a demo server that issued some free tokens and people like the cypherpunk set about trying to sell things like t-shirts and stuff like that for these tokens to see if they could bootstrap a value \u2014 because they were supposed to be limited in number \u2014 but part-way through that experiment the company went under and the database went offline. So from there I proposed Hashcash. And the thing that enabled it to be more decentralized was that there was no central database, so it was more scalable, but it wasn\u2019t respendable or redeemable. So it was created in an electronic world \u2014 it was mined \u2014 so you didn\u2019t need an interface to buy coins. They had a cost to create, so it satisfied part of the equation. It didn\u2019t satisfy transferring value to the recipient, but it satisfied that it cost the sender something. So it became a kind of postage stamp for anti-spam, denial of service, and things like that. But immediately after I proposed it, it seemed to to cause many people to see an analogy with physical gold, like that this is digital gold, and to try from there to work out how to make it respendable. So all kinds of ideas were brainstormed. Lots of mailing list posts on the cryptography and cyberpunks\u2019 lists brainstorming about how to do this \u2014 over a period of years, actually. Some of them anonymous, because the cypherpunks were interested in privacy and remailers and things like that. And actually the the Hashcash system was partly reactive to spam in the remailer network. I was running a remailer at that time and people would spam through it, so it was a way to preserve privacy while combating spam as well. So in any case then the the two major protocols around that time \u2014 so it\u2019s like a year later, 1998 \u2014 Hashcash was in 1997, were by Wei Dai with b-money and Nick Szabo with Bit Gold and they were both using this kind of \u201cmine the coins using hashcash\u201d but then work out an outline of how that could form a decentralized, respendable, electronic cash system. So they both had the concept of a broadcast ledger that was verified by many nodes but they were not quite implementable. There were details to work out and there was a bit of human invention involved like supernodes or a group of supernodes like a federation that would have to decide periodically what the difficulty should be. Or in Bit Gold\u2019s case it was just assuming that people would create coins as they wished, and if a lot of coins were created in a period \u2014 well I think he was calling those stamps \u2014 so people would create a lot of stamps in a period so that you could create as many or as few as you wanted. And if there was an interval where a lot were created they would be considered not very scarce, and then you\u2019d have a specialized market to assemble rare and common stamps into a standardized-value coin. so apparently this happens in stamp collections: there are market makers that assemble standard values. so he had that kind of thinking, but there was a lot of human involvement there. so in terms of what held that back? i think it was the human involvement in that and of course it didn\u2019t get implemented for related reasons. so the next bit of deployed technology actually was RPoW (reusable proof of work) by Hal Finney and that one actually didn\u2019t directly solve that difficulty problem \u2014 it still had the same problem. but it was a kind of combination of Chaum\u2019s server, so it had financial privacy, whereas Wei Dai\u2019s b-money and Nick Szabo\u2019s bit gold i think had similar privacy trade-offs to Bitcoin, in outline. so Hal Finney\u2019s had much stronger privacy but it was centralized, and he used this \u2014 at the time \u2014 new type of hardware which is so-called trustworthy computing hardware.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: I was going to say \u2014 so there\u2019s a lot of projects and effort that came in before [Bitcoin]. do you see it as like an incremental improvement on these previous efforts or is it a big leap forward?"}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: I mean i think it solved a couple of key problems that people hadn\u2019t figured out how to solve, and i think given the cypherpunks, particularly Hal Finney and some of the others were implementers, if they had figured out how to solve their missing problems they would have rushed off and implemented it. so i think the point is that bitcoin\u2019s design did solve some key problems and i think the big one is the difficulty adjustment mechanism. basically the previous systems \u2014 i mean it sounds simple in hindsight \u2014 but these things never are. if you were trying to find a solution to something and hundreds of people that are interested can miss something and then when you see the solution you\u2019re like, Oh well that looks simple \u2014 why did nobody think of that? and that\u2019s just the way it works. so i think that the previous systems try to target a stable price, generally [and not a variable price]. so those systems had too much human involvement and so bitcoin was able to define something that could be fully validated by a distributed system \u2014 an automated system with no human involvement \u2014 which is that it can control the rate of supply and then just leave it to the market to determine the price, and the price will be what it is. and so with that, in a different way of looking at it, it becomes possible to make an automated system.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: and of course there\u2019s this supply curve and issuance schedule."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: right. i mean there\u2019s quite a bit of ingenuity i would say in the details of that, but i think basically if somebody had popped up on the cypherpunks list and said, Look! do this, it might have been enough for other people to fill in the details. i have a suspicion, because some of the design problems are established computer science problems, so a lot of people have heard at this point about a byzantine generals problem and so that is basically a coordination problem in a distributed system. but it works with an identified set of participants and so you have to have [a known] identity, and the problem in a permissionless distributed system is there\u2019s no central party that you can trust to issue identities \u2014 one per computer, one per human, something like that, right? and so you get the Sybil attack: i.e. that one person could pretend to be a million people and gain some advantage. so it it seems to me that \u2014 i\u2019m sort of guessing at their thought process \u2014 but if you connect the thought process that led Satoshi to using proof of work both for mining/creating coins and to processing transactions in the network, could be that if you look at it (so that there are some other systems that use hashcash for creating pseudonyms, so you have the same problem with domain names and handles in chat systems things like that, which is: people will come along and take all the names if they\u2019re free and so you want to put a cost and so there were some systems that didn\u2019t use credit cards but used hashcash proof of work to reserve names just to make it expensive to take all the names) yeah so it seemed to me that you could bridge the distributed system that is Bitcoin (now this is sort of like looking at it in hindsight how that thought process might have occurred \u2014 nobody knows why or how but this seems logical right?) so if you look at it, the byzantine generals problem has identities and you\u2019ve got a system without identities, and if you look around there are people using hashcash proof of work to have a cost to create identities. so if you assemble the two things together, you make each node do some work to get an identity and then it can participate in a normal byzantine generals problem for like one block, and you can do it again. and if you\u2019d arrived at that combination you might realize, Well maybe you don\u2019t even need identities! you can just sort of anonymously do work proportional. so anyway that is finally the way that bitcoin works \u2014 so this is some supposition [after the fact], i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually how that was arrived at. so i think bitcoin started from a different direction which is: it provided a working decentralized solution. but i think people sometimes have the intuition that the first version of a technology is a kind of prototype and has a lot of room to improve and that\u2019s generally a reasonable assumption i would say. but surprisingly it seems that there\u2019s something unusual about bitcoin! so in 2013 i spent about four months of my spare time trying to find any way to appreciably improve bitcoin across scalability, decentralization, privacy, fungibility, making it easier for people to mine on smaller devices, get more of those coins \u2014 like a bunch of metrics that i consider to be metrics of improvement. and so i looked at lots of different [options]: changing parameters, changing design, changing the network, changing cryptography, and i came up with lots of different ideas, some of which have been formally proposed by other people since. but basically to my surprise it seemed that almost anything you did that arguably improved it in one way made it worse in multiple other ways. so it made it more complicated, used more bandwidth, made some other aspect of the system just objectively worse. and so i came to think about it that: bitcoin exists in a narrow pocket of design space \u2014 i mean the the design space of all possible designs is an enormous search space right? \u2014 and counter-intuitively, it seems like you can\u2019t really significantly improve it. and bear in mind, i come from a background of like, just out of phd in distributed systems, and i spent most of my career working on some large-scale internet systems for startups and big companies and security protocols and things, so i feel like i have a reasonable chance \u2014 if anybody does \u2014 of incrementally improving something of this nature. and basically i gave it a shot and concluded, Wow \u2014 there\u2019s literally, basically nothing. everything you do makes it worse, which was not what i was expecting! i was like, Great! let\u2019s improve the privacy, improve the fungibility, make it easier to mine on small devices, make it so that you can participate in mining in a very minimal way without needing to use a pool, and like basically nothing appears to be possible. and so that\u2019s not what people expect, but they haven\u2019t gone through this process. they don\u2019t have this realization. so when people say that all these altcoins, they don\u2019t have any innovation \u2014 i mean that\u2019s actually a grounded statement \u2014 like it\u2019s actually true. in the sense that: they wanted to do an effect, so they cut some corners, made some trade-offs, and they did it anyway, and each of them is typically objectively worse, typically much worse, because of all the network metrics and so on, right? so they\u2019re de facto less decentralized, or make the system much more complicated. i think a lot of people don\u2019t realize that complexity is bad for security and dependability. so anyway that\u2019s a kind of counter-intuitive situation. so it\u2019s certainly not that anybody in the bitcoin technology space is anti-innovation or that bitcoin is old technology. i mean i think for example people have the wrong intuition that bitcoin just ran [as is] from the beginning. in fact the software has changed remarkably: like being refactored, rewritten, optimized, the network protocols optimized. i mean the initial sync time \u2014 when you start a new node and sync \u2014 has been completely redone like four times and is 10,000x faster than it was at the beginning. so you can still sync an old node but people\u2019s intuition that, Oh the code base is not changing \u2014 it\u2019s just wrong. you can look at the code base and see that it\u2019s one of the most active open source projects in existence by code changes and contributor metrics and things like that. and it\u2019s certainly the case for the robust R&D as well \u2014 that a lot of R&D comes out of the bitcoin and the associated space. so i think sometimes bitcoin suffers from like not having a marketing department. there is no bitcoin: the company, there\u2019s no funded bitcoin communications or coordinated marketing. and so anything that is discussed is discussed in the open so people get to see it, see the trade-off discussions. so [bitcoin] doesn\u2019t really stand up for itself, right? and so it\u2019s a little disappointing when people claim that bitcoiners are toxic or that bitcoin is stagnant because the facts are actually inverted: it\u2019s just that there\u2019s no marketing department out there explaining these kind of computer science backgrounds and technical reality things.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: so when you saw that, that satoshi solved for that problem, when did it strike you that bitcoin could be a big deal? and did it seem very far-fetched that it could become what it is today? or did you see at that time that, wow this could be a really big deal that could challenge legacy financial systems and the way countries operate and all the things that we talk about that seem actually not that far away now?"}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah well i mean they seemed a lot further away at the time. and yeah so i heard about it through probably having the first email from satoshi nakamoto just asking [me] about the citation for hashcash and i sent him a few papers and things. i thought the technology was interesting but the question mark was, Would it bootstrap? and it took a few years before there was an exchange at all, right? i mean i wasn\u2019t involved in like pre-2013 really, other than these early communications and looking at the news once in a while. there was a big question mark about whether it would bootstrap, and the people involved were presumably mining. i think mining is a big part of the bootstrap story because there\u2019s a psychological phenomenon where people ascribe value to something that they put ingenuity and effort into, even if it doesn\u2019t have a direct value. it\u2019s kind of like people do some craft or some art or in this case figuring out how to configure this clunky, hard-to-configure software that\u2019s doing mining, right? it wasn\u2019t very point-and-click. so anyways i think that it took a while to bootstrap, and that was my question mark: would it bootstrap? and then i would say clearly it did at some point, right? it reached a dollar. i think that was a kind of wake-up call for a lot of people that it\u2019s bootstrapping, it\u2019s still around and it\u2019s reached a dollar. Wow! that\u2019s something. so because i was familiar with the previous electronic cash systems, bitcoin makes some quite different trade-offs. so, in particular the security model takes a bit of getting used to, because in the other systems you have a very high security model where it\u2019s kind of like breaking digital signatures or something \u2014 you need an enormous amount of compute, so it\u2019s unrealistic to attack it. but the trust model assumptions in those systems are that there\u2019s a trusted central server. so the academics that came and looked at bitcoin took a while to be convinced that this was a plausible design, because the security model was basically that the good guys have more hashrate than the bad guys. so like 50/50, or at least equal cost in attacking the system is defending the system. and usually with public key cryptography \u2014 which is the norm with other electronic cash systems \u2014 the defender has an enormous advantage, just like an unimaginable advantage. so it\u2019s almost impossible to do anything to it on the attack front, except for the fact that they\u2019re a central server, so the central server is like a point of failure or in many cases has to be trusted as well, so it\u2019s a trust problem.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: so after discovering bitcoin in 2013-ish and being exposed to it earlier, why didn\u2019t you do what so many other people have done and make a trivial change to it, split it off, become hideously wealthy and do adam back coin? why did you decide to build on bitcoin and to contribute to bitcoin? other than the obvious like morality and integrity issues!"}
{"prompt": "Adam back: and so i thought about this and I had quickly come to the realization \u2014 i mean they were asking some interesting technical questions so i answered some of those things \u2014 but then it occurred to me like, Well wait a minute: why do they want me to be involved? it\u2019s probably because they want you to put your name on it for marketing purposes! i was like, Well that\u2019s kind of not very ethical, it\u2019s kind of renting your name, it\u2019s gonna burn your reputation and they\u2019re gonna get the money from it \u2014 or most of it. so it\u2019s like well firstly this is illogical: if you were going to contemplate immolating your reputation, you\u2019d at least want to take the money from it not have somebody else market it, right? so i was like, Well, i guess you could do that. and so in the course of about like 10 or 15 seconds i went through the thought process of, Well you could just fragment this amazing piece of technology and create a new one, make some money \u2014 but actually that would detract from the network effects, it would be kind of destructive. and the constructive thing to do \u2014 and ethical thing to do in my mind \u2014 is to improve bitcoin, because money is a network thing and this is not a serious endeavor to do this. it\u2019s opportunistic leeching kind of behavior. so it was resolved immediately: Okay, that\u2019s evil \u2014 i won\u2019t even consider that ever again kind of thing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: at what point did altcoin people start reaching out to you? was it like five minutes after [Bitcoin] had its first one dollar print?"}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: i don\u2019t think so. i think it was when i joined the bitcoin talk forum, because i guess there\u2019s a section of it \u2014 even though it\u2019s bitcointalk \u2014 for announcing altcoins, because they have a spam problem, there\u2019s an enormous incentive. it\u2019s kind of like email spam, right? it\u2019s an enormous incentive for people to market their coins. and so i guess to control the spam they made a separate \u2014 isolate it: like, you couldn\u2019t stop them, so they made an isolated alt section so at least they would keep the alt advertisements over there. so yeah i don\u2019t know. i guess they could have probably figured out how to email me, but as i was on the forum, that was when somebody contacted me about alt coins.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: how early was that? that was like 2013 when the altcoiners started coming around?"}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah it\u2019s 2013, yeah. i wasn\u2019t really tracking it, but i think there was a period where there weren\u2019t many altcoins and then it really became a phenomenon. and actually there was also \u2014 i thought it was a bit ridiculous because it went to extreme lengths, and it\u2019s gone through waves, so it\u2019s only actually gotten worse over time. i think there are now like over 10,000 coins.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: and they never die, they mostly never die. like they almost never go to zero. so it\u2019s like on the bitcoin dominance thing, the altcoins \u2014 it just keeps getting bigger, right? because there\u2019s always altcoins around. they seem like they never die off completely. so i guess over time there would be tens of thousands of them."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: right. i mean apparently there literally are if you\u2019re looking at coinmarketcap or something. the number is over 10,000, yeah. well i mean i think the dominance index is kind of a bogus economic metric for market reasons, in your background in particular, but that they are illiquid and the obvious fallacy that you\u2019ve got the unit bias where somebody will create a new coin with a quadrillion units and then you\u2019ll sell me one for a dollar and now we have the highest value coin, but the liquidity is literally zero. and so that kind of effect is baked into it because with ten thousand coins of course there are many many highly illiquid coins which barely have a price or are listed only on a decentralized marketplace, a very tiny exchange with no liquidity, or basically forgotten or something. but they still have a value, yeah.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: i mean that would really be the better way is to use volume, but that\u2019s just harder data to find and aggregate. so i think people just default to the easy one which is the market cap one, because you can find price and that kind of data easier."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah but the other thing as you mentioned is that it\u2019s a moving target, so there are always new ones. so I suppose even apart from the illiquidity issue, it would be fairer to take a snapshot of some number of coins let\u2019s say three years ago and then look how that holds up against bitcoin, and roll that forwards with still-existent top-20 altcoins now and keep that going, because otherwise it\u2019s a moving target, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah exactly. so juan and i were \u2014 juan is our producer to this show \u2014 so before adam came on we were chatting about, Bitcoin has had so many challenges over the years and i feel like \u2014 maybe you have a different view \u2014 but i feel it\u2019s almost miraculous that we made it this far, that in 1,000 realities, maybe bitcoin doesn\u2019t make it in 999. maybe you disagree on that? and what do you think were the big threats to bitcoin over history and then and then maybe we can talk a little bit possibly about one of the threats going forward, because it looks like there\u2019s a couple on the horizon."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah i mean i guess the regulatory risks seemed higher in the early days just because of the uncertainty. and in the 90s with internet technology it was a bit of a reality adjustment to establishment-thinking that anybody could start a video blog \u2014 such as we\u2019re doing now, right?\u2014 and they didn\u2019t need permission from a government or a broadcasting authority, and they could see the truth as they saw it. and so they lost a lot of control of media and privacy of communication. so it changed the balance of power a bit. and so you could see something like an electronic cash system running into the same kinds of things: that various parts of the establishment might feel that they should have the exclusive right to transfer money or to seigniorage \u2014 of printing money, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah i mean there\u2019s also like non-digital examples of that, where people tried to make private money out of precious metals or things like that and were shut down by the government. they just generally don\u2019t seem to appreciate competition."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah. i mean i think that that actually worked out better than i would have thought in the sense that the regulatory acknowledgement of bitcoin has been: lighter touch more, more open to innovation. and of course there are a few countries that from time to time will ban bitcoin including some that ban it dozen times and yet it keeps going. and there are also places that \u2014 it depends on the culture and how people view things \u2014 but there are certainly countries where, when they ban something, the usage increases, or they ban it through official channels and its usage grows in decentralized marketplaces, for example.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: if there\u2019s a market demand for it i mean the market typically will find a way."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: Right. i mean i think one metric for adoption that i have used from time to time is to say: one kind of bitcoin bootstrap is \u2014 it would be disruptive \u2014 but to ask if bitcoin has bootstrapped beyond the possibility to shut it down? which is to say: if there was a global ban on bitcoin, would it stop? now of course nobody\u2019s really expecting anything like that at this point, but i think it wouldn\u2019t be possible to shut it down for reasons like: there are so many people with some bitcoin, and there\u2019s an interest to use it, that you would be able to ask a friend of a friend and find somebody who you could buy or sell some bitcoin or place a transaction through and things like that. so i think it has bootstrapped as a largely unstoppable piece of technology, but it\u2019s also being regularized at the same time. so that risk of a ban has receded. i think that bootstrap [metric] is interesting, and i think it\u2019s long past that point now. and of course you\u2019ve got, along the way \u2014 faster than anybody expected \u2014 there was interest first in the technology from banks, from financial institutions, in the blockchain technology as a kind of open-back office tech, and they like to keep up with the technology curve as new innovations come in IT and networking. so that was interesting. and then more recently of course there\u2019s been growing interest in the financial asset and more ETFs, more futures and derivatives products from established financial institutions and, yeah, just more ways to access the market.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: but that\u2019s probably i think seen \u2014 from a large part of the community \u2014 as part of the risk going forward, right? is that it gets co-opted in some way by wall street."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: well, right. i mean i think it\u2019s important to my mind for there to be a certain amount of balance, so that enough of the currency is in individual hands. i think if too much of it is in etfs and funds, there\u2019s a risk that the \u2014 i think you could draw a lesson from the so-called fork drama of the 2015 era, that there\u2019s a risk that if too much of the bitcoin in circulation is in an etf or etf-like products, then the etf fund managers, they\u2019re thinking defensive thinking with corporate lawyers about what their fiduciary responsibility is in response to regulatory pressures or other legal frameworks.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: well even though in their own personal preferences \u2014 i mean arthur hayes has a pretty good note that he sends out and he mentioned something like that on his recent note about a certain asset manager that has the ability to influence the way that individual companies can connect or behave or interact with bitcoin, so i think that\u2019s interesting as well: once they get big enough, they can have a little bit of sway on the network. but do you agree that \u2014 do you think that the fork drama, the scaling wars \u2014 i guess that\u2019s 2016-2017 \u2014 was that the biggest existential threat to bitcoin to date, do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: well i think the regulatory risk \u2014 which for most of the world didn\u2019t really materialize and actually became clearer over time \u2014 was earlier, risk perception, and yeah i think the fork drama was in the middle of it. it looked like a potentially existential risk, and that\u2019s why people were pretty defensive and activist in treating and communicating about that, and i think that risk was resolved in the right direction and was instructive to everybody, whatever your views going into that. i think the way that it resolved is interesting and i would say the lesson is that the market prevailed, and that\u2019s generally a good thing. but of course it does mean that if too much of the market is in the hands of custodians, the market could prevail in the wrong way. and i think there are ways to do \u2014 so one of the interests to use a custodian is because not everybody is an IT expert, and people are rightly worried about mismanaging backups and physical security of backups and things like that, and so that\u2019s why they will sometimes leave assets on a bitcoin exchange, or put it in a etf-like product. so the US doesn\u2019t have an etf but canada does, a number of other countries worldwide do. but i do think there are opportunities unique to the smart contracting capabilities of bitcoin in particular, that you can kind of have your cake and eat it. so one example is the blockstream green wallet which has a multisig arrangement and a timelock so that basically you can start with a two-of-two and if you lose one of the keys then it kind of falls back to a different access method. so there\u2019s a there\u2019s a patent there which today is configured to protect you from losing a two-factor authentication device \u2014 second factor \u2014 but the same technology can be used with a custodian. for example, say in the green address server \u2014 the blockstream two-factor authentication server \u2014 is not custodian, but it provides some aspects of custodian-like service \u2014 i.e the security service, that there\u2019s a two-factor authentication: you can\u2019t spend the coins or you can\u2019t spend more than a certain percentage of the coins without succeeding at authenticating to this service provider. and so you could see that being used with a custodian too with an additional failover: that you have the keys \u2014 if you lose the keys, eventually after a time period there\u2019s another clause in the contract that becomes available which is that then the custodian can help you recover the coins and reestablish that. so it\u2019s important \u2014 an interesting distinction \u2014 because it means that the custodian can\u2019t do anything with the coins without your cooperation, so it sort of changes the balance a bit. and i think that\u2019s a good way to do things, and at blockstream we\u2019ve done quite a lot of different bits of technology and even marketed assets that seek to add decentralization capabilities to financial instruments. so for example we have a mining note which is an actual financial instrument that gives you the financial participation in bitcoin mining over a three-year period. and now our interest with technology like this is to incorporate decentralization tech like the new innovations in mining protocols so that a note-holder could \u2014 once we\u2019ve got more technology ready to ship \u2014 that the participant could run their own node and have some input into choosing the transaction. usually the easiest thing to do technologically is to do the centralized thing. and so most service providers just do the easy thing and therefore it\u2019s all trust us, central server. so we\u2019re more working in the protocol space and in the financial instrument space, so we will always try to innovate on the decentralization end of it. and actually this new set of pool protocols came out something that we started at blockstream in 2014 called open hash protocol. and there are new versions of that now,\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah if you\u2019re an average investor, the mining space really for a long time has been an institutional-only kind of game. so yeah it is really interesting and it\u2019s pretty cool to have a product like the blockstream mining note where investors can come in and participate. and the minimum ticket size is kind of high right now and we\u2019ve definitely received that feedback from multiple people but once that gets on exchange and we have secondary trading around it, the prices should come down. and i think it\u2019ll be a lot more approachable and digestible to more investors, and i think that\u2019ll also build up the decentralization on that product, which i think is pretty cool."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah i mean in fact with that approach to market was the lightweight and fast entry to market, so we\u2019re certainly interested to use other marker entry points. as you say, once it\u2019s exchange-listed \u2014 and actually already it\u2019s possible to otc trade: so find somebody who bought a large amount. and the initial sale is a kind of primary sale but now that the first sales tranche is closed, you can buy in peer-to-peer trade, in fact, smaller amounts down to 0.01 of a BMN, which is a much lower price point.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: so i think that the narrative on bitcoin has changed a little bit over time. i think initially it was focused more on digital cash and then over time i think particularly recently we\u2019ve seen just these massive changes in the global economy, inflation is more of a concern, that people are really looking at it as a store of value more than a medium of exchange, and kind of a digital gold. so how has that changed over time? and do you think we eventually get back to the digital cash? \u2014 kind of the original narrative at some point ?\u2014 or do you think that\u2019s still there with lightning? it seems like it\u2019s been more topical recently ever since the el salvador announcement the last couple of weeks."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah i mean i think bitcoin has a lot of interesting features and characteristics. so it appeals to different people for different reasons, and the permissionlessness and fact that you can just install a piece of software on a smartphone and start transacting globally without needing anybody\u2019s permission or an intermediary is as a key differentiator. and in a way, there\u2019s a concept of a differentiated value which is basically an area where the product is unique and nothing can really compete with it \u2014 or the incumbents can\u2019t compete with it. and i think that that is the sweet point for bitcoin because like conventional financial institutions simply can\u2019t do that. they\u2019re regulatorily precluded from offering people electronic cash, basically. i mean they can offer people bitcoin and sell it to them and they can install it in wallets, but they can\u2019t offer bank accounts on that basis. they\u2019re precluded. so it\u2019s not really possible for them to compete against that, and so that is a key part of the value proposition. but i suppose in the same way that the internet was a very interesting turning point for the balance of power and more direct user control of their electronic destiny, investors could look at the interest in that technology and buy shares in it. so in the internet area you could buy shares in cisco and paypal and all these different companies, and that if you did it at the right time, you benefited immensely from the rise of the adoption of this network technology. and so with bitcoin i mean of course there are companies too, but you can buy the electronic cash token. so i think you can view [it as]: the value of bitcoin is tied up with these use cases, and so of course people people can and will buy it even if they don\u2019t personally have a strong need for the permissionless electronic money, right? i mean if somebody\u2019s living in a western country, maybe they don\u2019t really do anything very interesting and they don\u2019t don\u2019t need it as such, but it\u2019s still a very cool technology, so lots of people will do it because they think it\u2019s cool or it\u2019s an insurance policy and of course the uncorrelation and electronic gold-like properties help, and the adoption curve has been very steep at times, so it\u2019s price has appreciated very highly. so, many people will obviously buy things if the price is going up even if they don\u2019t have a direct need themselves, they assume, correctly, that other people see a strong attraction to it. and actually it\u2019s an interesting question because some people will talk about a sort of etf failure point or a paypal 2.0 by which they mean that some of these use cases could probably be perfectly viable in isolation. so if bitcoin were to be only in etfs and literally a digital gold that could only be held in that format, that might still be financially interesting if you can audit the supply, see that that\u2019s happening and have it be an uncorrelated gold hedge without the electronic cash parts. that could still financially succeed. of course it\u2019s not nearly as interesting to many of us, and presumably its market value will be lower reflective of that. so i think it\u2019s interesting for bitcoin to reach its potential in capturing both of those use cases, but that\u2019s that\u2019s a factor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: yeah it feels like different regions maybe will have slightly different uses. i\u2018m reminded of that seeing the adoption in el salvador, because in the western world i would think for people to go and use bitcoin to buy coffee, you definitely want to see the volatility come down. like i\u2019m not going to use my bitcoin to buy coffee because i think it\u2019s going to be worth more in the future, right? kind of a reverse time-value of money thing. so maybe in western countries where people have no issues doing basic transactions, and like you said are not as concerned about privacy or whatever, then maybe the volatility needs to come down in bitcoin \u2014 it needs to flatten out a little bit \u2014 before it becomes attractive as a medium of exchange."}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: yeah i mean it\u2019s kind of like being able to make a payment directly from a stock investment. you want to hold for something that you have high hopes for. and i mean of course some people are all-in so they have no choice, or they take low interest loans as a kind of tax-planning strategy to defer selling. but i think the other thing is \u2014 you get the pizza effect as you mentioned \u2014 so people will buy things with bitcoin and then years later it will turn out to be an expensive purchase. so what i try to do to avoid that is \u2014 some things you want to buy with bitcoin, for privacy reasons or because it\u2019s easier and just like wire transfers and credit cards and debit cards are annoying, like they\u2019re clunky, they\u2019re painful, they\u2019re error-prone \u2014 so bitcoin is just easier too, right? and so what i\u2019ve done at times is use bitcoin to pay for something then go buy some more bitcoin quickly before the price moves too much so that i\u2019m not going to be like really annoyed that i spent 10 times the current price on a router or something that you\u2019re trying to buy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: So looking forward \u2014 i mean i wrote out these questions before the news of the last couple of weeks. i mean we\u2019ve had some really interesting and exciting news come out over the last couple of weeks. but what do you think is the most exciting thing to look forward to in the bitcoin space at the moment?"}
{"prompt": "Adam Back: i mean for the market i think usually it seems like bitcoin has surprised to the upside in terms of stages of deployment. like people have said that $10,000 dollars is kind of a crazy price and now that\u2019s in the past, right? and so from the price front and in terms of types of users \u2014 recalling that earlier, nobody would have imagined that banks would want to be involved with bitcoin \u2014 and now we have banks offering bitcoin denominated bank accounts and queuing up to get active in the space with bitcoin as an asset-class or bitcoin-secured loans, and we\u2019re seeing some early signs of government \u2014 i guess the el salvador news, like the sovereign involvement. there may actually be \u2014 indirectly \u2014 some sovereign mining or sovereign bitcoin holdings or bitcoin reserves. so those kind of things earlier on people thought, Oh, that\u2019s a pipe dream \u2014 that\u2019ll never happen! but it seems like these things just keep happening and happening in a faster pace than people imagine. so it\u2019s like the Chinese saying about, blessed to live in interesting times. so it really does feel a lot like that because all these wild things just keep happening as new benchmarks of adoption or a first exemplar of a new type of institution. the phenomena of companies putting bitcoin on the balance sheet i thought it\u2019s very interesting \u2014 that wasn\u2019t something people foresaw i think, but it makes a lot of sense. of course the current macro environment \u2014 precipitated by COVID \u2014 but the makings of it were obviously there since probably 2008, has focused a lot of people\u2019s minds on inflation, because clearly the real inflation rate is much higher than the consumer price index-claimed rates and so on.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Jesse Knutson: i was going to say, that\u2019s another crazy one too because i mean just two or three years ago i would talk to analysts and i would talk about inflation and they would say, The cpi is low. i said, no no i don\u2019t mean cpi, i mean inflation \u2014 like my kid\u2019s tuition going up every year, right? my house price going up \u2014 these kind of things, and people would look at you and just not admit that there was any inflation anywhere. and i think it was creeping higher \u2014 it has been for arguably a generation \u2014 and you\u2019re very right that COVID just lit a fire on all this tinder that\u2019s been stacked up, and accelerated a lot of trends. and bitcoin is probably one of those big trends i think. well that that\u2019s great, adam. thanks a lot for your time today. i really appreciate you taking the time and joining us on our first podcast."}

We\u2019re gonna talk just a little bit about Bitcoin today. I\u2019ve got a ton of questions\u2014it\u2019s like non-stop, especially over the last 3\u20134 months \u2014 so I\u2019ve been looking forward to the conversation. So a little background and we\u2019ll go from there."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski: Sweet. Most people these days would know me in and around the Bitcoin space, but prior to Bitcoin\u2014and for most of my life \u2014 I was more entrepreneurial in terms of background. So ever since I went to uni \u2014 I was really academically strong back at school, and my core subjects of strength were physics, math, chemistry, and all of that. So I ended up doing engineering, but I dropped out of uni because I wanted to make my millions by the time that I was 20 and I put my scholarship money on the stock market \u2014 thought I was a genius in 2007 \u2014 and I got absolutely raped. And yeah I was right in the thick of the whole GFC [Global Financial Crisis] stuff and that put my life in a completely different track. I dropped out of uni, I had to start some businesses to dig myself out of the hole. And my hole I was in was quite deep \u2014 I was about $250,000 in debt by the time I started in my 20\u2019s. And since then my life has been this entrepreneurial journey of starting different businesses, blowing some up, learning what not to do alongside what to do. I was an early gold/silver bug in the 2011\u20132012 period between what I saw during the GFC and learning about the first rounds of major QE [Quantitative Easing] at the time. It put me down that rabbit hole. Unfortunately, when Bitcoin came across my radar I dismissed it as, \u201cWhatever, Internet funny money \u2014 I\u2019ll stick with my gold and silver \u2014 my hard money,\u201d to my everlasting dismay, shame, and regret. But hey, after that I built a couple different businesses\u2014some successful, some fucking complete disasters. And it was in 2016 where I got Steve Jobs\u2019ed out of my tech company that I built \u2014 the board pushed me out. And it was a mixture of arrogance on my part and stupidity on their part and everything, so they ended up taking over the company and sending it down the toilet because they spent all the money too quickly. But I was probably also a little bit of an immature tech entrepreneur at that stage, so we had our differences. But at the time that was a really painful experience for me, but what was interesting was that it was a catalyst for me to rediscover Bitcoin. And from there, as I looked at Bitcoin I was like, \u201cHoly shit, this thing is still around? What the hell is going on here?\u201d I started digging, and the more I dug, the more I found something that aligned with me, not only philosophically, but morally, idealistically \u2014 it aligned with so many of my core values around non-intervention, around voluntaryism, around individual responsibility, individual sovereignty, around the idea of getting the government and all of this shit out of the fucking way. So all of this stuff really, over time, aligned with me, and I very quickly became a Bitcoin maximalist, not through peer-pressure \u2014 like, I found my way there, then I found Bitcoin Twitter. And there was a couple articles which sort of put me on the map. I think the two were: (1) I wrote this one called Homo Sapiens, Evolution, Money & Bitcoin, and I made the argument that Bitcoin is an invention started 70,000 years ago. And I took people through an anthropological journey of how human society evolved, and how money was the tool that actually enabled human society to increase in complexity. There was that one (2) and also I wrote Bitcoin (BTC) / Bitcoin Cash (BCH). It was like the definitive guide. For those that know Murad Mahmudov\u2019s work \u2014 the Lindy Effect chart and Bitcoin\u2019s evolution as a store of value, medium of exchange, and all of that \u2014 so he based that off that article where I created this pyramid of importance with respect to how Bitcoin will evolve in line with how natural systems evolve. That was where I first landed on the map, and alongside that time I had the early ideas for Amber, and here we are a couple years later.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [5:58]: Walk us through real quick what Amber is, when you got started, and where it\u2019s at today?"}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [6:02]: Amber is a really simple idea, which is: a Bitcoin accumulation product. We were the first DCA product in the world. There\u2019s a series of others these days, whether it\u2019s Swan or River and there\u2019s a couple others in Europe. So we were the first ones to build a product that enabled users to effectively accumulate Bitcoin. That was the whole point, is: I wanted to help people buy Bitcoin in a simple and easy fashion. And having learnt through errors over the years \u2014 when I think about all the time and energy I wasted trading derivatives and every single financial product you can think of, if all I did was just put ten bucks a week aside into Amazon, I\u2019d be a millionaire. But no \u2014 I thought I was a genius, I thought I would outsmart the market, I thought all this fucking bullshit. And maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, of all the trading I\u2019ve done over the last 10, 12, 13 years, I might be \u2014 if I\u2019m lucky \u2014 even. Whereas, all I had to do was put ten bucks a week aside. So I wanted to build a product that did that particularly for Bitcoin because I think that the most important thing any individual can do for their future selves and for their kin is to collect Bitcoin. And that\u2019s effectively what the app does. We started it \u2014 like I raised capital in 2018, we went right through the bear market and all that sort of shit. It was really difficult. And with all these experiences that I had in the past \u2014 one of these guys in the chat mentioned Shark Tank in Australia \u2014 and yeah, I was on Shark Tank in a prior business. And it was an interesting experience for me, because at that time I was this young entrepreneur, I learnt the difference between raising capital versus the entertainment value in a show. Like all the stuff that I had said prior to going into the Shark Tank and out of the Shark Tank was actually prerecorded: so they actually coached me on what to day so I looked like an even bigger fucking fool, and \u2014 obviously, as the media does very well \u2014 I was in there for an hour and twenty minutes and I think they only cut down to 15 minutes and they showed like the most embarrassing parts. So I learnt through the school of hard knocks with all of that stuff. But throughout my life I\u2019ve picked up experience from all of these areas and I think that really helped me carry Amber through the bear market, in particular, because I was raising capital for equity in a real business whilst idiots were raising millions of dollars for fraudulent token sales for fucking toasters on a blockchain, or whatever other ridiculous dumbass ICO there was. And it was hard for us to raise capital\u2014and we raised a fraction of what these ICOs raised by selling our company, whereas these guys didn\u2019t sell anything except the fucking promise of a pipe dream on a white paper. And they raised millions \u2014 they are all bankrupt today. We are still here with a product, delivering on what we originally promised. And I think we kind of credit that to all of the trials and tribulations that I\u2019ve been through in the prior chapters of my life. So to answer your original question, where we are now is: we\u2019re fully functional in Australia\u2014we are the easiest way to buy Bitcoin in Australia. Next step for us is to enter the US market, then we\u2019ll look at entering the UK, Europe, and sort of expand our presence out into the world. And the mission is still the same from day dot, which is: to enable the mechanism for people to accumulate Bitcoin in the easiest way possible. And that\u2019s it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [9:56]: Yeah it\u2019s interesting: I talk to a lot of people about Bitcoin and I feel like it\u2019s a progression. I think some people may adopt it a little bit quicker than others like personally, but I feel like \u2014 just going through my journey \u2014 it\u2019s a couple steps. And I\u2019d love to get your thoughts on this. But maybe the first would be speculation, where I see a lot of people looking at Bitcoin as this vehicle to get more fiat. Like, \u201cHey I\u2019m gonna buy Bitcoin [as a speculative] asset, then I\u2019m gonna wait until it doubles and then just take my fiat out and now I have two times as much fiat.\u201d So I feel like that\u2019s (1) speculation. (2) maybe is like the hedge, or part of a portfolio allocation. And then the third step is (3) your unit of account. And when I tell people that\u2019s how I see Bitcoin, I get a lot of weird looks, like, \u201cWhat are you even talking about? Unit of account?\u201d Like, when you go through these progressions and you get to the third step, you really stop seeing dollars, you stop seeing fiat, and all you see is sats. And I know some people are like, \u201cWhoa! I\u2019m not level three \u2014 I\u2019m just learning,\u201d and all that. But what do you think about that progression? Because \u2014 I don\u2019t know about you \u2014 but that\u2019s how I\u2019ve looked at it."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [11:21]: I think that\u2019s true. There\u2019s two things I\u2019ll mention here: (1) I said to one of the Telegram groups, \u201cMy net worth went up today because I measure my net worth in Bitcoin.\u201d So I actually bought more Bitcoin today. And people are like, \u201cMy net worth went down today.\u201d No no no \u2014 because I\u2019ve actually got more Bitcoin today than I did yesterday, and that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m measuring. And for me, my net worth has just been consistently going up, because I\u2019m consistently collecting Bitcoin. So I think when you finally get to stage three, the price of Bitcoin doesn\u2019t even mean shit anymore except that whenever you come across some fiat you\u2019re able to convert that fiat into more Bitcoin if the price is lower, which is always a good thing. I actually enjoy it when the price of Bitcoin is lower because I can exchange more of the shit fiat that I have with someone on the other side who\u2019s willing to give me their Bitcoin for this worthless fake government money. So I\u2019m always thankful for that. But to your point about the progression \u2014 I think that is quite true. So I\u2019ve got a saying that most people know from my Tweets and podcasts and stuff, which is: \u201cI came for the money, and I stayed for the money.\u201d And what that means is basically what you described. It\u2019s: I came to speculate and make some money, but as I discovered what this is, I realized that, \u201cNo \u2014 holy shit. The most important thing happening in the world today is the de-monopolization of money, is the ripping out of the hands of any institution, any government, any central bank, any individual, any organization whatsoever, ripping the capacity for any of them or any of us\u2014anyone, anywhere \u2014 to print money.\u201d That is the most important thing happening. So it\u2019s the separation of money and state. And for me that\u2019s what\u2019s kept me here, and what\u2019s allowed me to dig deeper into Bitcoin. And out of all the topics that I\u2019m involved in, for those who know my podcasts and stuff \u2014 I go into some really crazy topics whether it\u2019s religion and philosophy \u2014 I just did one with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py who wrote The Revolutionary Phenotype, which is probably the most important work on biology since Dawkin\u2019s Selfish Gene, maybe even since Darwin\u2019s Natural Selection. So it\u2019s like I go into all sorts of stuff, but for me the one all-encompassing topic is Bitcoin. It just keeps sucking me in, because it touches on all of these areas that I\u2019m interested in and that aligns so strongly with the core values that I have as a human being and as a \u201csovereign individual.\u201d So yeah I think that conversion is important, and I think the journey from coming in and looking at it as a speculative way to make money and then staying in it as, \u201cThis is the money that I\u2019ve now adopted and that I\u2019m measuring my productive capacity in,\u201d really depends on what seeds have been planted along the way. So I was lucky enough to have lost everything in the global markets in 2007\u20132008. I started developing a really healthy distaste for government, for intervention, for QE, and all that sort of stuff at an early age \u2014 in my really early 20\u2019s. I started off as an entrepreneur so I became extremely responsible, like I\u2019d never had a paycheck literally until recently\u2014over the last year and a half or two years where Amber started making money I\u2019d actually started drawing a salary \u2014 I\u2019d never had a salary in my entire life, ever. Ever, ever, ever, ever. I never knew what a salary felt like, because if I made money \u2014 you know, in some businesses I made money, in some businesses I fucking lost everything \u2014 so there\u2019s been periods where I was eating cans of tuna and fucking one can of tuna a day for a whole week, there\u2019s been periods where I\u2019ve been doing very well. So I\u2019ve always had this sort of tumultuous existence because I\u2019ve always chosen a path of responsibility. And for me that was a real primer as well about Bitcoin, because I call Bitcoin the Renaissance of Responsibility. We live in a world of complete dependency\u2014dependency on the state, dependency on supply chains, dependency on all sorts of shit \u2014 and that creates a very fragile world, and a very fragile existence. Where if something cracks or if something pops, everything else starts to break down. Whereas living a life of responsibility actually gives you true freedom, true choice, true capacity to be sovereign, true capacity to make decisions. And yeah, those early seeds for me I think helped me really adopt and embody the idea of Bitcoin quicker than maybe most. But even irrespective of that, I still had to go through the journey. So thinking of it as a journey is spot-on.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [16:49]: Yeah and also too I think it\u2019s a blessing if you had money in the market in \u201808 \u2014 I really believe that. Pretty similar to what you were mentioning, my story is: my step-dad made me open up a ROTH IRA retirement account when I was 18 and then just a few years later, half of it\u2019s gone, down 50% because of the GFC, right? But that\u2019s when you learn your lessons. Because it forced me to ask, \u201cWhy is this happening? What is going on?\u201d as you were mentioning. I was trying to find some meaning. The unfortunate side of it is I heard about Bitcoin in like 2012\u20132013, but I feel like the very first time you hear about it \u2014 and a lot of people say this \u2014 people ignore it, typically. Like the very first time. Unless maybe [you were] a cryptographer or you really understood the technology inside and out initially. So for me my cousin told me about it in 2012\u20132013 and I\u2019m like, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d Then 2016, being around the financial markets I\u2019ve always been fascinated with charting and things like that, and you see an asset that\u2019s hit the high of like $1,200 and then it consolidated for three years and all of a sudden it\u2019s re-testing those $1,200 highs from 2013 in 2017. You know, the ETF talk and all that, so it was very interesting just from a charting perspective, like, \u201cWow! This asset consolidated for three years and now it\u2019s re-testing those highs.\u201d That was just interesting. So that\u2019s when I started following it more price action-wise \u2014 but then still ignoring it! And then I didn\u2019t even have any amount in it that was significant until China banned exchanges, and then it crashed from like $4,800 to $3,500 that night. I\u2019ll never forget that night. I\u2019m like, \u201cWell it\u2019s down 30%, I guess there\u2019s no\u201d\u2014 those corrections! It was like the fourth correction during that cycle. But even then in 2017 as I mentioned earlier it was more speculation. It wasn\u2019t until 2018\u20132019, like when you really dig deep, that\u2019s what really pulled me down the progression even more to see it as not just a hedge, but a portfolio allocation. And then I feel like the kicker \u2014 I read the Bitcoin Standard \u2014 and then there\u2019s just so much great content that\u2019s been put out over the last 2\u20133 years especially. But obviously 2020 happened and then we had the capitulation. And I think 2020 in March \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear your take too \u2014 but the lowest buy I got in March of 2020 was at $4,500. I\u2019ll never forget that night. I\u2019ll never forget it. Because it was like one of those moments like\u2014you\u2019re on the edge: if you didn\u2019t quite believe in Bitcoin you probably got out because you panicked. Or you were fine because you knew what asset you had. So I didn\u2019t bottom-tick at all \u2014 I didn\u2019t get to $3,900 \u2014 I wish. But it was that conviction, and anything that you\u2019re putting value into, your conviction\u2019s gonna get tested."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [19:37]: Yeah. So two things in there: I think you mentioned, \u201cIf you\u2019re a cryptographer or an engineer you understand the technology and are likely to get it.\u201d I actually would push back on that. I think that those people are the least likely to get it and that those people are most likely to become shitcoiners and create their own chain and end up doing that. I think to really appreciate Bitcoin \u2014 and me and Giacomo Zucco talked about this on Episode 25 of the Wake Up Podcast \u2014 but we discussed it on there and he put together a model, like a Venn Diagram, which is: you need to understand technology well enough, you need to understand ethics, morality, Libertarianism and that stuff well enough, and then you need to understand economics and monetary history well enough. And somewhere where those three disciplines overlap, there\u2019s a Venn Diagram and it\u2019s in the middle where you\u2019re a Bitcoiner. And when any two of those overlap you\u2019re either a goldbug, a shitcoiner, something else \u2014 whatever. But I think that the Bitcoiner in the Venn Diagram is really rare and it requires quite a broad, general understanding of a series of topics, and that\u2019s why I think that the greatest thinkers in this space \u2014 the people like your Breedloves and your Saifedeans and your Michael Goldsteins and your Pierre Rochards and all of that \u2014it\u2019s because they\u2019re broadly capable enough to cross a bunch of different disciplines, and they found the essence of all of those. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin seems to reward \u2014 not the techies, not just the pure monetary guys \u2014 because there\u2019s so many Austrian economists and Libertarians. Like for the life of me, I don\u2019t understand how the fuck they don\u2019t get Bitcoin. Like I call them the battered women of politics. Because \u2014 Libertarians, especially \u2014 it always cracks me up: they\u2019re always talking about how dumb the state is, like the state needs to get out of the way, and all this sort of stuff, but they don\u2019t do anything about it! Like here\u2019s Bitcoin as a tool to enable the dream that Libertarians have always had \u2014 but they don\u2019t fucking adopt it! Like, it\u2019s insane! So that\u2019s one thing I just wanted to put forward there. Your other question about the conviction in March \u2014 so I actually remember March quite distinctly. I was in Berlin, I had been kicked out of my Airbnb because some cranky fucking old bag of a neighbor got annoyed because apparently my speaker was too loud and the Airbnb host kicked me out of the apartment the night before, so I had to check out that day. And as I\u2019m checking out \u2014 I\u2019m sort of in this foreign country, I was supposed to fly out but my flight got cancelled because all the Corona bullshit happened \u2014 it was just this tumultuous thing. And that morning, like Bitcoin\u2019s fucking crashing and I\u2019m sitting there outside in the foyer of this old-ass building trying to get WiFi at the door because the cleaner\u2019s in there, he\u2019s like, \u201cLook, you can\u2019t stay in here, you gotta get out.\u201d And I\u2019m sitting there trying to like buy fucking Bitcoin. And at the same time\u2014like, one of the things I do is I never sell my Bitcoin, so I always just draw a little bit of US Dollars against it through Unchained Capital. So at that time, my fucking loan went into margin so I almost got liquidated \u2014 I almost lost a bunch of my Bitcoin through Unchained. So I\u2019m sitting there like trying to buy more Bitcoin and at the same time move Bitcoin from my Ledger and my Trezor to get it over to Unchained to like consolidate the loan and all this sort of shit, but I don\u2019t have Internet access and the staff\u2019s telling me to get out of the fucking apartment. And like it was just this chaos, absolute chaos of a day\u2014and dude, I got within sixty seconds of losing half of my Bitcoin and being liquidated that day, because I had to go drive to the shopping center somewhere to get Internet access to move every last bit of Bitcoin I had from my Ledgers, from my Trezors, from my different exchanges that I had just bought, getting money shuffled and all this sort of stuff. And I just fucking made it. And luckily on that day, I ended up with more Bitcoin than I had, but I came that close to basically losing most of my stack. Just because like\u2014 it was just an awkward day! If it had happened one day earlier, I would have been at home with WiFi and I would\u2019ve been able to deal with all of that stuff. But it was just a classic \u2014 one of the Aleks Svetski stories of shit hitting the fan. But yeah I mean \u2014 that, for me \u2014 I was like a pig in shit in the sense that I couldn\u2019t believe people were just dumping this thing! I was like, \u201cWhat the fuck is wrong with everyone?\u201d I wish I had more cash, basically. I just wish I had more cash that day.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [24:38]: Yeah I\u2019ll be honest too, I wish I was more liquid at the time. Like you just said, the way that things just lined up I was just not as liquid as I wanted to be. Like I got some $4,500 but obviously I wanted more and more. But I think a lot of people were just in a crunch. Just the way it ended up working out \u2014 and everyone personally is in a different situation. But yeah, for those that may not know, Bitcoin within two days went from $9,000 to $3,900 back in mid-March. I know in like Clubhouse rooms, people ask me, \u201cWell, [look at] what happened to Bitcoin in March.\u201d But really every asset in the world got crushed because it was a flock from assets into the Dollar. The Dollar was the only thing that spiked. And it was people getting margin called and everything else, and not having enough collateral to post and things like that. So then if you look at the DXY chart, the Dollar spiked and then really has been in a down-trend ever since March. But that\u2019s essentially what happened. It wasn\u2019t so much a fundamental thing that people were selling their QQQ or selling their SPY or selling their Bitcoin, it was literally like they had to sell for collateralization and things like that \u2014 it was just a cascade effect."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [25:57]: Well that\u2019s the fragility of global markets at the moment, is that everything is so extended. So I would argue that there was some fundamental stuff there, which is people actually freaked out about what the fuck did the virus mean, and what the hell do these lockdowns mean? So everyone shit their pants but the markets collectively overreacted because everything is stretched so finely that everyone basically got margin called across almost every single asset. And it precipitated into one of the most major flash crashes we\u2019ve ever seen. Like, that was insane!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [26:39]: Yeah. I want to go deeper into a couple other things. I do want to grab some questions [from the chat], guys. So Lance, thank you so much for jumping in with a question. So Aleks, \u201cDo you see institutional investors in Australia coming into your platform as a hedge or portfolio allocation?\u201d You\u2019re already shaking your head, no."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [26:55]: No we\u2019re a retail product, man. We\u2019re not gonna service \u2014 those guys have multiple other options. Like we\u2019re here to help the little guy set up whether it\u2019s with PayID or with direct debit or EFT or credit card or Apple Pay or debit card or whatever \u2014 we just want to make acquiring and accumulating Bitcoin simple for everyday people. But absolutely no interest in servicing the institutions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [27:22]: Yeah and to that point, I\u2019ve also referenced Bitcoin as a savings technology, and I\u2019m sure I saw that from Pierre Rochard or someone else writing. But if you look at it more like people look at a mindset of a 401k, kind of a set it and forget it \u2014like I had a conversation, somebody took me out to lunch earlier today and they were asking, \u201cHow do you see Bitcoin?\u201d And initially I\u2019m like, \u201cHey look, just see it as just a savings technology.\u201d Like I put a lot of my value \u2014 and I don\u2019t mind saying it\u201475% of my net worth is. The other 25% is a lot of like my personal home that I haven\u2019t been able to get equity out of, right? So I\u2019ve done it over the last especially two years, because it\u2019s my value, and no one can do anything to it! And that\u2019s what I was telling him today, like, \u201cNo one can inflate on it.\u201d No one can inflate my value away when I have it in cold storage. You can\u2019t do anything to me\u2014to my sats. Like, I dictate if my sats go up or down based on my decision, not nine people making a decision to inflate away my value. So ultimately that\u2019s like the crux as to why over the years I went from speculation to the unit of account. That really seeped into my brain last year."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [28:37]: Yeah, I couldn\u2019t agree more. Like, all of these things that we\u2019ve sort of created over the last 3, 4, 5, 6, decades are basically mechanisms for people desperately trying to figure out a way to preserve wealth for the future, because savings don\u2019t exist anymore. You can\u2019t save! Like, the entire system is deranged, and it rewards two things: consumption and blind chase for yield in a desperate bid to preserve and somehow generate wealth quicker than what you\u2019re losing it as in cash. So it\u2019s like, it is so fundamentally wasteful, it is stupid, it is a gross misallocation of assets. And it really dawned on me a couple of years ago sitting at a cafe with my mum: she\u2019s been working all her life and particularly over the last 5-6 years she saved up something like $50,000 or whatever it was, and she\u2019s sitting there saying, \u201cWhat do I do with my money? I don\u2019t know anything about the markets, your brother,\u201d\u2014like my brother\u2019s a trader and fucking \u2014 I call him a gambler. He\u2019s an idiot. You know, he\u2019s saying oh, I should give him the money and he should trade it. The issue is: the last time I gave him the money he lost it all. And she\u2019s like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave it in the bank because I\u2019m not earning anything.\u201d And I\u2019m sitting there thinking like, \u201cFucking hell.\u201d Imagine working your ass off for years \u2014 like your entire life \u2014 and not knowing what the fuck to do with your money because it\u2019s just gonna like melt. It is criminal \u2014 and that\u2019s what pisses me off \u2014 it\u2019s like: Bitcoin does away with all of the crap that we\u2019ve sort of built around superannuation or 401ks or these fucking ETFs and blind chasing yield and all this crap. It does away with all of that. All of it, all of it, all of it, all of it \u2014 because it\u2019s unnecessary. It\u2019s not needed for society to function. What\u2019s needed for society to function, and what\u2019s the very foundation of civilization, is the capacity for an individual to perform work and to save. And then, in the future, use those savings for something that they want to acquire or to invest in. Simple as that. And we don\u2019t have the savings function in society today, and as a result, we are blind fucking consumers, we are investing in shit that doesn\u2019t matter, we\u2019re creating bubbles across every single asset class, and we\u2019re wondering why the the world is so fucked up at the moment. So I think Bitcoin does away with all that stupidity and I just find that extraordinarily powerful and extraordinarily interesting.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [31:21]: Yeah I think about Thiers\u2019 law a lot, about kind of what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s this slowly, then suddenly \u2014 obviously is the name of the Bitcoin space. So for someone that may not know, Thiers\u2019 law is this good money driving out bad money concept, and I think about that a lot. It\u2019s happening slowly, obviously\u2014well it depends who you ask what slowly is, I guess \u2014 but suddenly, people are going to want a better money. As everything like you said\u2014that sums it up, and I just feel it\u2019s just who gets the information first. I know it sounds silly, maybe. It\u2019s just how I look at it\u2014it\u2019s the information asymmetry as to what Bitcoin is. And you look at history: whoever adopts the most sound money first, wins."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [32:10]: Well money represents the productive capacity of a society. Simple as that. So like we perform work, we trade our two scarce resources \u2014 our time and our energy \u2014 for something that we can measure it in. So we need to measure the productive capacity of each human being. And we do that with this technology called money. And money is a meta-idea that has existed since the beginning of time, like I\u2019ve discussed it in the article that I wrote a couple years ago. So of course the more the tool or the object or the technology we use maps to the meta-idea of money, the more functional society is, and the more society can actually build real wealth. And this is something\u2014like I always use the example of the Spaniards in the 1300s, the 1400s, the 1500s. So these guys \u2014 even on a gold standard \u2014 they conflated the idea of money with the idea of gold. And what they did is they actually hyperinflated themselves on a gold standard. They went and they dug up all the fucking gold from South America and whatever else they did, they brought it all back to Spain, they increased their supply of gold, and they crashed their own fucking economy because they conflated gold with money. It doesn\u2019t matter how much [you have] of the object you create as money \u2014 if you\u2019re not increasing the productive capacity of society, you don\u2019t have more wealth! Wealth is something that we create through work. And therein lies one of the things that modern economists, modern economics \u2014 all this sort of shit \u2014 just doesn\u2019t seem to understand. And it really is a 101 concept, is: you create wealth not by fucking printing it, but by doing some sort of work and adding some sort of valuable input into society. And Bitcoin is the apex money, the apex technology, that can map as closely as possible to money, because it is fixed, because it\u2019s open in nature, because it is voluntary in nature. And like you said, good money pushes out bad \u2014 and for those who want to know it\u2019s called Gresham\u2019s Law \u2014 and I kind of call it more than just Gresham\u2019s Law, I call it economic Darwinism. And I always use the example when I\u2019m on Clubhouse to chat, which is: if you\u2019re gonna work for a week at a cafe or whatever you\u2019re gonna do \u2014 you\u2019re gonna work at your job for a week \u2014 and at the end of the week, the employer turns around and says, \u201cYep. I\u2019m gonna pay you in salt.\u201d Or in toilet paper, or in glasses or something. And you\u2019re like, \u201cFuck off! Give me the money! I want the money!\u201d And the reason you want the money is: you demand the most salable good \u2014 the one that is the most capable of storing value in a stable manner, the one that is able to be exchanged easily, the one that you can measure other goods and services in and [tie to] the unit of account function. Nothing can compete with Bitcoin\u2019s capacity to perform those three functions of money, because nothing scores a 10/10 across all of the attributes of money: divisibility, portability, recognizability, fungibility, scarcity, impossibility to forge. Nothing competes with Bitcoin on those attributes, and therefore in its ability to perform the functions of money. So what is going to happen over time \u2014 and it\u2019s not a matter of if, it\u2019s a complete matter of when \u2014 is who is going to decide to demand Bitcoin for their time, their energy, their services, and the products first. And I wrote an article about this mid-last year called Bitcoin and Lockdowns, where I put forward a model for understanding hyperbitcoinization and what the trend will look like, and it\u2019s a necessity curve. So on one side you\u2019ve got curiosity, and then on the other side you\u2019ve got pain. And somewhere on the spectrum of curiosity to pain, people adopt Bitcoin. Now if you\u2019re more curious, you\u2019re gonna get into Bitcoin because you want to. If you\u2019re more ignorant, you\u2019re gonna get into Bitcoin because you have to, because some sort of painful situation emerges that pushes you into it. Either way, you\u2019re gonna get there. So the only choice is not, \u201cAre you gonna use Bitcoin,\u201d \u2014 because you will \u2014 whether you like it or not, you\u2019re gonna have to. The only choice is: when and on what terms are you gonna use Bitcoin? So yes, information asymmetry has something to do with it, but also so does where you are, the life you\u2019ve grown up in, how much personal responsibility you take, what your personal ideologies are, how your value hierarchy is \u2014 and all that stuff really matters, because if it maps closely to Bitcoin then hey\u2014you\u2019re gonna adopt Bitcoin before the other clown who believes in money printing and socialism or wealth distribution, all that sort of stuff. They\u2019re never gonna get fucking Bitcoin so they\u2019ll probably be the last to come onboard. So I know there\u2019s a lot there, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any threads you want to pull on, but yeah it\u2019s gonna happen whether like it or not.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [37:42]: Yeah and it\u2019s something that I get a lot as I\u2019m trying to orange pill people\u2014my buddies, especially\u2014I\u2019ve been going hard for the last three years at poker games and stuff like that or whatever, and they\u2019ve always given me the weird looks in \u201918, \u201919, and it\u2019s just funny how they don\u2019t come calling or come asking until it\u2019s over $20k. I just laugh \u2014 humans are very interesting about when people get interested in things. So I know that\u2019s a whole rabbit hole for you and I totally get that. But it\u2019s funny how it is. So one of the things that comes up is, \u201cWell Cris, how is it a store of value when it\u2019s so volatile?\u201d And I go down talking about price discovery and things like that, but no \u2014 I\u2019m actually trying to learn better how to explain to someone when they ask me that. So what\u2019s your explanation?"}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [38:35]: I use the pizza analogy. If you take a pizza and you start chopping it into parts, you\u2019re not creating more pizza. So if you have a slice of pizza and that is your proportion of the entire pizza \u2014 and there\u2019s no way to create another pizza \u2014 your proportion of the pizza always stays the same. And that is the definition of the store of value: it\u2019s the inability to change the proportion that any person owns of the whole. That is actually the definition of store of value. Price has nothing to do with store of value. It never has, it never will. So store of value is about proportionality to the whole. And this is where I think people miss out on understanding why Bitcoin is a store of value! So when you have 1 Bitcoin, you always have 1/21,000,000th of the entire supply. That is fixed, unchangeable, incorruptible \u2014 whereas if you have the Dollar, you have no fucking clue how much of the total you have. So therein lies the store of value position for Bitcoin, is: it is a perfect store of value, because you know your proportion in relation to the whole. The price of Bitcoin has got nothing to do with Bitcoin\u2019s store of value. It\u2019s only got something to do with people\u2019s relative perception of how they individually and subjectively value Bitcoin. And that has nothing to do with store of value. That\u2019s just like my perception on water versus maybe your perception on beer. They\u2019re two different things: you might like to drink beer, I might like to drink water. That\u2019s perfectly normal. So that\u2019s how I would describe it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [40:35]: Yeah it\u2019s interesting just trying to sit down and talk with someone that\u2019s fairly new, kind of walking through. Obviously it\u2019s a process. Like people obviously want things \u2014 just like society \u2014 as a consumer mindset, they want it [snapping fingers] like that, they want the answer. Everyone has their own process into how they understand what Bitcoin is. Back to the volatility thing\u2014I think if people would change their framework and instead of looking at Bitcoin like BTC/USD where they\u2019re seeing these hyperbolic moves over time to the upside over the last eleven years, if you look at it upside-down the Dollar is crashing. If you completely inverse it, because visuals are powerful, and if you flip it around and then you say, \u201cWow, the Dollar is crashing against this asset.\u201d And everything is crashing against Bitcoin. So if people that are doing charts just flip the script on what you\u2019re looking at \u2014 and it\u2019s interesting how minds can play tricks on you in how like even minds see risk when something\u2019s going up. Like one of the hardest things to do is add to your winners because it\u2019s a psychological FOMO to get out to lock in something. For example, angel investors tend to typically have clauses to add on to companies as their valuation gets bigger. Like they\u2019re adding to their winners \u2014 VCs and whatnot downstream. So I think changing perspective \u2014 usdsat.com, you can see it priced in sats. And [the Dollar] is just absolutely crashing. So yeah the volatility is obviously a question that comes up a lot of times and like you said it\u2019s perspective."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [42:42]: I would also add like the volatility question is just one of \u2014 I\u2019m asking people like, \u201cOkay, so how would you propose a new money goes from nobody to everybody holding it?\u201d And if they go down the path of saying, \u201cWell maybe we should just set the value.\u201d Well then we\u2019re back at fiat money. An organic money has to grow, and in order to get from nothing to something that requires growth. And show me one thing on the planet in the real world, in the fucking imaginary world, wherever, that grows in a straight line \u2014 nothing, zero \u2014 it doesn\u2019t happen. Whenever I think of the volatility question when people talk about volatility \u2014 first of all, Bitcoin itself is not volatile. Bitcoin is the most stable network on the planet. The only thing that is volatile is people\u2019s subjective perception all around the world. And how many people are having deep conversations like this where they\u2019re trying to understand money, where they\u2019re trying to understand how society evolves \u2014 there\u2019s fucking barely anyone. So realistically, how many people really get Bitcoin? It\u2019s only a few. So that means most people are just out there fucking gambling. So as a result, of course there is gonna be fluctuations and subjective valuations, because all the market represents is a conglomeration of different people\u2019s perception of what this thing it valued to them subjectively. And that\u2019s all the market is showing. And all we\u2019re seeing in the rising relative price of Bitcoin is a growing proportion of individuals who understand that they will not swap their Bitcoin for any other inferior form of money. And as a result, there is less available for other people to buy or other people to gamble with, and it\u2019s just the good old investing 101 or economics 101 supply/demand equation. And once you\u2019ve been around for a while these things just start to seem so simple. Like fuck, it\u2019s just funny watching people.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [45:09]: Yeah, that was a good point. I did want to add to that. If you\u2019re talking to a portfolio manager or if someone is looking at it through a finance lens \u2014 look I get trolled by a lot of people on LinkedIn. These fiat-pushers man, they\u2019re pretty good. There\u2019s some interesting people. But when I bring up that Bitcoin has the highest Sharpe ratio \u2014 risk-adjusted returns \u2014 over any 5-year period, they have nothing to day. Because they have all these metrics they want to throw at you. But you say, \u201cHey, risk-adjusted, any 5-year period \u2014 it has the highest risk-adjusted return, it has the highest Sharpe ratio compared to any other asset class in the world.\u201d Real-estate, gold \u2014 it\u2019s the highest. So the risk that you are taking to get the gains from that asset \u2014 it\u2019s the best ratio out there, right? But you don\u2019t hear that very much! It just fascinates me that you don\u2019t hear that. But for the risk you\u2019re taking, you have the [best] upside. When someone says like asymmetric upside or asymmetric return, that\u2019s what people are talking about."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [46:38]: Yeah. I used that a lot back in the day. These days I guess for me where I\u2019m at on my journey \u2014 when you get to stage three progress that you\u2019re talking about \u2014 what you\u2019re describing there [with] risk-adjusted returns and all that stuff is basically the stage two. It\u2019s the hedge, right? You\u2019re adding that to your portfolio. It\u2019s definitely on that path. I mean it\u2019s a good argument for getting people to get some skin in the game, and I think that\u2019s a very valid point, but once you get some skin in the game you quickly start to realize \u2014 assuming you continue digging and trying to understand Bitcoin \u2014 you quickly realize that even that doesn\u2019t matter, the allocation. You start to measure your entire portfolio in Bitcoin. So when it sort of becomes the unit of account everything else sort of starts to become obsolete. One person I called out in 2019 and just watched everyone sort of kissed his asshole was Raoul Pal. I can\u2019t stand that idiot. I honestly cannot stand him \u2014 I\u2019ve never been able to stand him, long before he started talking about Bitcoin. He\u2019s just one of those clowns who failed at Goldman Sachs, like you have to be really dumb to fail at Goldman Sachs. He then went on to run a service to tell people about the markets \u2014 and he\u2019s been wrong for fucking 10 years about how everything is gonna crash. He was wrong even in March after the crash, he\u2019s like, \u201cAh yeah, this is never gonna come back \u2014 nothing is ever gonna go up again.\u201d He was wrong again. The guy is wrong about everything. And he\u2019s a perfect example of someone who just doesn\u2019t get Bitcoin. So he kind of came at it from that angle of allocating some of your portfolio to it and all that sort of stuff, but clearly because he doesn\u2019t understand Bitcoin, because he doesn\u2019t know how to think about Bitcoin as a money \u2014 despite having access to some of the best minds in the world about it \u2014 he\u2019s gone and assumed that it\u2019s just another asset in the basket. So henceforth, maybe I should also put my money into Ethereum and oh I\u2019m warming up to Ripple, and how about fucking Dentacoin or Dogecoin or whatever other bullshit he\u2019s gonna think about. So I think that\u2019s a good entrypoint \u2014 allocating some of your holdings to Bitcoin \u2014 but if you sort of stay stuck there, you are 100% prone to end up adding pointless fucking garbage into your portfolio because you think there\u2019s some sort of gain to be made by \u201cdiversifying in crypto.\u201d And I think each one has their dangers: speculation has a danger, the second part has a danger, but there\u2019s freedom and liberation in getting to the point where you understand Bitcoin as the unit of account, at which point all the other stuff starts to become irrelevant.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [49:42]: Yeah. And then obviously with what Tesla did \u2014 $1.5 billion on the balance sheet \u2014 I think there\u2019s 38 companies now with Bitcoin on their balance sheet in some form. But that number is gonna go up. It could be 100\u2013200 this year, I have no idea. I tell people that and they\u2019re like, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d and it just cracks me up. But that\u2019s just gonna continue to happen because they have to. It\u2019s not even so much they want to, it\u2019s that they\u2019ve been forced to. And the other number I wanted to bring up too is there\u2019s $20 trillion in negative yielding bonds, and my brain can\u2019t understand that. That that\u2019s an actual number. And right now Bitcoin\u2019s market cap is like $900 billion, but there\u2019s $20 trillion in negative-yielding bonds. Where essentially \u2014 layman\u2019s explanation \u2014 I give the bank money, the bank gives me back less. It makes no sense to me! But it\u2019s because of the money printing, because it\u2019s being stuffed into bonds, and it drives the yields. So it\u2019s just wild what\u2019s going on, and some of the numbers \u2014 it\u2019s really incomprehensible."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [50:53]: Modern economics have no relationship to reality. The whole thing\u2019s a fucking fairy-tale, and everything is just literally made up.

I\u2019ve asked a few people but I\u2019ve meant to ask this more. Like what has changed the most in your life because of Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [52:02]: There\u2019s so many things, man. It\u2019s propelled me to once again become like a lifelong learner. I think I had this epiphany the other week when I was preparing for the podcast with Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gari\u00e9py the biologist. And I was like, \u201cFuck me!\u201d I was sitting there studying his book and learning about the phenotypes and how DNA emerged from RNA and all this sort of stuff and I\u2019m like, I\u2019m doing this study of my own volition whereas back when I was a teenager I would have had to trot it at school to learn this shit. So I think much like the Renaissance 500\u2013600 years ago, there was this sort of inspired class of people who were driven to learn about the world cross-contextually across so many different disciplines. So for me I think one of the things that Bitcoin has inspired me to do is really become a broad lifelong learner. My level of curiosity across different subjects has gone through the roof. I think that\u2019s probably one big thing. Another big thing is it\u2019s made me a lot more frugal and a lot more discerning when it comes to spending of any sort. It\u2019s made me realize the futility of trying in any capacity as a central institution or anything to govern human action and human behavior which is effectively economic action. So there\u2019s sort of three high-level things. And maybe a fourth thing is a realization that the current paradigm that we\u2019re living in with respect to how human beings are governed and all of that, is what I like to call an overlord-subject relationship, whereas the mechanism that drives humanity forward is actually a customer-service provider relationship, because that is additive in terms of its effect. Whereas the overlord-subject relationship is reductive, because the overload is always sort of stealing. And I think things like democracy and all these sorts of ideas, all these politics of turn the world \u2014 civilization emerged through the capacity of individuals to trade amongst each other and add wealth and make it cumulative \u2014 all these institutions of governance that have emerged have basically been these parasites that have sucked value out of the value creation chain amongst human beings. And for me it\u2019s just really unveiled the fallacy around any form of governance, any form of control by human beings where moral hazard and no skin in the game exists \u2014 which is basically all the kind of regimes we\u2019re living under today, which are all self-funded by the capacity for a government or institution to print its own money and tax the populous. Alongside all those other things \u2014 like I said: being a learner, being more discerning about my spending, and just understanding the world in a more holistic, principled way. I think that\u2019s the impact Bitcoin has had on me.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [55:29]: Yeah I think bottom line for me it\u2019s: the sooner you adopt a sound money, the sooner you\u2019re free. That\u2019s just how I\u2019ve seen it just in my personal journey the past 2\u20133 years. And then it frees you to not have to be on the rat race that everyone talks about. Everyone talks about the rat race and trying to keep up and debt and half of America can\u2019t afford a $500 emergency and things like that. But it\u2019s because they are on a fiat standard \u2014 there\u2019s other reasons \u2014 but if you are under a fiat standard, if you\u2019re under an unsound money, it\u2019s chasing after inflation. Inflation is not 4%, it\u2019s 10%, probably. It might be 15% asset inflation. So you\u2019re just chasing and chasing and it\u2019s the rat race, and people have been saying it\u2019s been a rat race for years, but some don\u2019t know the answer."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [56:28]: Yeah. The reality is probably it\u2019s a rat race on quicksand. And that\u2019s why everyone is losing!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [56:40]: Right, because they\u2019re nominating their value in an unsound inflated money. In the end, I mean that\u2019s just how I look at it. And some people might take a soundbite I just did and say, \u201c Oh well if you just invest in Bitcoin then you\u2019ll be rich tomorrow.\u201d I didn\u2019t say that. I didn\u2019t say that. When you adopt a sound money over time, you\u2019re gonna be in a better spot."}
{"prompt": "Aleks Svetski [57:07]: Yeah. When people ask me, \u201cHow does Bitcoin fix the world in terms of poverty and people that don\u2019t get a change to get ahead and everything?\u201d I\u2019m like: look, the only way for a human being to move forward is to build wealth. And the only way to build wealth is to trade something of value for money and be able to save for the future. If you can\u2019t save, you cannot build wealth, and you can never ever ever get out of the rat race. And that\u2019s what Bitcoin fixes. Is: Bitcoin allows us to once again build wealth as individuals because we can save. Saving comes before investing. You can\u2019t invest without having some mechanism for saving. And by fixing that, Bitcoin actually gives people the chance \u2014 should they want it \u2014 to get out of the rat race. Without Bitcoin, you will never get out of the rat race. I mean some few of us might be able to add so much value \u2014 and that\u2019s fine, that\u2019s great. But by and large, most people just can\u2019t. They will be forever indebted and they\u2019re forever running a rat race in quicksand that they can\u2019t get out of. So what we need to do is fix the ability and the capacity for individuals to save, because when individuals can save, they can actually have a future. Without the ability to save, you can\u2019t do shit. And that\u2019s how Bitcoin fixes poverty, that\u2019s how Bitcoin gives people in worse areas a chance to get ahead. Like, imagine being in Venezuela and doing the best work of your life \u2014 producing something really good \u2014 and at the end of the week what you earn is fucking worth 80% less. Why even try? Like, why even try? It doesn\u2019t work. Like, you have to be able to save in order to get ahead. And there\u2019s no point in even fucking trying if you can\u2019t get ahead. And by fixing that, I think Bitcoin\u2019s second, third, and subsequent-order effects fix a lot of other things in society.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cris Reed [59:14]: Well hey we\u2019re up against the clock and Aleks I appreciate you sharing your experience.

{"prompt": "You know, I never in my life had anybody asked me that question before you asked it to me the first time for our first series? And when you asked me that question, that catalyzed the whole set of thinking. And it got me thinking: money is energy. And of course we did the nine-part series and we spent a lot of time talking about energy systems and engineering as a discipline of manipulating energy and why it was critical to the human race and the human condition. And so we won\u2019t re-cover any of that, because that\u2019s well-trod territory. But coming back to the question of what is money and just focusing on it, I would say, for our round two or part two of this series, I\u2019d say: money is tokenized energy within a socio-political framework. So we know money is energy. But tokenized energy \u2014 that is: a dollar is a measure of energy, a gold coin is a measure of energy, a bale of tobacco that you\u2019re trading is a token of energy. And how much energy? Well, that\u2019s where the socio-political framework comes in. You can you can measure actual physical or engineering energy and its objective, but money ends up being to a certain degree subjective because if I show up on a deserted island and I\u2019ve got a stack of gold coins and everybody has guns, and they\u2019re shooting each other, they might not accept my gold coin. Whereas if I actually offer the bullets for their gun, they might think the bullets are actually better money than the gold coin, just like cigarettes are good money and in a POW camp, but gold coins wouldn\u2019t be. So this question of what is money gets you really going. So if money is tokenized energy within a social-political framework, then we can look over the history of mankind and we realize that we\u2019ve chosen many different ways to tokenize that energy, and we\u2019ll skip through most of them because they came and they went, but there are three that popped to mind that are interesting. One is the gold standard. The second is the fiat standard. And the third is the Bitcoin standard. And when you start asking what is money, you start asking, well, what\u2019s the best monetary system? And we\u2019ve got these three systems to talk about. I think one thing that\u2019s pretty clear is that most people can\u2019t get their heads around Bitcoin because it\u2019s an utter paradigm shift. And why is it a paradigm shift? Well, because I think Bitcoin is the first digital money. It\u2019s the first digital money. Gold wasn\u2019t digital money and fiat is not digital money, either. And so economists and politicians and investors, they all lack the right mental model to understand Bitcoin because science and engineering were so intrinsic to gold that we took it for granted, because gold is a 10-pound lump of something and if you if you get slugged in the head with it, nobody had to explain that science and physics mattered. And then science and engineering kind of became like quasi-irrelevant in the fiat world. Everybody just kind of ignored science and engineering and there were no immediate clear consequences. There were just the hyperinflations and the collapses of those fiat systems. But because they abandoned gold and there was no digital money, the only alternative to one fiat, you know, the Weimar Republic fiat currency, was the [British] Pound. And that alternative was an alternative to the next thing and the next thing. So we\u2019re comparing fiat currencies or fiat monies to each other. And so there was no real need to embrace science and engineering. And Bitcoin is this paradigm shift where we have digital money crashing into, I guess what we\u2019ll call analog money, or maybe a political money is a better way to describe it. And now we start to ask the question again, what is money? And I think tokenized energy isn\u2019t good enough to explain what is money. Another way to describe money is by coming back to the ideal model. What is the ideal model of money? Ideal money is a shared, immutable, correct ledger. You know, you\u2019ve heard the phrase, Bitcoin is a shared immutable ledger and people debate about whether it\u2019s truly immutable or not, but a crypto-asset network, fully decentralized and mature, is the closest thing we can get to an immutable shared ledger in the history of the world. I think a lot of times when people describe it as a shared immutable ledger, they leave off the correct or the mathematically correct, because it\u2019s almost implied. But I think that if you were to focus upon the three critical dimensions of ideal money, you would say: (1) it\u2019s a ledger that\u2019s shared, everybody in the political system has to have the same access to the ledger. (2) It has to be immutable, no one can doctor it. But it has to be (3) correct, mathematically complete or mathematically proper, because if it\u2019s incomplete or incorrect, then it\u2019s not ideal money. So if I take that as a model, money is a shared immutable, correct ledger, then I can imagine the perfect money would be: some godlike being comes down on earth and they create this perfect uncorruptible system and they telepathically drop that shared immutable correct ledger into the heads of every human being. And every time you incur a debt, it updates the ledger and when you incur a credit, it updates the ledger. And no one can corrupt the ledger.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [9:38]: This is getting right to the heart of property, right? Where it\u2019s essentially a list of who owns what, and that ownership is premised on what favors have you rendered to the market, then you\u2019ve earned some right to redeem favors from the market. And money is just kind of the ultimate form of property and one that can be redeemed for any other form of property."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [10:01]: Yeah, I mean a shared immutable correct ledger could be used to allocate ownership of all intellectual property. You kind of need it to keep track of your music rights or your video rights or your movie rights on your iTunes Store. What do you own? Or the right registrations and licenses? Can I enter a building? Can I exit? Can I cross a border? What are my rights? And what are my obligations? And what do I own? And what do I share, and it all comes down to just a shared database, but that database needs to be immutable and correct. And that is property, the essence of property. And I suppose, when you own a piece of property, and you buy it \u2014 a piece of land five acres somewhere, then there\u2019s a deed and you go and you file the deed with the courthouse. And that\u2019s kind of critical, right. And so much of property law revolves around making sure that there are no liens on the property before I buy it, making sure that you have the proper title to it. And that you can transfer that title. And I think that money, to your point, it\u2019s kind of like the apex property, it\u2019s the sum of all property or at least it\u2019s the most important property, I suppose, because it would be the property that I could use to trade for any other property. Any other property or any other product or service. So that is my tokenized energy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [11:49] Now, what you\u2019re describing here is this movement of money out of the sphere of politics into an engineered standard. And one definition of politics I really like is the discussion of how to apply coercion. So Bitcoin seems to be this type of money that\u2019s actually moving economics out of the sphere of politics into a more hard science. That seems to be part of this paradigm shift. We\u2019ve always thought money was in the domain of who could apply force. But now it\u2019s moving into the domain of what\u2019s scientifically proper."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [12:31]: Yeah we\u2019re moving from politically engineered money to scientifically engineered money.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [12:39]: Yeah. From social engineering to scientific engineering."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [12:42]: Yeah. Is that money because the most important person in the village said it\u2019s money? Or is that money because the best engineer offered it as money? Satoshi engineered money. Whereas, every government has created money. So if we start with that model, right: shared immutable correct [money]. And now we go back to all the monetary systems in history. Start with ancient coins, right? Coin networks, well there have been so many coin networks starting with the Lydians. Each coin network is: well I have a gold coin, I have a silver coin, I have a copper coin, oftentimes, there\u2019s three different coins, you know, one for 1,000, one for 10, one for 1, they have to be at three different scales. And the shortcoming is you create a system of coinage or custom tokens, and then you start shuffling them around in a network, you can only trade to the extent that you have those tokens. And if people lose the tokens the money is gone. But then people try to counterfeit the tokens, they try to cut the coins different ways. Eventually the coins might wear down, the coins have to be carried. And so why do all these coin systems fail? I guess on one hand, there\u2019s never enough of them. There\u2019s always a limit. On the other hand, they\u2019re discrete. So you can go from 1000 to 100 to a 10, or from 1000 to a 10 to a 1 but how do you get to a 0.1 or 0.01 when you want to get to orders of magnitude more or you want to make change in the middle. You end up with all these money changers, and the result of the money changing is a huge amount of friction or impedance. And for thousands of years, people couldn\u2019t figure out how to manufacture coins that couldn\u2019t be cut or counterfeited or that were durable and so ultimately, every single mercantile system has its own internal coin system. And when you swap from one system to the second, there\u2019s this money changer in the middle and they take you for 10%. I remember traveling from London to Rome back before the EU was formed, Robert, and I showed up with dollars, and I converted my dollars into pounds. And then I think I took a plane to the Netherlands and I converted my pounds to whatever the Dutch currency was. And I went to Belgium and I converted the Dutch currency to the Belgian currency. And then we went through France, I converted it again. And then we went to Italy and I converted again, I ended up with like 50% of what I started with after about 72 hours!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [16:01]: Which makes sense to that energy analogy, because every time you have a transformation of energy from thermal to kinetic to chemical, whatever direction it\u2019s going, you have a loss. So there\u2019s this problem we\u2019ve always had, transforming one form of energy into another and back."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [16:19]: Crossing a coin network is: every single time you cross the network, there\u2019s energy loss. And then there\u2019s loss over time as people counterfeit the coins, and you can\u2019t tell. And then there\u2019s losses as the coins get debased. And so the result is what, like 5,000 different systems of coinage over time. And every one of them struggled. Ultimately, they were the basis of the gold standard. And we have this myth that there was a gold standard, the good old days, but it seems like the gold standard never worked as far as we can find anywhere. I mean, we have the stories of the Romans debasing their coinage and the collapse of the Roman Empire. And we know the Lydians eventually lost theirs. And we know there must have been hundreds of systems of coinage in Greece, and one city would sack another city and melt down their coins and create the next set of coins. So I mean there\u2019s a problem with the whole idea of coinage. And the problem with coinage is it\u2019s based on metal \u2014 metallic money. And of course, the highest form of money is the gold. So let\u2019s say it\u2019s called the gold standard. But what\u2019s the problem with the gold standard? I mean it never worked that well, because it\u2019s got some crippling flaws, and just some nagging flaws. There\u2019s inflation. Inflation is a nagging defect, it doesn\u2019t inflate fast, it inflates slow, but it inflates at 2% or 3% a year. And because it\u2019s inflating, because you\u2019re mining more gold, and you\u2019re striking more coins or whatever it is you\u2019re moving around, it\u2019s not conservative. And by that I mean it\u2019s not mathematically conservative, or it\u2019s not conservative from a scientific point of view. You start with 100 units, and then you\u2019ve got 102 units, and then 105 units, and 108 units. So whatever percentage of the gold supply you have is leaking at 2% to 3% a year. And it could be worse if it\u2019s not a closed system. So if anybody introduces new gold into the system like when the Spaniards found the Inca gold and they brought back the gold from the New World, you get a massive inflation. I think I remember reading a history of Caesar where when he came back after the Gallic Wars, he had seized so much gold that that created a hyperinflation in Rome and the interest rates leaped. And there was just too much money. And so, either there is inflation because you seized gold or another nation flooded your market with gold, or there\u2019s inflation because the gold mining process continues. And so against our ideal model of money, that means that gold\u2019s not mathematically correct. It\u2019s not conservative, nor is it correct. It\u2019s an approximation. Under the best of circumstances, it\u2019s got a 2% error a year and so over the course of a decade, the best of circumstances is like a 20%, 25% error rate. But the worst of circumstances is: I double or triple the amount of gold when I come back from sacking the Aztecs or the Incas, or I sacked Gaul and I just brought back all this gold and so then you\u2019ve just got a massive error. So gold is mathematically erroneous because you\u2019re just shuffling metallic tokens and it\u2019s not a closed system. The second problem with gold is confiscation because it\u2019s physical. The custodial rights of gold aren\u2019t really \u2014 they\u2019re not great. I guess they\u2019re a little bit better than fiat currency. But in some ways they\u2019re not as good. If I have a lot of gold, if I have a million dollars worth of gold or $10 million worth of gold, it\u2019s heavy \u2014 really heavy. I can\u2019t get it through an airport. I don\u2019t even know like \u2014 you know I tried to \u2014 I went online on Amazon once a few years ago and I wanted a little pocket knife. And I ordered this pocket knife \u2014 you know how pretty much you can only carry a blade, which is like, I don\u2019t know, half an inch long or what\u2019s the number? It\u2019s like some infinitesimally small sized blade, like a quarter inch or a half an inch blade. So I went on Amazon and I found someone advertising this really super small, dinky little knife that you could use to cut a string with. And it was advertised as being a TSA friendly, compliant little pocket knife. And I was so proud of myself, because I must have paid like $39 for it. And then I took it to the airport to go through the metal detector. And I swear that the TSA agent stopped \u2014 you know, I put all this stuff through, they stopped the luggage and said like, Show me that. And they pulled out this little half inch blade to slice a string with, like, Sir, you can\u2019t take this with you. And of course the defense of: Amazon said it\u2019s okay didn\u2019t really fly. Right? And the point of the story is, you can\u2019t even slip a needle-like metal blade through an airport. I wonder if you could carry five gold coins and get away with it? Or ten gold coins, if you can\u2019t get my little pen knife thing through? And so the answer is: it\u2019s easy to confiscate [gold coins], custodial rights are really weak. The fundamental problem with the gold standard is, the custody is difficult and the security is hyper-expensive. And by hyper-expensive, it\u2019s \u2014 how much does it cost to secure a billion dollars worth of this stuff? Like you hire 24 armed guards and you have a vault in Fort Knox?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [23:02]: Cost of custody, it scales with the amount stored. Which is something that\u2019s very problematic."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [23:07]: Yeah, the cost \u2014 you would say if there\u2019s a small amount of it, it\u2019s impossible to secure and if there\u2019s a large amount of it, it\u2019s exponentially expensive to secure. And the security cost scales in some ways exponentially with the amount you have. And also with the number of nodes. If I have 100,000 nodes, I have 100,000 points of failure. And so it scales with the number of nodes, the value of the nodes and the velocity of the nodes, or the velocity of the money, right? If I wanted to move a billion dollars of gold every day of the week, for 365 days in a row, 1,000 miles. Figure out the security cost of that, right? The conclusion is, this money is so heavy it has no velocity. It goes into Fort Knox, it sits there for 30 years, and nobody audits it. And under that circumstance you can almost delude yourself into saying it\u2019s secure. But it\u2019s only secure because there\u2019s no money velocity and there\u2019s no distribution. If I wanted to give gold to 8 billion people and wanted to move it every day, then the cost of the security would go up to consume all of the energy that humanity produces, right? Probably the cost of security for 8 billion people moving gold every day is more than the sum of the entire gross national product of the world. So the security cost doesn\u2019t work \u2014 doesn\u2019t scale.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [24:47]: This gets into then the decomposition of money into an asset and a currency. So gold is functioning as an asset but it\u2019s not useful as a currency, something that circulates. Therefore, we introduce a currency. And the other thing on gold, I guess it\u2019s the best approximation of that immutable ledger that you described as ideal money. But it has still has this error rate for both inflation, which is relatively small, but the bigger error rate has to do with the violence and confiscation risk, that it\u2019s unpredictable when the market is going to be flooded, or if you\u2019re going to be confiscated, or if your custodian is trustworthy, etc."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [25:28]: It\u2019s not correct. It\u2019s tokenized energy. And it was the best idea for tokenizing energy in the Bronze Age, I suppose. But it\u2019s not a [mathematically] correct token. And because it\u2019s so easy to confiscate, it\u2019s not really a shared ledger anymore. It\u2019s not shared tokens, right? I can\u2019t share it because I can\u2019t carry it with me. And then that leads us to the third problem with it, which is the hypothecation. It\u2019s too easy to counterfeit and manipulate. And it\u2019s easy to counterfeit because I can either debase the coins themselves, or I can lie about the asset in the vault while I give you a gold note. I either create the gold note and I lie about it or I just debase the coin, and that creates a problem of authenticity. And that leads us to the fourth problem, which is authentication. It\u2019s too expensive to audit and authenticate. In fact, out of everybody that I know, I don\u2019t know a single person that\u2019s ever authenticated a gold coin. You wouldn\u2019t know! Coinage was an attempt to make authentication self-evident. Right? And Isaac Newton worked on how do you create a good coin, and most coins were crappy, but we still struggle with this issue. And so if you can\u2019t authenticate it, then that really undermines the \u201cshared\u201d part of the shared ledger as well, and maybe the correct part. And so transportation is also a defect. It\u2019s too expensive and slow and difficult and dangerous to move. And distribution\u2019s a defect because it\u2019s difficult to move, difficult to authenticate and easy to confiscate. Then that means: how do you distribute it? It\u2019s too difficult to distribute, and too expensive to distribute. And when I talk about distribute I mean, how do I give it to a billion people? Right? I mean, practically speaking, if you distribute up to $1,000 of gold coins to a billion people today, there would be a 35% markup/markdown every time it trades, right? You pay $90 for $60 worth of gold. If you have $60 worth of gold, you\u2019d be lucky to sell it for $40. And so that transfer cost is obscene. And then finally, you\u2019ve got this division issue. How do you divide a one ounce gold coin? You can\u2019t. And so I can\u2019t divide it. So I have to create silver coin and copper coin. And now I never have the right combination of change. So prices don\u2019t work quite right. So gold has \u2014 fundamentally, it\u2019s the best tokenized energy in the Bronze Age. But because of all of these defects, by the Middle Ages it was clear it was going to be replaced with some some type of fiat or some kind of checking system or other paper ledger system. It\u2019s not clear to me that they didn\u2019t replace it \u2014 I talked about the gold myth \u2014 it\u2019s not clear to me they didn\u2019t replace the 2,000 years ago. Like they talk about the Sumerian tablets, right, and the Sumerian tablets of clay \u2014 they have ledgers on them. So, isn\u2019t it quite possible, if not likely, that we had checking systems or ledger systems that were privately enforced by banks thousands and thousands of years ago. So the gold myth is: there never was a gold standard. There was never a time when all money was gold. What you had was a time when the principal asset for a store of value over the long duration was gold. And it\u2019s quite likely that you always had \u2014 you know, the merchant had their ledger and you would have credit with the merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the ancient Roman merchant. And maybe that was a credit with the town. Or maybe that was a credit \u2014 if you were on a ship, anybody that\u2019s ever been on a ship sailing for months at a time, the quartermaster has all the supplies. And if you wanted some of those cigarettes or some of that alcohol, they might let you sign it out, but then they charge your account. And when the voyage is over, they debit it against your wages. And so this has been going on for as long as people have been sailing ships around. What we have is the myth of the gold standard, but we\u2019ve always had an asset currency system, and the currency was a checking system with a central counter-party \u2014 we can call them banks today. But we had goldsmiths that had gold notes back in the Middle Ages. And I think you\u2019ve always had merchants, and you\u2019ve always had quartermasters. And you\u2019ve always had the guy in the army that said, You lose it, we\u2019re going to dock your wages for that, whatever it is you lost or you spent or you consumed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [31:20]: I think this is a really important point to zero in on: so what gold gave us was this reliable medium for final settlement. But it can only be used for large transactions, essentially, because the economics don\u2019t make sense to use it for small transactions. So it doesn\u2019t circulate well but you can settle large transactions with it. So due to that technological limitation of gold \u2014 effectively it had such a high value to weight [ratio], I guess you might say \u2014 that we needed these cheaper systems, these credit systems or derivative systems \u2014 systems of deferred settlement built up around it. And that has been kind of the problem throughout history, because we have this system for final settlement, but we build systems of deferred settlement around it, which are economically more efficient. But they introduce all of this need to trust counter-parties, which comes with counter-party risk which blows up time and time again."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [32:19]: And one of the implications of that is: the socio-political systems we can create are small and local. The implication is city-state, because I have to get my credit from the local merchant. So if the local merchant is 1,000 miles away, the credit system doesn\u2019t work. It breaks down. So I think you can create a trust network that goes about 10 miles or 20 miles \u2014 a trust network out to the suburbs. And then once you get beyond the suburbs, the trust breaks down. And if the trust breaks down, that means you\u2019ve got Renaissance Italy, with 100 different city-states and they\u2019ve all got their own little system of trust and ledgers and coinage. And there is no universal money. And so you can\u2019t have an easy rise of the nation-state under a gold standard or a coinage standard, or at least it\u2019s kind of challenging!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [33:23]: It\u2019s fascinating to me that the actual shape and configuration of our institutions is derived from the nature of our money in a way. The reason we have a central bank is because of gold\u2019s technological limitation. So what it gets me really thinking about is when you swap out gold for Bitcoin, how transformational that potentially is to all the institutions we take for granted today?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [33:50]: Now I think that what we see is the progression of money as technology through the ages. And if you have a better money, you have a better economy. And as the money gets \u2014 if we come back to this issue of: Is it shared? Is it immutable? Is it correct? The greater the sharing, the greater the economy. The more immutable, the higher integrity. The higher the efficiency of the economy, the more correct. The more effective the economy, the faster the network updates, the faster the economy. So just finishing up on gold \u2014 why does gold fail? In theory \u2014 why does gold fail in theory? It fails because the base layer protocol is okay. It\u2019s kind of God-given by nature. It\u2019s the creation and the smelting of gold. It\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s not conservative. The base layer protocol is not conservative. The application level protocol \u2014 that one layer above the base layer, the layer 2 \u2014 the application protocol is difficult and dangerous. But what does that mean? Like so I give you 10 blocks of gold. That\u2019s the base layer. Okay, well, so what are all the applications of gold? What can you do with it? How many people do you know that can actually refine or melt down molten gold and create something with it? That\u2019s the dangerous part and the difficult part. So gold applications, they\u2019re difficult and they\u2019re limited by the laws of physics. And that just means that \u2014 and there is no application protocol. So if I want to do anything with gold above the layer 1 it\u2019s either a very difficult, dangerous application like gold goblets or gold coins or something like that, or I have to create the equivalent of a gold [paper] check, which is a manually implemented protocol. And now we\u2019ve got the same problems we have with a fiat currency. At the point you implement a gold check, you\u2019ve in essence moved on to the Fiat standard with a gold reserve of some sort. So gold fails primarily because there\u2019s no good application protocol. It\u2019s not conservative, it\u2019s too difficult, too slow, too dangerous. And the physicality of it invites violence. I can literally firebomb the city, kill everybody in it, and the gold won\u2019t be damaged. And so when in doubt, shoot first, and then sift through your clothing and take your gold! I don\u2019t have to worry about any collateral damage. The last thing in the world you want to do is be carrying around immutable money on your person. When someone has an incentive just to kill the people and take the money. So that\u2019s the fundamental problem with gold. That\u2019s why the gold standard ultimately has always just been an invitation to war. And never-ending. I think thousands and thousands and thousands of wars \u2014 many wars, right? And an invitation to criminality and an invitation to violence. If the criminals don\u2019t take your gold then the counter-parties take your gold and the counter-parties don\u2019t take your gold then your own government takes your gold and your own government doesn\u2019t take your gold the hostile government takes your gold. But ultimately, gold \u2014 because of its physicality \u2014 is imperfect property. It is imperfect property. And it\u2019s imperfect money, because the token itself is so cumbersome and unwieldy to utilize.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [38:24]: And so this is Bronze Age money as you said, but this contention over gold, it extends right up into the 20th century in World War I and World War II. There\u2019s still massive gold flows taking place geopolitically while those nations are at war. So it\u2019s almost \u2014 I think it\u2019s an ill-understood aspect of human history that a lot of the violence between countries has been over the gold or about the gold. But it\u2019s not often discussed in the history books."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [38:57]: Yeah I mean when you think about it, you never read a historical account where someone says, Yeah, we invaded their country and we killed everybody so we could take their paper currency. I could give you 5,000 accounts of: we sacked the city, we burned it and we took their gold. We might have sacked the city and hauled the people off in slavery. We might have taken their livestock, we prefer to take \u2014 normally the livestock is all dead by the time we take the city though. So the people are dead, the cattle are dead, the food is gone, the water is all gone, but the gold is still there! So generally, if you look at the first 5,000 years, it\u2019s: we sacked the city, we took the gold. Then even in the modern era from 1700, 1800, 1900: We sacked the city. Okay, what do we make off with? There\u2019s not that many diamonds \u2014 normally they\u2019re not easy to find. There\u2019s not a lot of that. Sometimes, you know, the Nazis took the art, right? And the Nazi took the gold. And so there\u2019s a lot of that: we took the gold from the Treasury, Stalin seized the gold during the Spanish Civil War, and the Poles had to smuggle their gold away to keep it from the Nazis. And there\u2019s all sorts of examples of somebody sacking some city or rolling over someone\u2019s border to take their gold. That\u2019s because it\u2019s take-able, right? It\u2019s like, why do you want to take it? Because it\u2019s take-able. But not a single example [for paper currencies]. Like the Nazis didn\u2019t want Norwegian paper currency. They didn\u2019t want Swiss paper currency, they didn\u2019t want the Dutch or the French paper currency. And not many people ask the question, Why? We didn\u2019t take their checks. We didn\u2019t take their securities. Because at the end of the day, securities and derivatives and all these things have no value. Maybe the factory has value. If it\u2019s not destroyed. Maybe the people have value if you get them to work for you. The gold has value but the paper doesn\u2019t.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [41:30]: There\u2019s some examples of the opposite, actually.

It\u2019s basically a metallic token, and it was our best idea, but it seems to have stopped working thousands of years ago. You could say 2,000 years ago almost certainly they had shared ledgers. And they just used gold as a method of final settlement. And we know that it failed at different points. We know that it was debased and resulted in the collapse of the Roman Empire. And so if Rome was the greatest empire on Earth, when their final settlement network failed, then the empire collapsed and what you have is: history is the endless succession of successive empires rising up with the new gold standard that was not debased, and then generation after generation the coinage of that next empire \u2014 the successor empire \u2014 would be debased, and then that empire would fail and collapse. And then another empire would come along and they would start the cycle over and over again. And yet the myth of gold as immutable money or the sovereign store of value \u2014 it stayed with us for thousands of years into the 20th century. I would say that the gold standard has been dying a slow death \u2014 a death by a thousand cuts. 1914 comes along \u2014 you know we\u2019ve got the golden age from 1870\u20131914 but then World War I comes along and then in 1914 every country abandons the gold standard. And maybe that\u2019s the final cut. And after World War I, the Treaty of Genoa, we came back to a gold reserve standard and in essence we had gold backing the pound and the dollar. And that degree of backing successively slid, so there was a debasement of the pound and the dollar, consistently and gradually. And then of course the pound and the dollar became layer 2 applications if you will, and then every other currency became a layer 3 derivative. And then everything else in the economy was built on those derivatives, so you had basically layers of derivatives of gold that got progressively less backed by tangible energy \u2014 or de-nurtured. And that resulted in who knows how many collapses: the Great Depression. Eventually we get World War II which you could say came out of just a bunch of economic collapses like the Weimar Republic. And all the gold ended up getting centralized and seized by the Americans in Fort Knox, and then we wrapped Bretton Woods around it, and Bretton Woods was the second gold reserve standard of the century, except this time just the dollar was the reserve currency, backed some percentage by gold \u2014 say 40% or 30% by gold. And then every year thereafter it slid from 40% to 30% to 20% \u2014 I shudder to say it must have been less than 10% by 1971. And in 1971 we defaulted on the gold standard. In essence, at that point the gold reserve standard was effectively dead. Gold still has a fiction of being a store of value and an asset, and if you\u2019re looking for a non-sovereign store of value between 1971 and the invention of Bitcoin, you could\u2019ve gone to gold, I guess you could\u2019ve used property like land or commodities, timber rights, oil rights, something like that. And you could\u2019ve used art. There\u2019s probably no one king, right? People dabble with, Is silver a store of value? I think the free market went back and forth but it\u2019s pretty clear that gold kind of died \u2014 it started dying if not had died about 10 years ago as far as I can see, when Bitcoin was formed. And if we look at performance in the last 12 months, just for kicks let\u2019s just go and look at 12 months of performance. So it\u2019s quite a day, right? In 12 months Bitcoin is up 240%. Gold is down 9.82%. Over the course of 10 years Bitcoin is up 132% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR), gold is 0.94%. The S&P Index is 13.9% over 10 years. 33% over one year. Summary is: gold is not a store of value over the last decade, it\u2019s something opposite of a store of value. If the S&P is up 33% in 12 months, then a reasonable surrogate for the collapse of purchasing power of the currency in 12 months is the inverse of that, right? But you could say you need 33.7% more money to buy the same share of the S&P. So a store of value has to clock at 33% or better, and gold is -40%, and Bitcoin is +200%. So that\u2019s the marketplace screaming at you that no-one really sees gold as a monetary asset anymore except for the gold bugs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [49:09]: Yeah. One of the key points that jumps out at me here \u2014 getting back to your framework of ideal money \u2014 is that: immutable quality necessitates a proof of work, and gold again was just the best approximation of that. That\u2019s really the only thing that ever made gold money was the proof of work necessary to produce it. It was just really difficult to produce, therefore it minimized counter-party risk."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [49:38]: It was the best token that you could work to produce that you could possibly mould into a coin, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [49:45]: But it then lost relevance in a globalizing society because it wasn\u2019t fast enough."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: The cicadas came out after 17 years and I saw them a month or two ago, and they all come out of the ground at the same time and I watched the cicadas fly around my home and I thought, Those are the stupidest, slowest, weakest creatures I\u2019ve ever seen! Sometimes they would like fly to a branch and they couldn\u2019t land on a branch. They were literally so stupid they couldn\u2019t land on a branch, they could barely fly fast, a lot of them would just accidentally fly into the dirt and slam into the dirt. So when you looked at them and you compared them to other insects, you saw that those other insects are so much better at flying. You take it for granted, but you never really think, Oh those birds are good at flying, they\u2019re fast and strong and smart. Until you see something that isn\u2019t fast and isn\u2019t strong and isn\u2019t smart. And you might say, Well this thing is pretty much history! How could it possibly survive? And the answer is: they all have to birth once every 17 years, and there\u2019s a million of them in the air, and they\u2019re all so stupid and slow and inept that they\u2019re definitely going to die, but all the other creatures aren\u2019t going to be able to kill them fast enough to keep some of them from procreating.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Right. The quantity over quality strategy."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [51:33]: Yeah and I think gold eventually it just fails because it\u2019s not strong enough, it\u2019s not fast enough, it\u2019s not smart enough. And the world goes to the next best thing, and fiat arises not because it\u2019s better than Bitcoin but because there\u2019s no such thing as cryptography and computing. So in a world without computers and without cryptography and without networks, you ask yourself: What are you going to do next? The answer is: I\u2019m going to come up with a shared ledger \u2014 I do have math. We\u2019ve got algebra. We got calculus. I do have writing. I can create a shared ledger. And the immutable part is going to come from the institutional credibility. The credibility of the proprietor and the reputation of the proprietor, whether that\u2019s a king or a mayor or an owner or a religion. But the immutability and the credibility comes from an institutional human source. And the greater the institution, the greater the monetary system. And you have the greatest monetary systems of history associated with the greatest institutions. And then you have the weakest ones: all the way down to somebody on a 80-foot sailing ship in the middle of the Atlantic and there\u2019s a ledger and there\u2019s a quarter-master and there\u2019s 42 people and that\u2019s their money system and they\u2019re trading. It\u2019s a money system which is good for 6 weeks or 8 weeks, but it is life or death for the 8 weeks. And that is the fiat standard and that\u2019s backed by the force of the captain. You have a good captain you might make it, and if you have a bad captain there\u2019s going to be a mutiny and everybody\u2019s going to die.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [53:43]: Yeah it\u2019s a great framework. I love the framework of property and energy because there\u2019s also this deeper notion that most species are territorial. Most social species especially, and that includes humans. And I think we actually express and manage our territoriality through property. And so every little enclave, whether it\u2019s a boat on the ocean or a large piece of land tries to control its most important property because it\u2019s an expression of managing its territory. And that\u2019s why we have these regional monopolies on money we call central banks."}

{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Wow man, I really appreciate that! You know, to be honest, after kind of catching you on a few other spots over the last few months, you\u2019re my favorite Bitcoiner of 2020! I really like the way you speak about Bitcoin and these words you\u2019re going for \u2014 Truth, Freedom, Curiosity, Possibility \u2014 you know, maybe The Great Unseen. So I heard you speak some other spots, like particularly Nico\u2019s show BITVOLT just kind of about where you were going with your life before Bitcoin, what you were trying to do. And I heard you on the Cosmic Deep-Dive, hosted by Jon Chenot. And I was really blown away by the material that you were covering there. You know, I think we\u2019re probably about a decade apart, and I think in this conversation age is just a number \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 but I touch on that because you did these things maybe chronologically after me but I think you took a lot of the feelings and emotions I had and took them further! Or just had a lot of conviction, and I\u2019d kind of like to explore that, if you will. And what I got from that is: you were exploring, you were looking for Truth and the world didn\u2019t always seem fair to you. Or it didn\u2019t seem to speak to you. The externalities seemed a little bit darker than you wanted. So what I\u2019m getting at is: you graduate college \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you went to school \u2014 but you were like, I\u2019m gonna go into the world, I\u2019m gonna make money, I think you went into investment management, but what was really interesting to me there was that you jumped to China! And you wanted to see the future \u2014 you wanted to live it! And I\u2019m really curious to know how big of a decision that was for you? What other things you were thinking about in terms of careers or locations, really? And just some of the things you might have got from China \u2014 was it the future? I\u2019m more talking about the 10 years that you were there, I\u2019m not talking so much about where we are with China now.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [02:56]: Yeah, sure! Yeah in hindsight, reflecting back on it, I\u2019ve always been anti-establishment, anti-authority, not to say that I was a troubled kid. I pretty much was able to maneuver my way by being bad enough that I could have some fun and that kind of thing, but maintaining good enough relationships with older people that I could always smooth it over. But that was always my sense, and I was always a curious kid, and I was fortunate as a youngster to have exposure to a lot of unique individuals, both through travel and through my dad\u2019s occupation and the people he came across. And so I say that only to kind of speculate where or why is it that any of us are more or less curious? That was kind of an open question \u2014 I don\u2019t have an answer to that. But as I grew up, money was something that I recognized as giving you access to the world. Increasing your optionality I guess would be the terminology we\u2019d use today in Bitcoin that you hear a lot! And I also saw the stresses that money placed on my family growing up, and I didn\u2019t want those! I wanted to be free of those! And so I was focused on making \u2014 you know, when I was younger I just wanted to be as rich as possible. But simultaneously \u2014 and totally unintentionally\u2014was just, this is the only definable moment I can really say that it really took flight for me. Because I think we\u2019re all just in the world trying to figure it out, so we all have a certain level of curiosity, of course. But I remember playing with one of the kids on the street when I was 11, 12, and she was my age but she was ahead a year in school. And I was like, What the fuck? I hate school! How are you getting out a year before me? And she was like, Well I just read a lot! And I was like, What the fuck do you mean \u2014 read a lot? That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with what we do in school, does it? And she was like, Well, I dunno! School was just easier for me as a result, so they bumped me up! And so I never got bumped up in school, but I took that as \u2014 that kind of set my mind on fire and I was like, This reading thing must have something to it! [05:18] And so I went back to my dad\u2019s bookshelf that day and picked out a book, and I still remember the book it was! It was Hidden Power: Unleashing the Power of Your Subconscious Mind, which was quite an interesting book to start with! Because I\u2019d never considered even the influence of my subconscious mind till then. And so it was kind of revelatory to me, really, and it probably served as a bit more of a foundation than I\u2019ve ever given it credit to subsequent to reading it. Anyways, I started reading a lot and really enjoyed that, and read all the classic Buffett and Graham investing books when I was in high school because I thought, You know, the way to be rich is to work your money! You don\u2019t want to be a wage slave \u2014 you want to basically make money by rent-seeking of other people\u2019s money! So that\u2019s what the plan was in high school. And I did a rotary exchange after high school \u2014 I was in Japan for a year. And it was probably around that time that I realized that China was the future. I think that was 2004\u20135. I\u2019d done a lot of reading about China with all the books available at the time, and it was very clear to me that the 21st Century was gonna be China\u2019s century, as the US was the 20th Century and the UK was for the 19th Century and so on. And Shanghai was the New York, and so I thought \u2014 I actually didn\u2019t want to go to university, I wanted to actually leave high school at grade 11 and just go! \u2014 but I was corralled out of those decisions. In hindsight, unfortunate, but heigh-ho! And so after I finished university, I went down to South America and spent 3\u20134 months there. Part of that was exploring Ayahuasca and learning about that, and another part was partying a little bit too much and traveling around and backpacking and that sort of thing. And then\u2014to answer your question \u2014 there was no trepidation or it wasn\u2019t a very well thought-out thing, I just said, Shanghai is the New York of the 21st Century, that\u2019s where I wanna be! So I booked a one way ticket and I booked a few nights at a hostel and I said, I\u2019ll figure it out, you know! So I flew home from South America, switched out my bags, filled out my backpack with a few different items and booked a one way ticket to Shanghai. I mean I wanted a job in finance, I put my resume around, didn\u2019t get anything, and then I\u2019m a die-hard UFC fan, a guy on a forum said, We\u2019re watching the fights at a bar one night, I end up going to the bar, sitting next to that guy and he ends up being HR for the biggest ex-pat wealth manager at the time, and so I got an interview, got a job, and worked in that capacity for a few years. And all the while during university I had started to change my tune about the principle aim in life being wealth accumulation, and that coincided with exploring the psychedelic realms, or let\u2019s say different aspects of consciousness via certain psychedelic substances. And you know that leaves an indelible mark on you! It\u2019s really difficult to have those experiences and not be changed, and I think a current of change was already happening in me but that certainly accelerated it. And so it took a little bit of the hunger and edge and whoop-ass and take names of my intent of going to Shanghai \u2014 so when I found myself in the wealth management industry, (1) I was a bit disillusioned because I thought it would be a little bit more sincere in terms of what the role of an asset manager is, but you\u2019re a glorified salesperson and you\u2019re told to sell, sell, sell, basically. And that\u2019s the same pretty much everywhere. And so I ended up not liking the industry, not liking the job, but still wanting to be in China because you know this is where the Bitcoin narrative kind of has really impacted my life is: I hate to say this, but my initial years in China I kind of lost myself, which is weird for me to say because I\u2019ve always been someone who took care of my health and took care of my intellect and tried to learn and tried to grow and tried to continue develop myself and not be wrapped up in a lot of the things that people get wrapped up in, whether they be substance abuse or bad lifestyle habits or bad relationships or all that kind of stuff. [10:05] But my assessment of the world at the time from having consumed a ton of resources about anything I could find about every industry and how it all worked \u2014 we all try to piece together the world in our own ways and that\u2019s what I tried to do. And I wasn\u2019t left with a great impression in terms of what was in store for the world. And so once the kick-ass nature of my desire to go to China and work in Finance dissolved away, I was a little bit left with \u2014 a bit aimless is I guess the way to put it! So I probably didn\u2019t treat myself as well as I should have during that time, but I still felt that China was the place to be: I still thought it was the future and I thought there was opportunity there, and I loved the energy there. I mean Shanghai is a modern city and there\u2019s a great ex-pat population and the young local people are awesome. It\u2019s a really great place to live, if you can handle the pollution. I stayed there and I ended up going back to school for 3 years and I studied natural medicine and then I worked in that capacity in Shanghai also. But I guess it was in 2014 I came across Bitcoin, or finally got in. And then in 2015 I interviewed Bobby Lee who at the time was the head of BTCC which was one of the longest-running Bitcoin exchanges in the world and he was kind of a \u201ccentral figure\u201d or \u201cpopular figure\u201d in the mix of Bitcoin. And that really started turning my perspective around, because\u2014as is so often the case these days when you hear anyone talk about Bitcoin, and I think Saylor has done a great job amplifying that message \u2014 is: Bitcoin is hope! Bitcoin represents so much hope for the future, because it remedies so many of the fundamental issues that plague society and culture and markets and economies today. And that started to dawn on me. And like I think is the case for everybody, you go down the rabbit hole and you say, This is interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Wow! This is really interesting! And then you go a little bit further and you go, Holy shit! And then you go a little further and you find yourself obsessed and not able to really think or do anything else beyond the obligations that you have! And that\u2019s kind of what happened with me. And so I left China in mid-2018, I went down to Thailand and ended up meeting someone there and we just basically have stayed there for over a year. And I find myself stuck in Canada at the moment with the COVID nonsense that\u2019s going on. That\u2019s the closed-notes version of the story. But I think the more relevant point, because that may have been boring to some, what Bitcoin has done for me is \u2014 I mean it dramatically reorients many things in your perspective \u2014 but I kind of thought that like it was a fait accompli that China was gonna take over the world, and it probably still is even if everyone\u2019s on a fair playing field. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s a Bitcoin standard everywhere, I think that\u2019s probably still going to be the case! But because of Bitcoin, it\u2019s kind of reinvigorated everywhere else in the world, and Bitcoin is everywhere, right? And so I can get my rocks off about being at the vanguard of a momentous shift, and one that\u2014far more the case in Bitcoin than in China \u2014 is representative of an extremely positive change, I can be involved in that anywhere. And so part of the reason why I was in Shanghai was I just didn\u2019t want to miss out on it! I thought this was like a massive historical shift and I kind of wanted to be at the center of it! I wanted to be in New York at the turn of the 20th Century, or early 1900s, right? And now I don\u2019t so much feel that pull, because I think the big story\u2014the macro narrative of our time \u2014 is definitely Bitcoin now. And Bitcoin is such that you can be involved in it anywhere! So now it\u2019s sort of re-framed in my mind that the most important thing, and the thing that I most focus on, is maximizing sovereignty and freedom. How can I construct my life so that I have the highest degree of optionality and freedom to live the life I want to with my friends and family and loved ones and all that kind of stuff, and that\u2019s the big story that I think is unfolding for a lot of Bitcoiners right now."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [15:06]: I really appreciate everything you said. There\u2019s lots to unpack there that I want to get into. One of the things you said, I think in the Cosmic Deep Dive, is before Bitcoin, the external world caused you to withdraw, and that there were bright and dark spots then. And I really related to that in the sense that I think in my 20s I really wanted to find Truth and Fairness and Freedom, but I think a lot about this fair side of it, where I didn\u2019t think the world was fair, I didn\u2019t like a lot of what I was encountering in the external world, and I did withdraw! And I really waffled between whether I\u2019m an introvert who built up extroverted skills, or I\u2019m an extrovert who just reverted from the world and didn\u2019t want to deal with a lot that was coming my way. I didn\u2019t feel that I could get ahead fairly. Like you were saying, it seemed that the best way to get ahead was rent-seeking! I remember in college I studied Finance, I learned all the tricks, I learned how really big players made a lot of money. None of it seemed fair to me. I think that was one of the reasons I dreamed \u2014 you know growing up I watched things like Family Ties. I wanted to be an investment banker like Alex P. Keaton and by the time I got there I was like, I don\u2019t want to spend my life doing that! Sucking \u2014 you know, being a parasite! Because I don\u2019t think that \u2014 I recognized that, while the intellectual capacity of the globe was going to Finance, that\u2019s not really what was creating value for the world. You were just moving around digits and monetizing transactions. And so in my 20s I think it made me really think about exploring myself, and I think that was one of the reasons I fell into things like \u201cpartying\u201d or making that kind of lifestyle, where you\u2019re looking to be with your friends, you\u2019re living for today. And it wasn\u2019t until \u2014 I think without Bitcoin I had a lot of despair! The world just seemed dark, and it didn\u2019t seem like a place you could get ahead unless you worked more than other people at some hamster wheel someone else created, or was a rent-seeker. And that was just not fun! And you just looked for fun elsewhere, and you lived for today, I think. One of the things you said that really stuck with me is that at 11 years old you discovered reading, and you went to your father\u2019s bookshelf and you picked off \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard of that book but it has a fascinating title for an 11 year old or any age. So I\u2019m wondering, Did your parents encourage reading? And what I\u2019m getting at there is: Did they encourage curiosity and truth-seeking?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [17:43]: Yeah. I can\u2019t remember \u2014 I think it was 11, 12, 13, somewhere around there. But that was definitely the book. No! They didn\u2019t! There was no encouragement of that type whatsoever. You know, my parents \u2014 I think this is a positive thing: they\u2019ve always been very supportive, which, all you can really ask out of parents is love and support. I mean, because who the fuck knows how to bring another human being into the world, right? What are the best ways to treat a fresh mind and mold it and form it into someone who\u2019s fit to go out into this crazy world and succeed and be happy? Who the fuck knows how to do that? So I think you gotta default into just saying, Did they love you and did they support you in the best way that they could? And in my case the answer was definitely, Yes! But there wasn\u2019t much specific direction of that kind. They weren\u2019t like, Hey man, you gotta read in order to be smart and successful in the future. They just wanted me to go to school, behave, do well at school, and come home and not cause too much trouble! And that\u2019s what I did, but I think maybe why that worked for me is because it just gave me the space to explore on my own and to say like, Nobody is pushing me in one direction or another\u2014I get to choose! And I chose to \u2014 like I said before \u2014 I think I benefited from having certain people in my life as a result of both my family and my dad\u2019s occupation, who in hindsight, I can look back now and say that they were very unique people. And I think for the right type of mind, which was mine, who would be curious about unusual people, I think that fed the flames of my curiosity to say like, Why are those people like that? And what makes them tick? You know, just getting different personalities and looks and types of people \u2014 exposure to them when you\u2019re younger I think is beneficial because you kind of see that its not a cookie-cutter approach to \u201chow people are\u201d. People can be a lot of different ways! And there\u2019s a lot of different positive attributes and negative attributes that people have. And to see that spectrum when you\u2019re young and to perhaps naturally gravitate towards one end of it, like the more curious, unconventional, anti-authoritarian \u2014 however you want to characterize it \u2014 I think that that was an initial push in that direction, and then my own curiosity just took over and it led to this life!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Yeah! Figure out a way to provide more for your family. I think maybe his dream was to be like lawyer and to go into Manhattan with a briefcase, you know? And at the same time, I\u2019m amazed with what they\u2019ve been able to provide for me just by being teachers! And I don\u2019t just the word \u201cjust\u201d there lightly. I mean, they busted their ass and I\u2019m really happy with everything they\u2019ve given me, but it was very striking to me that \u2014 it was a little bit of a lesson of, Take care of yourself, it felt like! It wasn\u2019t trying to teach me to be selfish, but I wonder how much watching your parents deal with money was a lesson, maybe if they weren\u2019t speaking to you about it directly.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [21:39]: Yeah it\u2019s definitely had a profound impact. And look, parents insulate their kids from everything they deem \u2014 that they don\u2019t want their kids to have to concern themselves with, for their own benefit. So I don\u2019t know what the financial situation was at the time, and to be honest I\u2019m not sure it matters much."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Yeah I\u2019m sure it was fine!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: Well I\u2019ve been privy to extremely wealthy families that squabble over money, and extremely poor families that feel the stress of a lack of financial capacity or means or whatever. So it\u2019s almost like the nominal amount of money probably wasn\u2019t the issue. It may very well have been their relationship to money and to wealth and to their spending, and so whatever it was, it was definitely something that was very very seared into my mind, like I don\u2019t want to have that kind of stress in my life. Like I can tell that that kind of stress is unhealthy. That type of stress\u2014it just isn\u2019t good and I didn\u2019t want it. So I think that kind of fostered that desire to really go after money, but as a said, you can\u2019t help what you really believe. And this is something that you only learn maybe when you get older, or for most people. But you can\u2019t fool you. You can fool everybody else for a time, but you can\u2019t fool you. And that\u2019s the tricky part, and that\u2019s the part that requires courage when you come to that \u2014 a lot of people have difficult times in their life, and maybe it\u2019s a crisis moment or maybe it\u2019s just an accumulation of experience where you say like, I gotta just step up and do what feels right and true to me. Not to anybody else, not for any other reason than, This is actually who I currently am, and this is the journey that I\u2019m on, and the place in that journey that I\u2019m at. And you know, that\u2019s difficult! And one of the things that gets me so excited about Bitcoin is that a big impediment to people being actually able to do that is the financial concern, right? Like I have to be Lawyer John because every day I go and be Lawyer John \u2014 if I\u2019m anything other than Lawyer John I can\u2019t put food on the table, I can\u2019t pay my bills, I can\u2019t support my family, whatever it is. But Bitcoin is providing a very very very unique opportunity I think for people to put themselves in a situation where the financial concerns are becoming less and less and ultimately, hopefully, no impediment to them expressing who they truly are! I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s super easy. I mean a big part of my development and all the traveling and escapades that I went on was trying to figure out and refine what exactly that was. And trying to explore. We talk about looking out on the world and being a bit concerned with how it looked and not very motivated to pushing to the future \u2014 that despair that you mentioned. And you know, a big part of my searching \u2014 traveling and trying different experiences and stuff \u2014 was kind of me saying, Surely there\u2019s more than this! Like once you put together a piece of the world and you see maybe it doesn\u2019t look so good to you, you come away with like, Surely there\u2019s more! And I kept just following that impulse and I refused to believe that there was no answer to that question. [25:25] I maintained the belief that surely there was! Again I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s easy to do but I think a lot of people who are set free financially by being involved in Bitcoin now and into the future, I think the degree of sovereignty that permits is going to allow them to have the choice to actually become or be or express who they genuinely are, and I think that\u2019s of huge benefit to the world and of course it\u2019s of massive benefit to the individual, because there\u2019s nothing worse than having to act in a manner that is not genuine. Having to be someone who you\u2019re not. And that characterizes probably most people in the world today, and I\u2019m really excited for more and more people being able to step out of that fa\u00e7ade and start to explore and express who they really are!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [26:20]: Yeah. I can relate to a lot of that! I wonder how much watching our parents \u2014 like my parents were hardworking people. My father even had a second job working at flea markets and kind of just trying to provide more. I don\u2019t know how much what we saw was their relationship to money as to inflation. Because they were doing what they were supposed to do and it was still a struggle to do and accomplish all the things that we wanted or needed. And I use wanted and needed interchangeably there but I know the difference. But it\u2019s interesting you told a particularly interesting anecdote on the Cosmic Deep Dive about \u2014 and I think it relates to what you were talking about with genuineness \u2014 where you came home and you were out drinking with your friends, and instead of telling your parents you were having having snacks with Johnny and Tommy, you were like, This is what I did, I\u2019m a little tired right now, and we can deal with this later. And in that reference point what struck me was you were like, I\u2019m about truth, and if I lie to this important people, all I\u2019m doing is forking reality. And I thought that was a really interesting concept. I also wonder how much \u2014 have you always been a wanderer and are you still a wanderer? Or do you think you were searching for something and you might have found it? I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth, but do you still feel that wandering spirit?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [27:46]: Right. So that story is true, and you said it perfectly! I can\u2019t remember how I articulated it at the Cosmic Deep Dive, but I\u2019ve always felt that way. I always had a reverence for truth, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a little bit more complex, but the most simplest way that it manifested in my mind was, If I don\u2019t tell the truth, then I\u2019ve created a false reality. Right? Both for myself and the person whom I\u2019m lying to. And I\u2019ve always had such a burning curiosity and desire to understand reality. I mean this is what all this searching is about, and this is what going into the jungle and spending time with psychedelic brews and that kind of stuff is all about. It\u2019s like trying to figure out what is really going on here! And it was repugnant to me to be complicit in the creation of illusion, and to fostering more false reality than I already perceived there was \u2014 even at that young age! So that\u2019s why I always did my best to tell the truth, even if it landed me in the hot water sometimes. Now in that particular case it wasn\u2019t that hard because I was already caught red-handed. [28:58] Like, I might as well own up to it because I wasn\u2019t getting out of it! But that has always been definitely something that \u2014 not necessarily intentionally \u2014 I just always felt really uncomfortable to do anything but [tell the truth]. And to the second part: definitely a lot of wandering, for that very reason! But Bitcoin has grounded me, in a way. It\u2019s also caused a lot of my previous interests and education and knowledge acquisition or whatever you want to call all of that, to converge on something that seems to be able to house all of those interests and all of that knowledge, and really give it a gravity and really make it relevant. So in a way I think the wandering has maybe been exacerbated, but it\u2019s been far more focused, right? Like I don\u2019t have to tell you the Bitcoin rabbit hole is very deep and so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m consuming less information these days and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m contemplating what I know and trying to recognize patterns any less. If anything I think it\u2019s more, because Bitcoin kind of forces you to do that, but it\u2019s grounding in that I\u2019m no longer searching for the thing, you know? My universe of really meaningful things \u2014 I\u2019m happy where that is right now! I think Bitcoin is \u2014 well not that it was ever going to be, because it didn\u2019t exist at the beginning of this journey \u2014 but to me it represents a tool that can dissolve a lot of that despair that I previously felt, away. It can restructure and reorient both individuals and as a result of that, the structures and institutions that we see in society. And then once you begin to explore that relationship a bit more, you start to be not just relieved but excited, because you understand the relationship between the money and the individual and the culture. And that I think makes us all excited, and this term \u201cThe Bitcoin Renaissance\u201d that we all often use I think comes from a recognition that this can be the foundation for something amazing, incredible, extraordinary! And so why not feed into that? Why not give that your energy? Your intellectual energy, your financial energy, whatever. Like, how could you not, basically is where I\u2019m at! And I love that, because in my search for meaning before, the psychedelic realms were probably it, right? Taking care of your body and being healthy and all that kind of stuff, but the apex was just the mystery of the psychedelic state of consciousness. Like, what is that? And even though we can\u2019t answer that question, you could tell that it was extremely personal, extremely beneficial experience, and that\u2019s kind of why I kept going back to that well. But, it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s imbalanced if you only derive meaning \u2014 not to say only derive meaning from that realm, but to hold that realm or that experience up as like the apex \u2014 I think it leaves a lot to be desired in meat space, in the physical world. Because you can have this Godlike experience, but you come back down and the world still looks the same, like it doesn\u2019t change anything, and so my greatest hope prior to Bitcoin was that I always believed the world could change in an instant! Because all that needs to happen is that people need to change their minds, and then we\u2019d have a different world. But practically speaking, well that\u2019s not very practical! I mean how do you get 8 Billion people just to change their minds on a dime? And it seemed like the forces at work at society, like yes there were bright spots and maybe even their brightness was growing, but there are also big dark spots and that seemed to be an insurmountable obstacle. And Bitcoin has come around and embodied a lot of those principles actually that are represented in the psychedelic realm as well. Of: individual responsibility and individual sovereignty and control over your own domain, and represented that in the \u201cphysical realm\u201d to actually be a tool to foster a lot of those things. To take individuals who are like-minded \u2014 and I kind of hate this term but let\u2019s say awakened individuals \u2014 people that are kind of waking up from the malaise of the cultural conditioning that so many people are subjected to from the time they\u2019re born, and saying, Something\u2019s off here! How can we make it better? I think Bitcoin represents such a great tool to foster that! And so you put those two things together and I feel like we\u2019re kind of attacking it from both sides, and simultaneously, because of course neither one is restricted to one domain, but of course what I love about Bitcoin and what I love exploring with people that I talk to, is how Bitcoin is changing people! [34:31] And not just their financial circumstances and not just how much optionality they have to move around and that kind of stuff, but like, Why is it affecting what you eat and how you treat your body and who you spend time with? And your aspirations for your family in the future? And the amount of time you spend in nature? And I don\u2019t want to cast too wide a net here and I know everyone has a different experience, but those are very common things that crop up, and I think you could put them all under the category of: People are trying to better themselves in more ways than just their bank account. And so there\u2019s a lot of overlap there with people that were on the psychedelic pursuit and exploring those realms. I just think it\u2019s awesome! So I find that they balance each other well, so to answer your question a little bit more succinctly, I think I have stopped wandering a lot! I\u2019d love to find a place that valued freedom and sovereignty that was settled already \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re there yet \u2014 but I think hopefully in our lifetimes that\u2019ll become clear. And really put down some roots. But otherwise, I can\u2019t imagine being involved in anything more exciting right now, so I\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m gonna be here for a while."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [35:51]: Yeah. It\u2019s really interesting that you bring up the psychedelic realm and some of the truths or things that that unlocks. I think before Bitcoin I felt that things were fake, the world was fake, I was struggling with that. Was it a huge leap of faith with you to be honest with people about your psychedelic explorations? And I\u2019m getting at that more maybe with family but also career-wise? Did you feel that you were putting your career off? At that young age you want to create wealth, you want to seize opportunities, and you also want to \u2014 regardless of how you feel about the external world \u2014 you kind of have to put out your resume and talk about things. Was that a concern of yours at that point? To take that sojourn and even share that with people?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [36:46]: It never was! And this may go back to the, Tell my mom if I could just go to bed and we can deal with this in the morning. To me the trade-off of not expressing how I truly felt about something was never worth it. And that\u2019s probably held me back at least financially in my career or in different domains. I can\u2019t give you a specific reason why, but I\u2019ve never catered to that end. Right? So I think a lot of people cater to the end of climbing the corporate ladder or getting more money or whatever. I always \u2014 the highest priority was that nobody felt that I wasn\u2019t telling them how I really felt about something, that I wasn\u2019t telling the truth. And not even for the other person \u2014 that\u2019s always been for me! I couldn\u2019t put up with being afraid to say something that I actually felt was valuable or that I believed in! The most common place I\u2019ve bumped up against this was with my parents, because I always felt like I was never crazy. I always felt like I could logically justify and articulate why it is I was pursuing what I was pursuing. And even if those things were unconventional from a mainstream perspective, I still felt like I could justify them. And if you wanted to challenge me on them I\u2019d be more than happy to entertain it. But I think my parents and friends and stuff like that figured out early on that you better have your shit together if you\u2019re gonna challenge me on certain things, the things that I\u2019ve chosen to be vocal about or engaged in. Because I don\u2019t do things willy-nilly! Like, I didn\u2019t just go down to \u2014 to use an obvious example \u2014 like my mom was terrified when I told her at 20 or 21 that I was gonna go down to the rainforest for 3\u20134 months and take the most powerful psychedelic known to man and live in a hut with a shaman. Like, you know, for some moms that\u2019s a bit worrying!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: And she can\u2019t run the numbers on the network there! That\u2019s what I get out of it: You\u2019re seeking Truth! But you can\u2019t prove it to others in that realm! That\u2019s a very \u2014 that\u2019s the differentiator for me on that sojourn of yours. Or for anyone who takes that sojourn.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [39:12]: Yeah. 100%! But I would always just say \u2014 or what my point was there is: I didn\u2019t do that in an unprepared or irresponsible manner. Like I would spend the previous several months reading everything that was available, making sure that I knew \u2014 like there\u2019s certain elements on a trip like that that you can\u2019t plan for \u2014 but I knew what I was doing. It wasn\u2019t by accident. I was going to seek something in particular, and that\u2019s what I did! And I could always \u2014 because of that \u2014 justify it and she or other people in my life may not have liked it or respected it or agreed with it, but that\u2019s always been irrelevant to me."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [39:56]: Yeah. I really want to touch on what you said about, Bitcoin is a tool. And when you put it that way it almost demystifies it for me in some regards. When I first heard that, it was sort of mystifying. But now it\u2019s demystifying \u2014 it\u2019s just a tool! You know, you can take a hammer, you could build or you could destroy. And when you put it in that framework, do you think Bitcoin is revelatory, or it\u2019s just something that we found in nature and we wanted it and now it\u2019s here? At some point when Bitcoin is just money, the conversations that we\u2019ve been having around money dwindle a bit. You\u2019ve still gotta educate people about money, saving for their future and stuff, but it\u2019s not so big a deal anymore! It\u2019s just the thing we use! And so in that regard, do you think Bitcoin is a revelation, or just something that we\u2019ve been waiting for and now it\u2019s here?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [41:01]: That\u2019s a big one. I would say that first on a very basic level, we won\u2019t be talking about Bitcoin in 50\u2013100 years. Because it\u2019ll be so fundamental and foundational to the culture and society at that time that it\u2019s not novel anymore. People don\u2019t really talk about the Internet broadly anymore as they did maybe in the early 90\u2019s. Any tool, I guess we value any tool, maybe even revere tools, dependent upon what they permit! What are the possibilities that the tool represents? And to that degree we revere them. And I think what\u2019s happening now is a lot of people that think about this deeply are starting to realize that this tool \u2014 like everything, all technology\u2019s a tool \u2014 everything outside of our physical bodies that we want to use to take action in the world is a tool, right? And I just think what\u2019s happening now is a lot of people are starting to understand what this tool represents for possibility now and into the future. What kind of novel possibilities for action does this tool represent? And I think that\u2019s why the rabbit hole is so deep, and that\u2019s why understanding money is so deep, because when you understand what we use money for and how it\u2019s evolved in the history of money and that kind of stuff, and its implications and the relationship that individuals have with it and how it fosters the culture and the society that gets built on top of it. I think what we\u2019re realizing is that this tool represents a dramatically positive shift in how we relate to one another economically and then of course as a collective where things grow on top of that. So on that level maybe it\u2019s just a tool, but everything speaks to us as more than just what it is. There\u2019s an affect to everything. You may just say value is subjective, so this acorn here that\u2019s on my table now, it\u2019s kind of worthless to me, it\u2019s nothing. But to other people they might really like it, so what\u2019s going on there when people really value something, like what it \u201cmeans\u201d to them is a pretty tricky and deep question, but I think what Bitcoin\u2019s gonna end up doing is allowing us to explore further ourselves about what the potential for human action and human coordination and cooperation is, and what can result from new and novel methods of interacting. And that may sound boring or mechanical, but I don\u2019t think it is. I mean I think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve been talking about, right? We\u2019ve been talking about exploring our own consciousness, exploring the world, trying to tease out who and what we are and what we want to do with this opportunity that we have as being human beings on Earth, and a tool like this dramatically expands those things on many different levels and domains, and that is a deeply deeply meaningful thing and I think that\u2019s part of the reason why it\u2019s being treated with such reverence by the hardcores right now."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [44:45]: I agree with everything you said. And something else you said earlier on one of those podcasts was that Bitcoin self-selects. And I\u2019m kind of curious how maybe Bitcoin changed your behavior, because I find that you were \u2014 like my parents and maybe myself \u2014 Bitcoiners before Bitcoin! Like, trying to find that fair world. Trying to match your internal with your externalities. Trying to find that stasis or that peaceful dynamic. So I\u2019m kind of curious how that changed your behavior. And you said something very early on in the show that you interviewed Bobby Lee. And I remember Bobby Lee as a heightened character in the earlier Bitcoin days, so that was a get! That was someone important to talk to at that time. He was prominent. But up until that point where you were talking, interviewing wasn\u2019t a part of your job-set per se. You were working, you came across Bitcoin, but now all of a sudden you were interviewing someone! I\u2019m kind of curious a little bit about that moment and how you came to change from just learning about Bitcoin to actually interviewing someone and thinking that that was something that \u2014 I don\u2019t know why you thought that would bring you benefit \u2014 I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t! I interview people, it brings me tremendous benefit. But how you came to that notion that you should, could, would interview someone, and how it just changed your behavior personally?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [46:13]: Yeah so to attack the first one, you\u2019re right! The cliche changes that get bandied around as what Bitcoiners do when they fall down the rabbit hole, many of them had already been integrated I guess into my character and into my life, but you cannot discount the impact and the power of hope. And not even just hope, like I was saying before, like not only that the future doesn\u2019t look so dark anymore, but that it looks really really really bright and exciting \u2014 I think part of the reason it inspires change is because like if you don\u2019t have something drawing you forward, then the relevance of novel information that you encounter on a daily basis and even the radar you have up for your sensitivity to acquiring useful knowledge, is dramatically diminished! Because if you don\u2019t see a reason to refine yourself now in order to function better in the future, there\u2019s nothing pulling you forward, then you\u2019re gonna be kind of numb, your sensitivity is gonna be much less to all the things that you could pick up in your environment that could make you more fit for the future. And I think this was part of the reason why so many people today treat their bodies and their minds really poorly! They consume junk television and Netflix and binge-watch all this stuff, several hours a day they stuff their face full of shitty foods, their consciousness is not sensitive to all the different cues and pieces of information and knowledge in their environment that might go toward making them more fit for the future. And so obviously time preference plays into this, but I just think, when you don\u2019t see much on the horizon, there\u2019s no real natural impulse to make yourself more fit to take advantage of it. And if you see really not-good stuff on the horizon, you\u2019re far more incentivized to kind of ignore the noise of information that you might use, and just get your rocks off now! Just go for sensual pleasure! But if you see hope on the horizon, then it shines a spotlight back, and especially the more you learn about the relationship of money to the structure of society, and when you go down that Bitcoin rabbit hole, you see the potential for what it could create in the future, well then the spotlight comes back on you and says, Are you as ready as you could be to take advantage of that? Because that shit\u2019s gonna be awesome! Are you ready? Like, are you taking care of yourself enough? Are you cultivating yourself physically, intellectually, spiritually, all these different ways in order to maximize the benefit of that thing that you now see on the horizon? And I think that\u2019s part of the reason why a lot of Bitcoiners are inspired to change in the ways that they have, and I think we\u2019re just at the beginning of this thing, man! This wasn\u2019t really a big part of the narrative like 3\u20134 years ago. I would say that this whole Bitcoin changes you thing, at least as it\u2019s talked about today, is like 2 years old! Maybe a little bit longer. But it\u2019s really amazing how quickly it can take effect, and that\u2019s why I like to joke what we\u2019re all gonna be like at the next halving \u2014 that\u2019s more than 3 years away! Like, what are we gonna look like then, when people are reporting \u2014 you know I\u2019ve talked to people that got in on March of 2020 and 6 months later they\u2019re telling me all the different dramatic ways they changed their life in 6 months! I mean what happens when it\u2019s a year, 2 years, 4 years? So I think that\u2019s one of the powerful impacts of hope, is that it actually sensitizes you to interact with your environment as though it had greater meaning, because it now held greater purpose and prospects for a better future, whereas before it didn\u2019t. So I feel like that\u2019s one of the ways that it really tunes you to just act differently and treat your environment differently. [50:46] What was the second part of that question?"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: To be honest I was just really focused on what you were saying, and I lost the thread myself! But you know, I want to say my parents were Bitcoiners before Bitcoin: They lived for the future. They always sacrificed today for tomorrow, and they sacrificed themselves for their children. I don\u2019t know what their lives were like before us. But I had despair and I think that\u2019s why in my 20\u2019s I was just seeking pleasure. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not saying I was all about pleasure in the physical world\u2014 but I was living for today. And just trying to enhance myself. Like yourself I spent 5 years actually at one of the Big Four accounting firms, and then I left to go on a 3-month journey through the South-Pacific by myself. Really just to chisel out myself and you know there\u2019s nothing like \u2014 when you\u2019re a tourist and you\u2019re with people you might go see the Grand Canyon but it\u2019s like, What do you think? I don\u2019t know! What do you think?\u2014When you\u2019re by yourself it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t have to be here if I don\u2019t want to be here. Why am I here? Why am I doing whatever I\u2019m doing? Before Bitcoin the external world caused you to withdraw and it would bring dark spots. But one of the things is it\u2019s like, Now the future is brighter! And you did touch on this thing: In the Western World we have a crisis of diseases of despair. And a lot of times when you hear news or narratives, you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s someone\u2019s opinion \u2014 well it\u2019s always someone\u2019s opinion \u2014 but some opinions you hold a little bit more closely or value. So when you said something to that effect, it really struck a chord because I see the despair, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s greater than before! So in my 20\u2019s I\u2019m wandering but in my 30\u2019s I happened to get married, I fell in love, I found my wife, my soul-mate, and I had children. And I kind of had to give the wandering up for them, and give my own despair up for them, and just get it done and not bring it home, and figure out a way to get ahead. And it was a constant scramble, because you\u2019re doing the job, you\u2019re trying to figure it out, and things are always running away from you. But I had to just buckle down and figure it out! There\u2019s no excuses, right? But when I found Bitcoin, things got a lot brighter, because I had \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna say a way out \u2014 but I had control over my own money in the sense that no one could debase it. Not control like censorability or seizability or any of those things, but like, No one\u2019s gonna eff with my money! And that really changed my whole outlook. So I\u2019m just curious what your thoughts are on this crisis of despair for people who haven\u2019t found Bitcoin? And when I say that I don\u2019t want to make it sound like Bitcoin is their salvation, as much as it can be for us \u2014 again I think the salvation comes from within, and we were looking for Bitcoin, that\u2019s why we found it. You said it before: Bitcoin self-selects! Ideas have people, we had that idea in our head for some reason that we needed to find a better way. But what do you make of the despair around the globe and how real or actual or heavy that is?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [54:17]: Yeah as you said, it\u2019s difficult to compare something like that because most people lead lives of quiet desperation and as a result it\u2019s not broadcast, it\u2019s not a statistic, so it\u2019s difficult to compare that across time scales. But I think most people if they\u2019re empathetic enough, if they\u2019re sensitive enough, they\u2019re paying attention enough, they can see that there\u2019s a lot of [despair] in the world today. And it\u2019s covered over in myriad ways and like what I was saying earlier, people don\u2019t act like how they truly feel! They act like how people expect them to, and how they need to act to advance their position whether that be familial, corporate, whatever! Whatever games they\u2019re in, they\u2019re acting in the manner that will advance their position in those games. And on that note you could say that fiat currency is creating a perverse meta-game and it\u2019s creating all these avatars of people that are not acting in accord with who they truly are, but in accord with what the game requires of them. And I think the last year has been really revealing of this. But I try to be empathetic, and I think at a core level we\u2019re all the same, and I think we\u2019re born in different locations to different families in different languages and all that kind of stuff, and as a result we appear different, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything really that separates us on a fundamental level. But people seem to be very confused, I guess is the nicest way to say it! And consumed by fear and not taking it upon themselves to construct their own worldview, but having one imposed on them, and they\u2019re complicit in it, of course. You don\u2019t have to go that way! But most people do, and they end up being a shadow of themselves, and they end up being avatars of this extremely perverse system that we have. And look, I don\u2019t want to be exclusively critical of this. Like, obviously there are bright moments: We could readily admit that people are conditioned by the mainstream media and the nation state and the fiat currency regime, but when you have a nice moment that [it\u2019s] your kids birthday, or when you have a beautiful moment with a loved one, or when a family member \u2014 you know like there are pockets of pure, genuine joy and experience all over at all times \u2014 and to me that\u2019s real. There\u2019s nothing intermediating that experience when it happens for real. But that\u2019s the exception. Most of the time people kind of withdraw into the conditioned, culturally determined behavior that people have come to believe is the most effective way of maneuvering themselves in this world. And I can\u2019t remember who said this quote but I remember as a youngster it always \u2014 I said it to myself often, actually, as a way to console myself for being frustrated and also curious why the world seemed so weird to me\u2014It\u2019s no measure of health to be well-adjusted to a sick society. I want to say it was Krishnamurti but I don\u2019t think it was him."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Was it the kid from Into the Wild? Chris \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: Oh, no I said it might be Jiddu Krishnamurti, the philosopher. But I can\u2019t be sure about that. Anyway, that was a bit of a mantra for me for a time, because I was seeing a lot of what I thought was irrational, crazy behavior around me and wondering why I didn\u2019t feel compelled to mimic it or to engage in the same type of behavior. And my assessment was: The society is quite sick! And I didn\u2019t at the time know that the huge reason for that was the money, I just knew that that was the case, and mainstream media and government and all the rest \u2014 I knew those were all influences. And so that quote and that way of thinking helped me maintain my steadfastness perhaps in not acquiescing and going into that. But to circle back to your question, I think there\u2019s a ton of [despair]. I think the system as it\u2019s structured right now and the siphoning off of wealth surreptitiously from people and also the macro structure of society and culture as a result of being predicated on this unfair monetary system that dominates globally, it\u2019s definitely exacerbating the propensity to fall into despair. [59:43] And all the different downstream effects \u2014 the mental health issues and the substance abuse and the anger and the frustration, and all of these things that are toxic to the individual and to relationships and to society. Obviously they\u2019re all latent within us, but I think it exacerbates them tremendously. And so I think if we wound up on a different monetary standard \u2014 one that could not be corrupted, like Bitcoin, one that was fair for everybody \u2014I think we\u2019d see a lot less of that. And in fact, when I was working in natural health, mind-body medicine or psychophysiology was something I was very interested in, and I\u2019ve said this a bunch only half-jokingly and I actually don\u2019t consider it a joke at all anymore, but I think for a therapist, someone in a therapeutic setting where they\u2019re dealing with these issues all the time now, I think it\u2019s critical that you include education about Bitcoin into the therapeutic stack, because understanding \u2014 I mean a huge element of despair is looking out at your environment and feeling like it doesn\u2019t jive with you. It doesn\u2019t make sense, or it\u2019s overbearing, or there\u2019s no hope, or there\u2019s no place for you in it, you feel alienated and isolated and all this stuff, I feel like if you understood Bitcoin and what it meant for how the external world might change, that would dramatically change your perception of how well you could integrate with the external world. And I think that\u2019s a huge aspect of mental health issues! So I think it should be integrated into the protocol stack, the therapeutic stack for mental health professionals. We\u2019re a long way off of that, but I think it should! So I see a lot less despair, mental health issues, on a Bitcoin standard. I know for a fact that it\u2019s had dramatic impacts on Bitcoiners. I\u2019ve talked with Bitcoiners, and they\u2019ve said this publicly on shows I\u2019ve done with them, that were basically suicidal. I\u2019m not gonna dig into the reasons for that, but that was where they were at. And as a result of grokking Bitcoin and starting to see it, their life has completely turned around! Ended up coming out of that and starting a family and being more financially secure and having hope for the future. And this is a huge part, man, that we haven\u2019t touched on yet, but we talk about Bitcoin as a tool and what kind of affect it has and why it draws out these behaviors and what it means for the future. But one thing that is becoming a more and more clear element of this phenomenon is the people that are communicating with each other, the \u201ccommunity\u201d that\u2019s emerging, the culture that\u2019s around this thing! [1:02:44] Like I\u2019m starting to think \u2014 Number Go Up is hands down the most, what brings people in \u2014 but in a world that\u2019s increasingly divisive and tumultuous and in conflict and vicious and all of this stuff, I think more and more people are gonna be looking at this community of people that are hopeful for the future, committed to intellectual refinement, and have very strong principles and integrity and are expressing themselves genuinely and also like to have fun, like I think part of the reason why we, you and I and everybody listening to this, feel good about being in Bitcoin is definitely the natural attributes of Bitcoin and what that means for how we can conduct our life, but it\u2019s also the fact that I can jump on a call with you now and I know that we\u2019re exactly on the same wavelength! And I can do that and I have done that with hundreds of other Bitcoiners! You know, I do a lot of calls that are not broadcast, and it just amazes me that every time I jump on one it\u2019s like there\u2019s no lag \u2014 we\u2019re immediately running right out of the gate. And going back to that piece about feeling isolated \u2014 you on your journey, me on mine \u2014 we\u2019re kind of looking for meaning and being like, There\u2019s not many people that I feel like I have a connection with, I\u2019m just really not jiving with a lot of people. And then to come into this thing and be like, Holy shit! Now there\u2019s hundreds if not thousands of people that I\u2019m sure when we meet in real life we\u2019re gonna become friends really quickly, and who are thinking like I do and who are articulating themselves in a manner that I articulate myself and there\u2019s so many similarities! And that\u2019s so powerful, man! The power of community! And I think that\u2019s one of the elements of why there\u2019s so much despair, because people are increasingly cut off, but I think that\u2019s also why this phenomenon is gonna be so therapeutic for people and draw so many in, because they see this positive culture emerging from this thing and they\u2019re gonna want to be a part of it!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:04:50]: Yeah. I agree with everything you said and I really recognize that power of community. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve felt that at all since maybe college when you\u2019re spending a lot of time with people and you\u2019re really connect very quickly. I also related a lot to what you said about [being] consumed with fear, and like I said I made a commitment: I have a family\u2014I was gonna get through this thing no matter what! Not through this thing, I am gonna get through this thing no matter what, and I\u2019m gonna do everything I can for them. But before Bitcoin I can relate to that lack of control, and you\u2019re doing everything you can but there are certain elements \u2014 there\u2019s this tool, the money\u2019s the tool \u2014 the denominator is out of control. But before we turn to the really fun stuff that I want to get into with you, I\u2019d love to ask you a little bit about China in the 21st Century \u2014 what you\u2019ve gleaned? You haven\u2019t been there \u2014 I don\u2019t know where you\u2019ve been \u2014 but you left living there in 2018 so it\u2019s about 2\u20133 years, but you still seem to have a lot of conviction about where they\u2019re pivoting going forward regardless of what Bitcoin does! And so I\u2019m just kind of curious a little bit about what you saw in China and why you had this conviction of them being the leader of the 21st Century? I\u2019m not even getting into whether that\u2019s good or bad! Just what is it about that that steers you in that direction, that foresight?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:06:16]: Yeah. So any conversation of China is tainted with the bad things, the evil stuff the government gets up to, right? Obviously I\u2019m no defender of what they do, but when I first tried to understand the world, one question that comes to anybody who looks at this is like, Why is the US \u2014 like in our lifetimes the US has been the dominant global power \u2014 why? That\u2019s a pretty obvious question lurking out there. I remember \u2014 I think it was in high school, maybe it was a little bit after \u2014 but Jared Diamond wrote two books: Guns, Germs, and Steel and Collapse. And he was basically trying to illustrate or explore why the world ended up looking the way it looked. Why does Europe have all the countries that it has? Why is America there and Canada there? And the sovereign individual is probably an extension of that in the 20th and 21th Century, but it basically looks at what are the factors, the technologies, the demographic factors, the geographic factors that lead to the world looking like the way it looks like. And obviously the way the world looks is in constant flux, even though right now it seems pretty set, but I mean if you look at a map of let\u2019s say the geographic boundaries of Europe over the last 1,000 years I mean it\u2019s nothing but fragmentation and consolidation and fragmentation and consolidation and change! Like, that\u2019s just what we do! So why are we at where we\u2019re at right now? And that in addition to China \u2014 I love ancient history, and of course it\u2019s instrumental if you want to understand how the world and humanity has developed. So Ancient Egypt and Ancient Sumeria and the Indus Valley civilizations and Ancient China have always been super interesting to me, and so China\u2019s always had an extremely rich and extremely ancient culture, and a highly developed one! And they were kind of isolated from the world for a large part of their history, but as far as they were concerned, they were top dog for most of their history. They had the most highly advanced civilization that they knew of, and you could make the case that it was! Ancient Chinese history and Chinese culture pre-20th Century is extremely rich and fascinating. So I just looked at it and said, Look, 1.3 Billion people, the geography and the natural resources to support it. They had a difficult time in the 20th Century, a lot of tumult and changes, but things were coalescing into a more organized and efficient state now. And I remember when I first went there, everyone was like, Ah, they\u2019ll never do anything but copy American or European goods \u2014 they\u2019re just not the same, they\u2019re a different breed! I\u2019m like, What are you talking about? We\u2019re all just people responding to our environment! There\u2019s no difference between a Chinese person, an American person, an African person, in what they\u2019re capable of as a human being! It\u2019s all just them responding to their environment and their incentives and all that kind of stuff. So to me it was very clear that China\u2019s story was gonna continue to unfold, and with a population like that and as they became increasingly rich and with the natural resources they had and with a proud legacy of being an advanced dominant civilization in the world prior to the 20th Century, I just felt like that was gonna be the natural order of things! Ultimately I know in the current geopolitical dynamic you may say like, Yeah but the US military is like way way bigger! It\u2019s like, Yeah, well, so is the Spanish military and the Portuguese and the British and the fill in the blank, fill in the blank, fill in the blank. They have a billion more people than the US! They have a lot of space for them. They have resources in their own borders and of course they\u2019ve been going all over the world buying resources. They\u2019re extremely hungry and driven and motivated people. There are no more entrepreneurial, capitalist-minded people I\u2019ve ever come across in all my travels than Chinese people! And their structure of government is deserving of a lot of criticism especially from a freedom point of view, but one, I think a lot of Bitcoiners would be critical of the state apparatus in many jurisdictions. It\u2019s not like one\u2019s good, one\u2019s bad. It\u2019s like degrees of bad that we\u2019re talking about! [1:11:10] And as far as economic development is concerned, I\u2019m a critic of central planning and I think the best way to foster growth and innovation is as an emergent property of free markets, and perhaps their development would\u2019ve been better if they went that way \u2014 who knows \u2014 but I can\u2019t knock the fact that they\u2019ve just set the parameters of the game, and then pretty much let the natural entrepreneurial energy of the people play it, and then pour on some gasoline in different areas where they want to see more development. And I think based on that maybe there\u2019s bubbles forming, but I think the overarching story is: How could you stop that? And even if we go onto a Bitcoin standard where let\u2019s say the playing field is fair and even for all countries in the world \u2014 and now the kicker here is the US is getting a massive head start on the world presumably, at least as individuals, because Bitcoin is probably adopted more in the US than most other countries in the world! And that\u2019s awesome, because that\u2019s gonna be probably a huge determining factor in the future. I also suspect that the PBoC is actually and has been accumulating Bitcoin, but that\u2019s pure speculation. That\u2019s my own feeling about how they operate. But if the world is operating on an even playing field and people can\u2019t manipulate their currencies and it\u2019s strictly a matter of who produces the most and best things that the global market wants, I think China wins at that game ultimately! Now one of the things that may influence that that I\u2019m really excited about, because I don\u2019t like the prospect of any one massive country having a huge asymmetry of power in the world, I think the shift toward \u2014 umbrella term \u2014 the means of production shifting to a local basis, so with the advent of 3D printing and all the stuff we\u2019re seeing now: An individual can generate their own power, they can grow their own food, they can make their own tables and chairs. Like, we\u2019re not there yet but that seems to be the trend that production is coming down to the individual level! And I\u2019m sure there will be other things that people end up doing, but I\u2019m hoping that that brings the locus of power back to the individual and the efficiency gains of these massive states \u2014 these centrally controlled massive states that try to control economies \u2014 will diminish, and if that\u2019s the case, maybe that influences how the geopolitical winds blow and what changes take place. But if things kind of remain on the current trajectory, I mean I just think people, geography, level of wealth now, organization, I think it\u2019s just kind of natural that China will be dominant player in the future whether we like it or not!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:14:29]: Yeah I just want to turn to that notion of China is the future: Do you think that they\u2019re out-playing us through central planning or through the fact that they have 5,000 years of wisdom? And I\u2019m only gonna buttress that up to or contrast that to the fact that \u2014 and I didn\u2019t run the numbers on this, I\u2019m not an historical expert \u2014 but it seems like they moved to the gold standard a little slower than other nations, and that cost their civilization a lot of time, so I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll get everything right! And I\u2019m just coming at this as an agnostic\u2014I don\u2019t know so I\u2019m just curious what you think! But do you think their locus of power comes from the history, or from the fact that they\u2019re more centralized planning? And maybe we could argue that there are other states that are just as centralized. And the notion of centralization. Or is it a combination of both? I\u2019m just curious what you think?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:15:28]: Yeah it\u2019s a weird \u2014 I don\u2019t want to disrespect them \u2014 but it\u2019s a weird mentality they have! Like we just simply can\u2019t appreciate what the 20th Century was like for mainland Chinese people. Like, fill in your number: 50 Million, 100 Million, dead of starvation under Mao, right? And then the Cultural Revolution where all that stuff about the past \u2014 because they felt like the world had become modern and they had lagged behind, and so the \u201cGreat Leap Forward\u201d was basically: Do away with history, all of that tradition, that\u2019s holding us back! We\u2019ve gotta modernize and move forward! And so they destroyed ancient monuments and they tried to basically destroy the culture so that nobody would be focusing on that, and everyone would be aligned on moving forward. And you know, under that form of communism \u2014 and that was horrible, the society at that time\u2014and when I went there in 2009 and probably today in certain pockets but increasingly rare, but when I went there in 2009 you could still see vestiges of like the abject poverty and the kind of toll it took on people\u2019s mentality, to the point that now, still, the cultural mentality of the people is like, it\u2019s a bit weird! If you\u2019re under 40 that\u2019s less and less the case, but there\u2019s still a generation of people alive today, people that are 40+ that experienced a lot of that stuff. So on the one hand they know that they had this glorious past, this rich culture, but they also know that it was basically shaken out of them! And so now the nation identity \u2014 I mean they\u2019re very nationalistic people. Obviously they propagandize and all that kind of stuff, but like, basically they think this is China reascending. And the opportunity is right there in front of \u2019em and they want to get after it both for themselves and for \u201cthe glory of the nation\u201d. And so that\u2019s how people feel! And for younger people \u2014 and to kind of answer the question about how I feel it\u2019ll shake out \u2014 regardless of central planning and government structure and Bitcoin and fiat currency and whatever, the people under 40 that I knew in China, and it was pretty consistent this way, was: I meet them and you could see it in their eyes that they\u2019re curious about the world, right? They want to learn about the world, they want to travel, they want to educate themselves, they want to dress well, they want to kick ass in their chosen field. Like they\u2019re a really well put together people that are focused on \u2014 eyes on the prize, right? They know that a better life awaits, they know the opportunity, they want to get after it! Because it\u2019s been held back from them for so long! Versus, on the Western World, obviously as a result of having had it for so long there\u2019s an element of complacency \u2014 obviously in varying degrees to different people \u2014 and I hate to be too critical of our culture, but a big portion of the culture goes to work so they can come home and watch Netflix and chill out on the sofa until it\u2019s time to go to bed. Like there\u2019s not much drive beyond doing what is necessary to get by! And in China, honestly man, like that\u2019s why cities like Shanghai and Beijing and Shenzhen have such a strong energy, because everyone is after it really hard! And that\u2019s a tough thing to beat! Like people will work their goddamn asses off! It doesn\u2019t matter what the job. Like there is just such a hustle and bustle there! And I don\u2019t feel that\u2019s gonna stop anytime soon. So I think that\u2019ll feed into the economic and geopolitical dynamic that plays out."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:19:26]: Yeah. It\u2019s a great insight! Before we turn to your awesome article, After An Unforgettable Year, I\u2019m Most Bullish on Bitcoiners, I really want to bring up another article that you\u2019ve published on Twitter, it was just a great post. This was on December 16th: Just fuck me already, Bitcoin! John, this broke me! I didn\u2019t see it on December 16th, I was researching you, I went down your timeline, this just absolutely floored me. I think this took absolute balls and chutzpah to post! I\u2019m a married man, my wife would throw me out of the house if I posted this! But I want to know what you were getting at? What feeling were you trying to capture?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:20:16]: Well, I mean what I was capturing was: Bitcoin was flirting with its all-time high and it had been flirting there for a while. And I mean you know when you\u2019re a younger man perhaps and you\u2019re doing this traveling around the world, you come across the odd lady and you know there\u2019s an element of playfulness and teasing and stuff. And you know maybe we\u2019ve all been in a situation where like the foreplay is done and you want to get on with it! And I think that Tweet in particular was obviously spoken from the female side of things if we\u2019re gonna frame it up that way. But no it was like, Bitcoin had been flirting with the all-time high like, C\u2019mon let\u2019s go! And what\u2019s funny about that Tweet is I don\u2019t think it was long after, but things really rocketed up after that one, which is why I think it became kind of a funny Tweet because it seemed like it was speaking to the gods of Bitcoiners, speaking to Satoshi or something like that!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:21:17]: It reminds me of something \u2014 I used to listen to Mike Rappaport podcast before I got a little sick of him. And he would say, You fuck you! And you could interpret that in so many different ways! It just really floored me and I really applaud you for Tweeting it out. So I\u2019m gonna ask you: Why are you so bullish on Bitcoiners?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:21:40]: Well I mean I think we\u2019ve touched on a lot of it in the course of this conversation, but to me it just keeps coming back to what we were saying: Bitcoin is an amazing tool, and represents so much possibility, but it\u2019s us who use the tools, right? And we shape our tools and we are shaped by our tools. So the story here is the changes in behavior, the changes in the methods and ways in which we interact with one another, and in which we interact with our future selves of course. That\u2019s the story here! That\u2019s the phenomenon! The attention gets placed on Bitcoin obviously because it\u2019s the novel tool that\u2019s emerged to let all this happen, but we are the story here, and the changes that happen in people as a result of this tool emerging and obviously importantly using this tool to maximum effect, to its maximum potential, the effects it has on individuals and the community that it creates \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s the phenomenon! How could it be any other way? Bitcoin is just a nothingburger if we don\u2019t use it and engage with it to actually interact in novel ways. And so that\u2019s kind of what I was getting at with that article, and the fact that I\u2019ve just been \u2014 I guess as a result of that being true or as proof that that is true \u2014 I\u2019ve had the good fortune to interact with so many Bitcoiners through the podcast and through other means and hearing the stories of genuine transformation! And irregardless of age, sex, creed, nationality, whatever \u2014 I often come back to the example of Michael Saylor: It can\u2019t just be the fact that people are getting wealthier as a result of owning Bitcoin and the price going up, because here\u2019s a guy who was already extremely wealthy, and once he went down the Bitcoin rabbit hole like it\u2019s very apparent all over his face and his \u2014 you know? You can tell that this guy was changed by this thing! I think he was probably \u2014 we were discussing before, like \u2014 a bit of aimlessness, a bit of despair as a result of thinking, Is this it? Is this all there is, world, that you\u2019ve got for me? And then having this thing emerge and having the world expand as a result of this thing emerging, right? Our worlds have expanded dramatically as a result of this new tool! And people seem to be changing in dramatic and consistent ways as a result of the emergence of that tool. And going back to that phenomenon of our tools shaping us. And it was also going back to what I was saying about the psychedelic \u2014 you know, when I was kind of hanging my hat on the capacity for [the] psychedelic, or the change in consciousness or mindset to change the world, you know there was no real tool to foster that en masse. And with Bitcoin now I think we have one! By whatever means you come in, Number Go Up or the community or sovereignty or protecting from inflation or whatever, I think if you stay with it, like if you pay enough attention to it, it starts to change you! I mean this is the very consistent message in the community: Bitcoin changes you! [1:24:57] And I\u2019m so stoked by the type of changes that I see in people! And to a certain degree I\u2019ve seen in myself! That\u2019s how the world gets better, is people! Upgrade people\u2014upgrade the world. We always say, Fix the money, fix the world. But it really is: Upgrade people, upgrade the world, because that\u2019s all the world is. It\u2019s just us here on this rock. And I\u2019ve met so many \u2014 I can\u2019t say it enough man. I\u2019ve had very good fortune to have very good friends and relationships in my life: family and friends and stuff. I\u2019ve got a lot of love in my life. But it\u2019s definitely been the case that I\u2019ve always been a bit of a \u2014 felt somewhat isolated intellectually let\u2019s say. And now to see all these people from all over the world having kind of a simultaneous awakening, and like I was saying earlier \u2014 I mean I could just pick up the phone and talk to them like we\u2019ve known each other for 10 years \u2014 kind of like what we\u2019re doing right now, as a result of the seemingly consistent changes that this thing engenders in people, is nothing short of amazing! So both on a larger macro scale of seeing these positive changes in individuals, but also on a selfish individual scale saying like, Man, the number of people that I feel connected to now has grown exponentially, has exploded as a result of Bitcoin and my involvement in it! And I think that\u2019s the case for a lot of Bitcoiners! The connection, again back to that despair component, that\u2019s one of the things that make human beings happy, is genuine connection with other human beings! And the fact that Bitcoin is fostering that with like, a lot of other people, is amazing! And I think we\u2019re just starting to see the effects."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:26:59]: Yeah the only thing I want to add on that tip is, Yeah I\u2019m amazed by the connections. And the instant vibe, and I think that speaks to \u2014 I stopped making connections like this when I graduated college. And pre-graduating college my world was guaranteed in terms of I just did what I had to do and everything was paid for in terms of either loans or financial assistance from my parents. And then I was out on my own and the world was running away from me and it was a lot harder to connect to people in an unfair world where no one has time to spend on each other! But like I said before: I think you\u2019re the dopest, freshest Bitcoiner in my mind this year. We all have longstanding people that have influenced us and we really relate to or gleaned a lot from, but in this past year of my exploring \u2014 especially as a podcaster \u2014 there\u2019s no one I want to hear more than you! I really enjoy your outlook, especially when \u2014 you know I love your podcast \u2014 but I love hearing you outside your podcast because I get to hear you! And you speaking on it instead of you asking questions! But I don\u2019t want to hear anyone else ask questions \u2014 I love your questions! But I love your answers, too.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: Man I really appreciate that. For real, and it\u2019s an honor to hear that."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:28:16]: It\u2019s the truth. And we got this new thing up around here now which is Bitcoin Clubhouse. And I have mixed feelings about Bitcoin Clubhouse \u2014 not bad \u2014 but like I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like going to the opera, it\u2019s not a polished show, it\u2019s not a one-on-one, deep heavy conversation, but I like the fire, I like the ephemeral spontaneity, I like the ability to connect. And I think you were in there for the first time yesterday, but I did get to hear you in the Peter Schiff room, and I\u2019m not trying to get into the Peter Schiff thing too much, but I just loved hearing you. But I also just really enjoyed your questions to him, and so I\u2019ll speak it out a little bit from what I remember, I\u2019ll paraphrase. So you asked him, Peter, what would it take for you to understand and/or admit that other people know something you don\u2019t? Or understand something you don\u2019t? And he gibber-gabbered and didn\u2019t really answer that question and I appreciated the fact that you said that that doesn\u2019t really answer the question. But I want to know from you, what did you take from that interaction? What did you take from that? Did you enjoy that interaction?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:29:33]: Well I mean I was cooking beef when Cory called me up so I was entirely unprepared \u2014 I mean I was just lurking right? I was just in the audience listening to it all go down. But look, we all feel the same about Peter, right? He\u2019s out of his goddamn mind! There\u2019s no convincing him, clearly! So I didn\u2019t want to go in with something like, How can you say intrinsic value? We all know value is subjective! Or something like that, because none of that plays with Peter. So I tried to ask a question that maybe got away from speaking past each other on specific terms and stuff like that. I knew he would do his typical thing and route around it. But I just kind of wanted to hear him admit, and I think he did kind of show his hand, because I said, What would it take for you to \u2014 I said something about ego and hubris and if you really want to learn we have to engage in discourse where we genuinely allow for the possibility that the person we\u2019re speaking with might understand something that we don\u2019t? I mean what is the point of the conversation if you\u2019re not gonna grant that to the person you\u2019re speaking with? And his answer was, Yeah but what is it that I don\u2019t know? And I think everyone in the audience \u2014 you know? Exactly! That exactly characterizes his entire perspective and his approach to this. I think maybe in hindsight a better question would have been simply like, Have you ever read cover-to-cover a book about Bitcoin? And I think his answer would be No. And I think it would be great to say to him like, You\u2019re speaking from a position of presumed authority on this subject and there\u2019s a certain cohort of people that actually value your opinion and are listening to you as if you are educated on the subject, and if you haven\u2019t even taken any time to educate yourself on the subject when anyone in this space will tell you that it takes a lot of self-education to really come to understand what this thing is \u2014 I mean every Bitcoin that I talk to is like, Half my day is trying to continue to try to understand and learn about this thing! And certainly when you first got into it you were probably set on fire and just consumed every resource you could get your hands on. And for you not to do that but still presume to speak from a position of authority is a profound moral failing on your part! And so if I had my time back I maybe would\u2019ve went that route, but I think at this point and for a long time, the only reason why I don\u2019t get a ton of enjoyment out of it is because I don\u2019t like that people are being misguided by his opinion, but as far as entertainment value, I kind of love that he\u2019s around! That he\u2019s just this irrational holdout that\u2019s kind of never gonna capitulate that we can kind of just use as a punching bag for fun as we march towards hyperbitcoinization. And it makes the process fun. This isn\u2019t all serious at the end of the day. No good revolution doesn\u2019t have some fun mixed into it, and this is a revolution. And us Bitcoiners gotta get our kick somewhere and I think Peter Schiff is probably one of them!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:32:46]: Yeah word up. I agree. I really vacillate between playing with the foil or just leave \u2019em alone.

{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: But I believed him when he was talking to you! I didn\u2019t think he was lying when I heard him in real life! So I don\u2019t know. And you know what? At the end of the day it doesn\u2019t matter because Peter Schiff if just another brick in the wall. It doesn\u2019t matter, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m more inclined to leave him alone. But I like fuckin\u2019 with him too \u2014 I\u2019ll go at him on Twitter and I don\u2019t mind because it\u2019s entertainment for me, but I do think it\u2019s a scam, just like everyone\u2019s a scammer.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:34:06]: Well I agree with that. And he\u2019s definitely, obviously engagement-farming."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Yes engagement-farming, that\u2019s the number one scam.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: Right. But Occam\u2019s Razor, right, is that like he\u2019s accumulating and that\u2019s what a lot of people say on Twitter, but I actually don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case! I think he\u2019s literally that stubborn or crazy or whatever you want to call it, and he\u2019s that closed-minded to it that he\u2019s really being serious! And yes he\u2019s engagement-farming from Bitcoiners, so that he can grow his gold business, but I think he\u2019s actually that crazy and that\u2019s hard for a lot of us to believe because it\u2019s so goddamn obvious to us because the case for Bitcoin is \u2014like it\u2019s not even a counterculture and it\u2019s not even a contrarian bet anymore. I mean BlackRock and BNY Mellon and corporates and Tesla, like it\u2019s not even a contrarian bet, but you know I still think he\u2019s not gettin\u2019 it!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: And you asked the best question possible. Because you were brought up for a question, and I didn\u2019t know if you had been sittin\u2019 on it, or you came up with on the spot, but it was the best question. It was the question of like, What would it take for you to admit that you\u2019re wrong? What number? What fact? What data point? And talked about, you know, he lost money, he lost his password, Voorhees didn\u2019t set him up right. I mean, it didn\u2019t go anywhere! And he had no ground to stand on. And one of the things he said was, I still regret that I didn\u2019t buy it at $10. So to me it\u2019s very clear that \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:36:57]: He said, I regret nobody convinced me to buy at $10. And I\u2019m like, Dude!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Whatever! Yeah someone else! Right! But I think his son is smart as a whip! I think most people are smart as a whip, they just gotta choose to exercise it. [Peter\u2019s] a smart dude and his son is probably smarter, or just as smart. And I think he\u2019s listening to his son. I don\u2019t buy it at all! I think he\u2019s trying to play sides of his mouth.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:37:22]: You know this brings up a broader point and I guess my question was somewhat addressing this, that when we talk about what kind of changes Bitcoin is gonna have or what kinda impacts it\u2019s gonna have, and this is clearly evident in the Bitcoin community at least in as far as it\u2019s represented on Twitter, is like, I\u2019m hoping \u2014 and I think you can observe this now \u2014 that as people are able to opt out of the old system, the old job, like you asked me like was I afraid of speaking my mind, when people are less and less afraid of speaking their mind, like how they really feel because they\u2019re not afraid of the consequences, they are not afraid of the axe falling. They\u2019re sovereign! Like when they are sovereign, you can say what you want and not be afraid of the consequences. But I\u2019m hoping that what comes from that among other things is that people will both develop better principles and values internally, and will hold people to account more to \u2014 will judge people more on their principles and values rather than just their position or their wealth or whatever. And so I do think we see that in Bitcoin Twitter where sure you can be successful, you can be rich, you can be whatever, but if you\u2019re caught being disingenuous, being dishonest, promoting something that\u2019s totally self-serving or all these things, people get called out! And I love that! I want to see more of that! And I think Bitcoin is a great tool for that as well because it kind of shines a spotlight on bullshit and I think someone like Peter Schiff \u2014 that\u2019s kind of why I asked that question \u2014 because it is a moral issue that you don\u2019t engage in conversation as though the person you\u2019re speaking to had anything from which you could learn! Right? To presume that your knowledge is complete \u2014 that\u2019s a moral failing! And I hope that as we become more sovereign, our lips become looser, but our conviction and our principles and our values become stronger, and we hold people to account more on those variables, not on the typical ones of status and wealth and that kind of stuff. And I see that that\u2019s what happens now in the very small Bitcoin Twitter community, and I\u2019m hoping that that proliferates further."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: I think that I can always overcome anything in my way! I have a lot of faith in myself!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: So you can overcome anything but the situation is daunting?"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: It\u2019s just always getting dire! And always getting worse! And no one was hearing it. No one was waking up to it. And to be honest I think it\u2019s gonna take a generation and a half for people to recognize and reflect on Bitcoin and change their behavior en masse. You know? I think we\u2019re a select \u2014 not a select few like we\u2019re special, I\u2019m not trying to say we\u2019re special \u2014but we\u2019re early, is what I mean. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s permeating as quickly\u2014even if people make gains\u2014what this thing is, that it\u2019s this tool, that it could change their behavior, that it will change their behavior! But I do think that they will be forced to change their behavior, and that it will take a generation and a half. It will take our children and even our children will be subjected to what their parents think of for the last 5 years and the next 5 years. And I don\u2019t think everyone\u2019s coming around very quickly. Most people think of it still as Magic Internet Money, Super Mario coins, it\u2019s not real. They don\u2019t see their dollars shrinking or they get stocks and the stocks go up 20% a year and that\u2019s good enough, even though that\u2019s keeping up with inflation. I don\u2019t have a lot of faith. Again I\u2019m an eternal optimist, I think it\u2019s going to work out! I think we now have the tool to solve this problem for ourselves, but I think it\u2019s gonna take a long time for it to affect people en masse. But that being said, for me it\u2019s been eye-opening because I now feel freedom that I\u2019ve never felt before! A freedom that comes from being able to grasp something that I couldn\u2019t get in my hands before and now I have it. And no one can take it away from me metaphorically \u2014 I could lose it, I could spend it, but no one can take it from me! No one could debase it! And that\u2019s a really big deal! So now I\u2019m an eternal optimist but I\u2019m a little bit more inwardly pessimistic about everyone getting on board. But now I\u2019m very optimistic for myself \u2014 I\u2019ve got the keys in my hand! And before this I was afraid that I would never get the keys in my hand, that it would always be out of my reach and that I would always have to do someone else\u2019s bidding to get there. Now the bidding is my own.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:42:28]: 100%. And I mean I think we all try to manage our expectations on this stuff so that we\u2019re not disappointed how fast we progress, but I will say that freedom is at first scary and then it\u2019s intoxicating! And that\u2019s been my experience, because freedom is the assumption of responsibility, right? So I think that at first is very scary, people are not used to that. But once you do it and you get comfortable with it, then you just want to do it everywhere. You get addicted to that sense of freedom and sovereignty. So I think that\u2019s what\u2019s going on. I think once this narrative really breaks through like what\u2019s happening in the macro landscape and what Bitcoin represents, I can see scenarios where it happens way quicker than we all might expect. But I do try to remind myself that as is often said in this space, The future is here it\u2019s just not evenly distributed, but another way I look at it is: Everything is always in flux. There is no stasis. So when I try to imagine a future point in time where the Bitcoin Renaissance is well under way, I try not to look at reality in terms of where we are as a static current moment and where we will be at a static future moment. Like, it will always be underway! There will always be more things we\u2019re striving for, more things that are changing. And that\u2019s just the way it is. So when I think about, When will this happen? When will it be adopted? When will people change? Well the answer is some people \u2014 and a growing number of people \u2014 are actually having that transformation now! And that\u2019s awesome! And look at this great community that\u2019s growing up as a result of it. Other people it\u2019ll take them another 5 years and then they\u2019ll come in, another 10 years, another 50 years, you know? So we don\u2019t want everything to be the same everywhere at the same time, right? And that could never be the case anyways! And I think that\u2019s maybe an outlook that allows you to be a little bit more accepting of the ups and downs and the unexpected things that the flow of time throws at you, because you\u2019re kind of like, I\u2019m not gonna hang all of my hopes and dreams on some imagined reality coming to pass in the future. Because there\u2019s getting there anyways! I\u2019ll just be passing through that place if it even happens at all. [1:44:49] That\u2019s why speaking about values and principles and this journey that we\u2019ve both seen when we were younger of just trying to find ourselves and find meaning and understand the world, I think part of the reason we do that is because we know that there\u2019s something inside of us, and perhaps in that realm of things, that can be immutable and unchanging, right? Like, that I know who I\u2019m gonna be and the principles that are gonna guide me and the values I\u2019m gonna hold, irrespective of the circumstances that surround me! And there\u2019s something really liberating about that, because it\u2019s saying that no matter what happens in the world, no matter what happens in my environment, those things are still my anchor, those are me. And I think that\u2019s powerful and in a way that maybe I can\u2019t explain right now, but it gives you a sense of comfort maybe about the chaos of the external world, and having a North Star to guide you through all of that. And maybe that\u2019s part of the function that religion has served in the past, and maybe that\u2019s part of the reason, the motivation behind spiritual seeking and that sort of stuff, but I think that\u2019s one of the main benefits of taking the time or being on a continuous journey of self-understanding and refinement, is finding those things about yourself that you kind of know are immutable and unchanging, and using them to give you some level of comfort about the uncertainty of the future and the world around you."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:46:29]: Yeah. I just want to sound out on you! So I\u2019m gonna leave the parting words with you. I agree with everything you\u2019ve just said, and you know I just want to ask you, Where do you think you\u2019re going? Where do you want to be in 20 years? Almost aside from Bitcoin! What would be meaningful to you to accomplish over the next 20 years? Not where you want to start in 20 years. What would be meaningful to you? And that could include Bitcoin of course, but how do you want to spend your time?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis [1:47:08]: That\u2019s a great and tough question! I think I have a two-part answer to that: One is, that\u2019s a question that I kind of \u2014 and maybe we all \u2014 obsess over as we go through life, that we want to have some idea of what the future holds and what the best use of our time is and what\u2019s gonna make us feel the best about life in general. And I think this has been largely a result of Bitcoin. I don\u2019t think I answered earlier when you asked me what specific behaviors have changed in me as a result of Bitcoin, but I think part of it is letting go into kind of a faith that if you can just show up as yourself with your genuine curiosity and not be afraid to speak the truth and connect with like-minded people that you think are good people and you wanna connect with \u2014 like if you do that and you have a faith to push into that, then I kind of feel like the result of that is the best you could hope for! So I could say like, Well I want to be the head of a billion-dollar media company in 20 years. But that\u2019s just arbitrary! Like, that\u2019s just giving an answer. And I\u2019m starting to realize that the best thing for me to follow internally is what gives me energy when I do it! What feels right! What aligns with my principles. What do I really enjoy doing? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m just beginning to understand how to interpret that and how to push into it. Because most of my life has been \u2014 I\u2019ve always been a bit spontaneous, but I\u2019ve tried to graft an imagined future onto my life in my past, and I think that\u2019s shifting a bit now to just saying, Look, I have a certain degree of freedom. I\u2019m really interested in certain things. I just wanna be myself and see what happens, basically! But a bit more of a detailed answer is: I love spending time with people \u2014 well I\u2019ll paint you my ideal scenario, and that\u2019ll probably \u2014 a picture says a thousand words. But at some point in the future, I\u2019d love to be in a natural environment, whether it\u2019s rural Canada, rural Mexico, rural Thailand, wherever, just a beautiful environment \u2014 mountains, beaches, lakes, rivers, that kind of thing \u2014 and have a place that\u2019s set up first of all for the things that I love to do. So I love to train Muay Thai and MMA and work out and go for swims and go for hikes and just be active and in nature and that kind of thing, and be with others who are just doing the same, because I love the vibe when you\u2019re doing something difficult together and then afterwards you hang out and you talk about how hard it was and the camaraderie there. And have it be an environment where people can come and have these peak experiences that I\u2019ve explored in the psychedelic realm. So basically combining health and fitness and wellness with these peak experiences that I think are incredibly beneficial and therapeutic to people. And then mic\u2019ing up and having whatever conversation we like to have! I mean you also asked me earlier why I interviewed Bobby the first time. And the answer is two-fold: One, his office was \u2014 I could see his office from my apartment window, it was right across the street. But the other answer is, even at that time it wasn\u2019t only Bitcoin-focused, but I was working in Shanghai and I was like, This is not enough! My job is not satisfying me, and the tech industry was really booming there at the time and really getting underway. And I liked that industry because I felt that it was solutions-oriented and it was building solutions to our problems instead of just complaining about things! And I was like, I\u2019m gonna reach out to these people and say, How about we record a chat? And that\u2019s a weird thing to do, and I got a lot of No\u2019s, but once I got the ball rolling and people realized I wasn\u2019t crazy, then I would get referrals from people and say, Do you know anybody else doing interesting stuff? And Bobby I think I hit him up individually and he referred me to some other people. But yeah man like what\u2019s better than hanging out with someone and feeling good and then mic\u2019ing up with no time horizon and saying like, What do you want to explore? Let\u2019s hit it! Let\u2019s go deep in any direction and see what we come up with! And maybe we don\u2019t come up with anything novel and just connect, and maybe we do come up with something unique and we both learn something! You know that\u2019s kind of the ideal day for me. And of course family and all that kind of stuff, but yeah that\u2019s what the vision looks like right now. We\u2019ll see how it turns out. So I think that\u2019s a vague kind of goal, but the guiding force is just, We are all starting to have this opportunity where we really can experience what freedom and sovereignty is, and I think we should take advantage of that by allowing ourselves to be who we are and continue to try to understand what and who that is, and shove it out there in the world and see what happens!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:52:44]: Yeah man! John this has been so wild. I really enjoyed this and I could listen to you forever. I want you to share with people where they could find you. They definitely should check out the Bitcoin Rapid-Fire Podcast. You got two segments there where you do full chats with people I believe, and then you\u2019ve got the rapid-fire where you just get a quick glimpse of someone!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: Let me ask you a question! I\u2019ve got a question for ya! So I started that [podcast] because like you said I wanted to do an open kind of conversation and then do some rapid-fire questions at the end just to kind of delve into people\u2019s minds, a bit of human interest. And it actually is kind of fun to hear how different people answer rapid-fire questions, although I\u2019ve given it up recently because I just more enjoy the open conversations. But lately if I\u2019m just having long-form discussions with people, like 2-hour discussions, then a podcast titled Rapid-Fire may be somewhat misleading or confusing! What\u2019s in a name for you?"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Yeah man! I\u2019m looking to leave all this out of the chat, but like I think that it\u2019s confusing to me in the sense that \u2014 the title\u2019s not confusing to me \u2014 but the dilemma. Because it\u2019s like, do I get 30 minutes of this dude and sum it up? Or do I go the full 2-hours? You know? And I would probably put it into two separate channels, just because I don\u2019t think that one takes away from the other, but as someone who \u2014 I always want to go full-bore. Me personally. And that like Rapid-Fire I\u2019m like, Well maybe I could just cheat-code it! So it\u2019s a dilemma for me. But at the end of the day man I love what you\u2019re doing. I love both of \u2018em! And I don\u2019t care, I mean what do we care? If they want to they will listen to it. And you see the numbers, but like, I like the long form, for me. Because that\u2019s just more meaningful for me! And the short form has a purpose, I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t, but if I see both maybe I\u2019ll jump on the short form and skip the long form, I don\u2019t know! But dude seriously, I really just want to hear you everywhere! I don\u2019t even want to hear you interview people, and I love your interviews. But I love hearing you and what your thoughts are! And I think that\u2019s really hard to get that across in an interview because you could share, but I just want to hear you speak. I think that you have a really interesting perspective on this outside of money, you know? You\u2019re on that philosophical bent! What is this doing for us? Because at the end of the day it\u2019s a tool, and it\u2019s just a tool! It\u2019s maybe the greatest tool we\u2019ve ever invented, but I don\u2019t know, maybe fire is! Maybe the printing press is. Maybe the Internet is. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna play out over the next 5,000 years, what made one thing more important than the other. I mean you can\u2019t have Bitcoin probably without the Internet. But the Internet without Bitcoin is not much the way it\u2019s gone! So I don\u2019t know! But I love hearing you talk about things, I love the way you ask questions, I thought the way you cut into Schiff was gold! I\u2019m done with him now! I was done with him for a while, but I was like, Yep after John asked that question, there\u2019s no more! It\u2019s pointless until he\u2019s willing to acknowledge the question you\u2019re actually asking! And that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing all day long! So I\u2019m just enamored with you. We didn\u2019t get into a lot of things, but you live in Thailand, you\u2019re in Newfoundland now, you\u2019re from there, you can\u2019t get home. You\u2019re a wanderer but you\u2019re settling down. I think it\u2019s wild man, and I\u2019m so glad we connected. I really enjoyed our conversation and I just want to hear more from you! Clubhouse is a different animal, because it\u2019s more talk radio and it\u2019s more new to experts, and once in a while these experts get into expert conversations about different topics and I love the combination of people there. But at the end of the day it\u2019s not as fulfilling to me. It\u2019s kind of like Reality TV. I could jump in and just waste some time there. I go there to veg out actually. To listen to other people to be entertained. I don\u2019t go there to share my thoughts because I\u2019m just happy to hear everyone else\u2019s! And I was happy to hear you get the opportunity to ask Peter a real question in a live format that he couldn\u2019t sidestep without his own words and edit out. So that was dope. So I just want to hear you everywhere, I loved your article in Bitcoin Magazine, I liked your take on things, I\u2019m just so happy we got to connect.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: Yeah man again I really appreciate the kind words and I\u2019m stoked that we got to connect to! And I agree with the Clubhouse stuff. I drop in every now and then and oftentimes I just find myself being like, Man I\u2019ve heard this shit before, or it\u2019s the same person who loves to hear the sound of their own voice, and I love that there\u2019s a lot of orange-pilling going on there and I think it\u2019s an interesting platform, but this is what I live for! You get to dial in with a person or a group of people and you really get to take the conversation somewhere! Like I\u2019m doing one with Breedlove and Richard James next week and it\u2019s looking at Jordan Peterson\u2019s book Maps of Meaning and we\u2019re just going to explore that book and relate it to Bitcoin in various degrees, and that\u2019s the stuff that I really enjoy! Because like I said about my future, I\u2019d love it if that could be part of my day, these intellectual conversations where we kind of ask the big questions and try to foil around and fumble around with them! And try to use each other to help refine them for ourselves. I mean that\u2019s what gets me off. So the social media domain is fun and we like to have fun there and banter and other stuff, but I love this and man I couldn\u2019t tell you how much I appreciate, one, the work that you\u2019re doing \u2014 I love your work as well, and also for having me on for this chat, it\u2019s been awesome!"}

{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Yeah this is so dope. I hope I see you in Clubhouse. Again I just kind of see it as \u2014 I think it\u2019s here to stay! I think it\u2019s a wild format. Someone said in Clubhouse it\u2019s the pre-party and the after-party. Like I could see like, and I think they\u2019re gonna roll out features! You could do your podcast in there and they\u2019ll record it, and you could have a pre-party and an after-party and people spill out. But the opera is the opera, the show is the show. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll surpass that. But 100% man, this has been so dope to connect. I\u2019m just so happy we got to do this. And I really appreciate your time.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " John Vallis: Yeah me too brother, I appreciate it!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [05:30]: Sort of the purpose of humanity has been to channel energy through our intellect. It\u2019s how we\u2019ve developed everything, essentially! And I\u2019m reminded of a quote by Alfred North Whitehead that I\u2019ll paraphrase. He said that it\u2019s common wisdom for people to say you should think before you act, but that in fact civilization advances by us being able to execute more important operations without having to think about them! So we\u2019re actually \u2014 when we can embed these certain important actions in a protocol that we don\u2019t need to think about as much, it frees us up to do other things \u2014 that\u2019s kind of the layers upon which we\u2019ve built civilization. It just seems like this Digital Age we\u2019re going into is something radically new! It seems to be as profound as the Renaissance, or as profound as the Enlightenment! Do you see it that way? Are we co-evolving with the tools that we\u2019re creating and that the next 500 years are gonna be something so fundamentally different than what history has been that it will be difficult to recognize it in a few hundred years?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [06:48]: I do think that the creation of Bitcoin and the creation of the first effective crypto network is an elemental force that is a true invention akin to the discovery of fire or the discovery of atomic energy or the discovery of \u2014 we can make a list of a lot of fundamental things. Maybe one interesting thing is just the science of sterilization. Germs \u2014 modern medicine and the awareness and the importance of sterilizing instruments and the way that the disease spreads! Immunology. Once we figured that out, we were able to go from living 50 years to living 70 years because we realized that every time we entered into a medical procedure including the birth of a child, we were entering into a non-sterile environment that was life-threatening, soul-sucking, life-stealing. The death rate from childbirth was huge, right? The average life expectancy was short, and we needed that breakthrough to realize that we were swimming in germs, and the very simple solution is: Wash your hands! Sterilize your instruments! And you put that together with antibiotics and human life expectancy jumps by 50%! What if we\u2019re actually doing economics with dirty money? And so we\u2019ve been using monetary energy which is bleeding, right? It\u2019s the same way as operating with non-sterile instruments, and the patient keeps dying and we don\u2019t know why. The significance of Bitcoin is: We\u2019re going from defective money, which is somewhere between toxic \u2014 it may just been ineffective, bleeding 2, 3, 4% a year\u2014or it\u2019s toxic when it gets to -10% or -15% real yield. So using toxic money, how is that different than using toxic instruments when I commit surgery on you? How is it different than feeding you toxic food? I think we\u2019re breaking through this new world, we sterilize our instruments, we encrypt our money, we\u2019re moving to a science of non-toxic economic energy. Madame Curie died of radiation poisoning. She died of cancer from the radiation. They didn\u2019t realize that radiation killed you, that it caused cancer. There\u2019s a lot of basics in life that we don\u2019t understand. A big breakthrough in health was when we realized that sugar was toxic. My mother didn\u2019t know that sugar was toxic! Conventional wisdom and governmental advice was you need your four favorite food groups and pursue a low-fat diet but starch and sugar was fine. And of course now we know that too much starch and too much sugar makes you insulin-resistant, makes you Type-2 diabetic, gives you cancer. My mother became diabetic, became overweight, got cancer. We thought it was just unfortunate. The doctors said, We don\u2019t know why these things are happening, it\u2019s just unfortunate. If I could go back in time I\u2019d be like, I know exactly why it happens! I know exactly how to solve it now! Like, don\u2019t eat sugar, don\u2019t eat starch \u2014 stop eating! Fast! I never eat before 1 in the afternoon, I only eat in an 8-hour window and I\u2019ll go 2\u20133 days and I won\u2019t eat. I adopt fasting and I won\u2019t drink anything with sugar in it. You want to live a long time, don\u2019t dose yourself with sugar, it\u2019s toxic! The instruments are toxic. The germs are toxic. We killed George Washington \u2014 we bled him to death! Toxic. The money is toxic. That\u2019s fundamentally the issue. The money is toxic. I mean, that\u2019s the fundamental issue with inflation, and if we segue into the discussion of inflation, everybody keeps thinking there is no inflation because everybody focuses upon a market basket of consumer goods. And if you look in the US and you look in Europe, they leave food and energy out of the basket of consumer goods and they say, We left out the highly volatile food and energy from the index. Well highly volatile means it went up! [And if you put them in, 12:06] the number would change! Volatility in other words is the signal! We\u2019ve left out everything that actually changes in price from our price index. It literally is like a Jedi Mind Trick, and it\u2019s like a triple mind trick. It\u2019s like: We have a consumer price index and we\u2019ve left the prices that vary out of the index. We have a consumer price index \u2014 well first of all it\u2019s not a scalar, it\u2019s a vector. It\u2019s an indimensional vector dynamically changing in time \u2014 you\u2019ve just created a scalar. We\u2019ve created a market basket of things that we think you want. Yes, your basket is what I want! The market basket of things that you want does not include assets. No! I would never want to buy assets, only rich people buy assets! Poor people do not buy assets! How did poor people get rich? You have to buy assets to go from being poor to being rich. I didn\u2019t go from being poor to being wealthy by not buying assets or not creating assets \u2014 you create them or you buy them. So the entire field of inflation is defective, and the irony is that 99% of the economists that talk about it, they\u2019ve already accepted the notion that a market basket of consumer products and services is acceptable, and it\u2019s acceptable to throw out energy and good. And I\u2019ve never seen an economist say, Why don\u2019t we actually define the things that a working 22-year old is gonna want to buy by the time they\u2019re 32? And here\u2019s one thing: Early retirement! I want to buy early retirement by the time I\u2019m 32. How do I do that? I need to buy a bond that pays me $75,000 a year in interest risk-free, and I need for the $75,000 a year to pay my living expenses. And if the interest rate was 7% then I\u2019d need $1 Million for that. But if the interest rate goes to 0.7% I\u2019d need $10 Million for that. So from 2010 to 2020 the interest rate went down to 60 basis points on a 10-year government bond which meant that the bond went from $1 Million to $10 Million, which meant that the 22-year old was suffering from 22% inflation on early retirement! But because that\u2019s not in the basket \u2014because that\u2019s not something that you would ever want to give them \u2014 there\u2019s no inflation! You can actually track it and you can see that the inflation rate changes across a thousand different \u2014 if you just started with a simple principle: Inflation is a basket of products, services, or assets. If you just did that, that\u2019s kind of the equivalent of saying, Oh it\u2019s possible the Sun revolves around the Earth, it\u2019s possible the Earth revolves around the Sun \u2014 let\u2019s find out which! Has anybody ever asked the question whether or not the basket should include assets? Or products or services? No one\u2019s even questioning the most basic premise! It\u2019s pernicious rule of propaganda, and it\u2019s attributed to Joseph Goebbels in the Nazi regime who said \u2014 and it\u2019s also attributed to [Ogilvy 15:31], so maybe it\u2019s apocryphal \u2014 but he said, All of our focus groups show us and tell us we can\u2019t tell people what to think. But we can tell them what to think about! I cannot change your mind once you\u2019ve made it up\u2014and if you have an opinion \u2014 but I can get you to focus upon something. So if I just keep saying inflation, CPI, and it didn\u2019t go up and this is what it is\u2014When\u2019s the last time 100 Million people said, What we really wanted to buy was early retirement? I didn\u2019t even know that was a product I could buy! Because I couldn\u2019t conceive of it! Well it is a product you can buy: It\u2019s a government 30-year bond that yields 6% interest in a non-inflationary environment \u2014 that\u2019s a risk-free retirement. You can buy that! Right now, the problem is at 140 basis points that would cost you $30 Million for $60,000 a year. How do I make that at $75,000 a year salary saving $15,000? If I\u2019m making $500,000 a year and I save $100,000\u2014you know, I pay $200,000 in tax, I make $300,000, I save $100,000 \u2014 if I save $100,000 for 20 years I\u2019ve got $2 Million, and investing that in a government bond at 60 basis points or 100 basis points, you get nothing! [17:07] So the problem starts with the fact that inflation is misdefined. The right way to think about it is: Every single product, service, or asset has an inflation co-efficient. And the inflationary co-efficient, that\u2019s the rate at which the price will change as I pump fiat into the money system. And so the co-efficients vary, and they\u2019re a function of the scarcity of the asset, the demand of the asset, the information content of the asset, the material cost or the variable cost of the asset, and then the modularity of the asset. If I can stamp out the asset a million times out of a factory, it\u2019s gonna be less inflationary because the fixed cost is higher and the variable cost is lower. Mobile phones will not be inflationary because everything\u2019s in the fab. Software will not be inflationary because there\u2019s no variable cost. Streaming music on Amazon Music or Apple Music will not be inflationary because I can stream it a billion times. A Picasso will be inflationary because there\u2019s only 20, 50, 100. The best 5 acres of beachfront property in the middle of Miami Beach will be inflationary to the extent people want Miami Beach. 5 acres in Ohio will not be inflationary because there\u2019s a lot of land in the world. The only land people want is in the middle of New York, the middle of London, the Hamptons, Miami Beach, the middle of LA, the middle of San Francisco, the middle of Tokyo. You fly across this country and look down, there\u2019s enough land to park 10 Billion people on 5 acres each! It\u2019s just gotta be in demand and scarce."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [19:05]: May I ask you a question about this? So the co-efficient itself in my mind would be a product of the scarcity of the good or service relative to the scarcity of the money it\u2019s denominated in, such that if the money supply is outpacing the production of the good or service, that good or service would inflate in price, right? So to your point it\u2019s not a single variable \u2014 it\u2019s not CPI is inflation \u2014 everything has its own inflation rate. The second part of that question would be: Why is the narrative surrounding inflation so distorted? Do you think it\u2019s intentional by governments that are clearly heavily indebted? I don\u2019t see any equitable benefit to inflation whatsoever, it\u2019s purely a mechanism for reallocating wealth, and I don\u2019t understand why the narrative\u2019s so distorted!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [20:00]: 200 years ago people thought they had to bleed George Washington to death to save his life, and everybody agreed on it! The whole point of paradigm shifts is: Everybody agreed that the Sun revolved around the Earth. Everybody agreed the world was flat. Everybody agreed that humans would never fly. Everybody agrees on stuff until they realize that they\u2019re just utterly and totally and horrifically wrong! So in this particular case, I blow a bunch of liquidity into the system. Let\u2019s say there\u2019s $50 Trillion worth of energy and I blow $10 Trillion worth of money in the system. So there\u2019s still $50 Trillion worth of energy, but now the money is diluted by 20%, right? So if I have a product and I can measure the pure energy content of the product, then if it\u2019s 100% pure energy, the price has gotta go up by 20% if I expand the money supply by 20% assuming it\u2019s completely liquid and in demand. What\u2019s an example of that? Maybe a bond! A pure financial instrument, something that \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Yeah! You\u2019re throwing out anything that changes! So it\u2019s self-defeating.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [24:45]: So bottom line is: There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, but the inflation that\u2019s being reported is an irrelevant metric. I call it a metaphysical metric that\u2019s been artificially defined in order to provide some comfort. And it\u2019s working! The great majority of people, not only do they not think there\u2019s inflation, you literally have politicians lamenting that they can\u2019t create inflation and how important it is to create inflation, even as they\u2019re inflating every scarce asset on Earth to the point where no one can afford \u2014 look, Robert, like, I\u2019m a rich man! I\u2019m a very wealthy man! I can\u2019t afford to buy a house in the Hamptons! Like I\u2019ll go look at these things and I\u2019m like, Who\u2019s paying $47 Million? They\u2019re selling houses for $25 Million on 2 acres! I\u2019m like, Are you guys out of your minds? Or you go to New York City and someone\u2019s paying $25 Million for a 5,000 square foot apartment. $5,000 a square foot! At the end of the day, it\u2019s obscene. And what you can see is: We\u2019re running 10\u201320% inflation for the past decade, we\u2019re just running it on all of the scarce luxury assets that have high energy value. I mean, what\u2019s the definition of scarce, right? Maybe the definition of scarce is that it has high energy value, because if I could stamp out a billion-trillion of \u2019em for the same unit of energy I must be diluting the energy down, right?"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Right, right. Just take things that are hard to produce! So gold and Bitcoin are all inflating. And I would say that it is a lie, right? I\u2019m not sure necessarily about the intentionality, you could argue about that. But it\u2019s definitely a lie, that CPI is inflation. And it seems like it\u2019s being used to cover up this widespread system of theft that is monetary inflation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [27:08]: I\u2019m not even sure that they realize that it is theft or that they\u2019re doing it! I\u2019m half-convinced that 80% of the people in government don\u2019t even realize that the inflation metric is a wrong metric and irrelevant! It\u2019s like I\u2019m burning myself to death and I\u2019m calculating the temperature on the counter 6 feet away and I\u2019m burning but I need to keep turning the thermostat down. And I guess it\u2019s like they\u2019re just not feeling the pain. And because of that it takes us to the issue of interest, right? If you think inflation is not coming so you keep printing money and you keep driving the interest rate down, the problem we have is really just a war on currency, a war on time, we render the money toxic if you hold the money. Once you understand that the real inflation rate is 10\u201315% because that\u2019s how the assets were [clocking 28:10], then you realize that any currency you\u2019re holding is draining energy from your life at 10% a year. It\u2019s almost like I put in a battery that drains 1\u20132% a month. I can\u2019t store energy! You know another metaphor for what happens in the human body when you can\u2019t store energy? It\u2019s like, Robert if I took you and I dropped you in the middle of the Arctic Circle and it was 20 below, your body would start losing energy at a rapid rate, you\u2019d freeze to death. It\u2019s literally like I come into your office and I crank the temperature down 20 degrees and I\u2019m freezing you to death because I\u2019m pulling the energy off your skin. And so what do you do? Insulate, cover up, right? But what if you can\u2019t? If you\u2019re a wealthy person you put on a fur coat, right? Or maybe you\u2019re smart enough to realize: What do wealthy people do? You drop them in the Arctic and they get on their jet and they fly to the Caribbean where it\u2019s warm because they can! And what do you do if you\u2019re poor? I drop you in the Arctic, or even worse I go to your hometown and I just turn the temperature down to 20 below and you can\u2019t leave! But you know it\u2019s like I slowly freeze you to death. I don\u2019t do it fast. You don\u2019t even realize it\u2019s happening if it happened at a gradual enough rate. It\u2019s like, I know I\u2019m working hard I\u2019m just not getting ahead. I\u2019m working hard but I\u2019m not getting ahead, because every time I put money in the bank the price of everything keeps going up. The price of a house in Miami Beach it was $1 Million on the street where I live, and then it\u2019s 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, $10 Million. I\u2019m not talking about every decade, I\u2019m talking about every year! I\u2019m talking 2000\u20132010 during that administration we were printing money so fast that we had this housing boom and everybody that owned houses were happy \u2014 they\u2019re refinancing their houses \u2014 but you look at it and you\u2019re like, How is it possible that people bought this house in 1998 for $1 Million and I\u2019m being asked to pay $10 Million for the same house? If you happen to be working for cash \u2014 it\u2019s what Pomp would say \u2014 if you\u2019re working for cash and paying taxes and then you\u2019re putting the cash in the bank, then you\u2019re suffering from inflation \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Let me ask you: Just to jump back a little bit to Bitcoin as a unit of account or a financial frame of reference. Do you suggest here that it is actually useful\u2014I guess you could do this with either Bitcoin or gold \u2014 to look at the historic price charts denominated in Bitcoin or gold to strip out a lot of this central bank induced market manipulation via inflation?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: I think that that will be a lot more useful in the next 10 years with Bitcoin. The first 10 years with Bitcoin, it was so developmental going from zero. You have this asymptotic zero number, so I think that if you look over the next 10 years that\u2019ll become a valuable thing. People have done it in gold and I think it\u2019s a more stable application because gold is a bit more stable through this time period. But again it\u2019s manipulated to a certain extent and its got its own problems."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: This would help eliminate some confusion I think for people that think the S&P is just going up forever. If you actually denominate it in gold the chart doesn\u2019t look that great, right? It had a boom in 2001 but it\u2019s not been good ever since.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [34:32]: If you simply divide it by the monetary supply, if the monetary supply is going up by 7% and the S&P is going up by 8%, then the overall market\u2019s flat. And that makes sense because why do people think that stocks should always go up 8%? I\u2019m in business, Robert, it\u2019s hideously competitive! Do you think that we don\u2019t have a competitive market for everything in this country? It\u2019s obscenely competitive! And so what you\u2019ve got if you look at the NASDAQ is you have like 5 companies \u2014 Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft \u2014 those 5. And aren\u2019t they responsible for like 80% of the game? Everybody else is competing and it\u2019s a competitive market! And what does that mean? It means it\u2019s hard to grow 20% a year because whenever you do anything someone else is copying you and they\u2019re pushing on you. So unless you get a dominant digital network with a near-monopoly with these massive, exploding economies of scale on a zero variable cost, low variable cost, it\u2019s very very difficult to perform. And most of the S&P isn\u2019t! To the extent that the S&P isn\u2019t Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, they\u2019re just a bunch of companies competing with each other, so you would think that they would grow at the productivity growth rate of the overall company which is 2\u20133%. If you had hard money \u2014 by the way, coming back to that theory of Bitcoin network value \u2014 Bitcoin network value goes through the roof, skyrockets in the early days when there\u2019s massive adoption and massive technology explosion, but in the later stages of the S-curve when it\u2019s fully diffused and when it\u2019s mature, it just grows with the GDP. It grows with the productivity of the people in the network. If they grow 2% a year, it grows 2% a year! So in a mature equity market you would expect equity indexes, equity prices to grow with the GDP. If they\u2019re growing faster, it\u2019s the monetary expansion, right? Expand the monetary supply 7%, expand the GDP 1%, S&P should go up 8%! It\u2019s gonna be disproportionate. The big tech, the leading-edge, innovative tech, is gonna be double, triple, quadruple that, and then the trailing-edge laggards are gonna be tanking, and then everyone that\u2019s working their asses off as hard as they can is gonna be barely keeping up! Because you have to do 100,000 things right just to stay in business in a real Darwinian capitalist economy. It\u2019s like: Being flat means defeating 99% of the rest of the market \u2014 being flat. To be up, you have to, you know \u2014 Amazon\u2019s up because they beat 15,000 companies! The next two are just slightly okay, and there\u2019s some that are flat, and everybody else is destroyed because of the natural effect there."}

There are 3,500 publicly traded companies. [To be the best you have to better than 38:36] 99.99% of humanity. That makes you the number 1 out of 10,000 people. If you were smarter than 99.99% of humanity, there are 750,000 people on the planet smarter than you! And 99% of them want what you have, if you have a billion dollars. If you have a publicly traded company, 99% of the people that are smarter than 10,000 other people don\u2019t have what you have, and they can probably raise $1 Billion and chase you, right? They\u2019re harder, they\u2019re smarter, they\u2019re faster, they\u2019re stronger than you are! Like I\u2019m sitting at a company \u2014 one of 3,500 \u2014 and the world is full of people that are smarter than me that can raise $1 Billion that want what we have, want what I have. That\u2019s Darwinian competition! There\u2019s the view from one side of the table which is, Oh yeah well you made it, you\u2019re successful. There\u2019s the deal on the other side of the table, which is: There\u2019s a guy that\u2019s gonna work 80 hours a week that\u2019s gonna be surrounded with 100 other people that are gonna work 70 hours a week that are gonna raise infinite money that are going to target you and do everything they can to take their market from you. Now that\u2019s a very humbling observation, that\u2019s why you can\u2019t rest on your laurels. There\u2019s something beautiful in that terrifying concept! That\u2019s what drives humanity forward!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: It keeps you honest, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: It is the core of Stoicism and it reminds you, your best chance is to focus all of your energy, all of your assets on just this one thing that you\u2019re gonna be the best in the world at, and you better stay humble! If I take my own business \u2014 I became public in 1998 \u2014 there\u2019s a 99% mortality rate. 99 out of the 100 companies I competed with are gone. Out of my peers, I\u2019m the only person \u2014 I\u2019m talking about 100 publicly traded companies \u2014 there\u2019s probably 500 CEOs that launched a company with 20, 30, 50, $100 Million of capital, and they\u2019re all gone! That\u2019s what the open market, the free market, will do. And it is what it is. I mean that\u2019s why the human race is what they are. There\u2019s always someone. And when they attack, if you\u2019re distracted, if you\u2019re arrogant, if you\u2019re fat, dumb, happy, comfortable, they\u2019re going to eat you! And if you\u2019re half-focused or de-focused, they\u2019re gonna take your arm off! And if you\u2019re completely focused, you can react. If there\u2019s something they\u2019re doing that\u2019s good, you channel it, you inherit it, you evolve, you live and you grow stronger. And otherwise you shrink and they squeeze you out of the entire market. There\u2019s something I observed and again it\u2019s very Stoic, it\u2019s: Everybody thinks when you\u2019re young you wanna acquire as much as you can acquire. So young men are acquisitive. Young business people are acquisitive. Can you acquire the thing? That\u2019s generally the easiest hurdle to jump. The next question is: Can you maintain the thing? Can you stay competitive? That\u2019s 10 times harder! And the biggest hurdle is: Are you going to be able to commercialize the thing or profit from it? Can you buy something or build something and continuously improve it forever so that you\u2019re competitive and then do it in a manner that is cheaper such that you can charge more for it than it costs you to do that thing. That\u2019s obscenely hard! So typically everybody think that they can acquire something, then when they realize the maintenance requirements they fail, and then very people ever get to the point where they could commercialize something. By the way you can apply it to a boat: Everybody wants to buy a boat, and then they\u2019re like, Oh my God! This is really expensive to maintain a boat and I can\u2019t afford to maintain the boat. But if they buy the boat, they gotta spend 10% a year to maintain it. And then at some point the question is, Can you enjoy the boat? They\u2019re like, Oh! I\u2019m spending all this money on the boat but I never have time to go and use the boat \u2014 this is just crazy! This is weighing around my neck! I gotta get rid of this! It\u2019s an example of being too ambitious in your acquisitiveness, and it illustrates the law of decimation. And the law of decimation is: In the ancient Roman republic if the legion screwed up, they killed 1 out of every 10 men in the legion. Actually the made the 9 kill the 10th in order to remind them that they should stay disciplined."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Do you think this \u2014 we\u2019ll call it a law of nature, this 10% of the components in a complex system break down yearly, annually, and require maintenance \u2014 is this connected to the religious tithing, do you think? Where you\u2019re actually supposed to feed the flame with 10% of your profit to maintain the institution?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [47:46]: I think it\u2019s interesting the extent to which you see this 10% number pop up on an annual basis. 10% is the maintenance obligation on a boat. 10% is the tithing obligation for thousands of years. 10% is a reasonable estimate for a house with 187 light bulbs, 18 of \u2019em will burn out, right? It just pops up over and over again! And my only real explanation is just: friction, randomness, chaos, life, corrosion, weather, termites, bugs, bacteria. The same would be true with your body, right? If you\u2019re talking about maintaining yourself. You\u2019ve got to actually allocate time and energy to maintain yourself and a lot of times people under-invest in their own health. And then when they under-invest in those things they blame it on genetics or they blame it on some unfortunate occurrence. We don\u2019t know why these this happened it\u2019s very unfortunately \u2014 these things just happen sometimes. I\u2019ll end with one thought on Stoicism. And Nicholas Taleb would appreciate this one too. It\u2019s like, The words don\u2019t matter \u2014 the action matters. Okay? Words are just words. And that applies to Stoics: you and me and Marcus Aurelius. I think one of the great paradoxes of history is Marcus Aurelius was the last emperor in the line of the Antonines during the golden age of Rome and there was Trajan, and there was Hadrian, Marcus Antoninus, etc., and for about 100 years that was the Pax Romana, and each of those emperors was elected based on virtue as an adult and he adopted his heir, and they typically adopted a 40-year old emperor who had had a career in the military of virtue and he was tough and responsible and grounded in reality. And if you\u2019re a general in the army campaigning and you get drunk and screw around your soldiers put a knife in you! You\u2019re not gonna make it! In order to keep the respect and stay alive in war-time around a bunch of guys with weapons, you better be a good leader and they better respect you because you\u2019re leading them to their death, if they don\u2019t respect you! So if you actually rose through that meritocracy, maybe you had a chance. So Marcus Aurelius writes the Meditations and it\u2019s the quintessential text on Stoicism. And he says, Just because you can do a thing doesn\u2019t mean you should do a thing. He said, Soon you will have forgotten all and all will have forgotten you, and you should know your place in the universe, and you should submit yourself and do the right thing for everyone else, and that\u2019s all good! But at the end of the day, the single most important decision Marcus Aurelius made in his entire career, in his life, was the decision on an heir, and when it came time to make that decision he failed miserably and he appointed his son Commodus to be the emperor. And Commodus was a minor and of weak moral and intellectual constitution and in no way shape or form qualified to be emperor of all the known world. And by so doing that Marcus Aurelius plunged the Roman Empire into chaos and turmoil for hundreds of years, resulting in the deaths of millions if not tens or hundreds of millions of people \u2014 awful! Awful! And there\u2019s your philosopher-king! He\u2019s remembered today as somebody that\u2019s written a good book and had been a great Stoic. But if you look at his actions, the actual action he took was the least Stoic, most foolish, most painful action of any of his forbears and it just makes the blood curdle!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [52:21]: Yeah! I\u2019ve been anxiously waiting to talk about this actually because I\u2019m a huge fan of Marcus Aurelius. That particular episode is documented somewhat well in the movie Gladiator for people that want to go out and watch it. But he is also known to have been one of the greatest emperors of all time, right? Up until that point where he made that fateful decision.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: He was great until the succession. He had all of the power of the Western World in his hands. He had the keys, right? The crypto keys to all the wealth and power in the Roman Empire!

{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [53:14]: And he was that Platonic ideal of the philosopher king! Arguably the only successful philosopher king throughout history. And I think one of his other quotes that I really liked is, No man can lose any other life than he now lives, nor can he live any other life than he now loses. Stoicism\u2019s been big in my life personally and I think it\u2019s necessary for everything we\u2019ve talked about today, for this eternal contention we have with reality. If you don\u2019t adopt a Stoic philosophy, how do you keep yourself together?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [53:55]: I think Stoicism is critical, and I think he was a good writer. I would even probably admit he was a good emperor until that final decision, which I just lay out as a paradox.

You still have time to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory."}

You can read up on it and come to your own conclusions. It\u2019s a short chapter. Our last point just on vitality: A synonym for antifragility could be genetic vitality, Darwinian vitality.

{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: And this was Darwin\u2019s famous quote, It\u2019s not the strongest, fastest, or smartest species that survives, but the one that\u2019s most adaptive to change.

Yeah, there\u2019s a certain terrifying beauty in nature. There are no ugly animals. You look at a bird that is beautiful. You look at a lion in the wild, it\u2019s beautiful. No one\u2019s got a mangy coat, there\u2019s no unhealthy anything, and that\u2019s our ideal of beauty, right? We think nature is beautiful, all the trees are beautiful, the plants are beautiful, the birds are beautiful, they chirp their beautiful sounds, the flowers are beautiful. What they don\u2019t really think about is what\u2019s going on behind the scenes, because they\u2019ve got this simple zoo backyard view of nature. The truth is, everything\u2019s at its finest when tomorrow is uncertain. When the life of the creature is uncertain. I\u2019ve actually got this beautiful banyan vine trees in the back of my house in Florida. One day on a beautiful sunny day I walked by and I stood and stared at the tree and I saw a bunch of ants running up and down. And when I traced the ants I saw that there were thousands of ants and I saw that there was a centipede. Some kind of millipede about a hundred times bigger than a normal ant. And those ants had decided that they\u2019re going to eat that. They were actually gonna haul that millipede back to their queen as dinner. And they attacked it relentlessly, relentlessly. And I watched hundreds and hundreds and then thousands and then thousands of ants going into this one millipede. And it\u2019s fighting for its life and I swear I watched for 45 minutes like a war non-stop on a beautiful sunny day. If you looked around you would\u2019ve saw grass and blue sky and pretty water and birds chirping, but there was knock-down, drag-out war to devour this millipede and it\u2019s fighting for its life. And I watched it crawl up the tree and the ants dragged it down and it did everything it could and they kept coming and it just had this horrific, terrifying, sad conclusion. It\u2019s gonna die. Unless a massive rainstorm spins up to blow water down and create some disruption it\u2019s got no chance. It\u2019s going to get eaten alive. And it\u2019s horrific and it\u2019s terrifying, and that\u2019s life! That\u2019s nature! And then you start to realize, on all those pretty National Geographic TV shows, you see the lions attack the antelope or the gazelle and they try and this miss like, Well, no dinner for you tonight! No, the antelope trot off happy with their babies and the lions trot off happy with a little smirk. And everybody\u2019s like, That\u2019s about as much nature as they want! Nobody wants any more nature! When you think about it a bit more you realize, Well they\u2019re gonna miss 3\u20134 days, they\u2019re gonna hit 1 of those a week, and the 99% of them are gonna live but 1 of them is gonna die, and over 3 years they\u2019re all gonna die. And over 3 years they were all gonna be eaten by the lions. And that\u2019s nature! Every week that goes by, it\u2019s like they\u2019re clicking on a carousel. And the oldest one is getting slower, and a little bit more tired, and a little bit less flexible, and if they don\u2019t get the old one, they\u2019re gonna get the unlucky one. And that\u2019s why every one of them is beautiful! Because they\u2019re all in the prime of their life! And the same is true with all the predators: they\u2019re all in the prime of their life. When they get a little bit old, a little bit hurt, they get driven out of the tribe or out of the pride and that\u2019s the end of it. So in nature the life expectancy of those wolves or those predators or those lions is 5 years, and in the zoo it\u2019s 15 years. Now if you want to see a fat, mangy, lame one, you\u2019ll find one in the zoo. You won\u2019t find one in the wild. And the same is true with the rest. And when those two herds, when they go at each other like that viciously, they\u2019re both strengthening. You take away the wolves from the deer, the deer overpopulate, they eat all of the trees, the trees all die, the trees die, they destabilize the embankment of the river, the river erodes, the riverbank gets screwed up, all the greenery dies, all the deer are gone, all the wolves are gone. You wanna fix the river? You put the wolves back in. The wolves scare away the deer, the trees grow, the roots stabilize the bank, the river flows, all the wildlife returns. This beautiful thing we call nature is in continual dynamic equilibrium, and everything about it is getting stronger and harder and faster and getting culled all the time. And mother nature is supreme, and men with delusions that they will defeat her are gonna be disappointed, right? I guess the great challenge is this paradox: the paradox is the paradox of the engineer versus the zookeeper. We see nature, we want to engineer a better world for ourselves, and it can be done. But we can also reach too far and try too hard and try to make water flow uphill and try to make time flow backwards. We can try to shake our fist at mother nature, we can defeat all of those natural forces, and if we try to do that, the energy consumption goes up exponentially. And eventually it goes up to such a level that we deplete ourselves of energy, and we end up like those natives on Easter Island where you chop down every tree to build your monuments to your gods and pretty soon there\u2019s no canoes and pretty soon there\u2019s no fish and pretty soon there\u2019s no food and pretty soon there\u2019s no you! All you\u2019ve got is your monuments to your god and you\u2019re all dead because you depleted the energy in the ecosystem in pursuit of over-engineering your reality."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [1:02:11]: Let me ask you about that point, which I think is fantastic: it seems to me like the free market is the economic expression of that Darwinian equilibrium, and that possibly with the implementation of central banking, which is antithetical to a free market institution, that is it\u2019s a monopoly. I guess in our attempt to over-engineer the economy we have disturbed that Darwinian equilibrium in the economy and that\u2019s why we have all these haywire consequences like inflation and negative rates and so on and so forth?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: Yeah we\u2019ve stopped it, right? We\u2019ve attempted to stop time and interfere with nature. We\u2019re trying to freeze that dynamic equilibrium that\u2019s being continually calculated all the time. We\u2019re trying to turn nature into a zoo."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [05:49]: I\u2019m gonna bring up one more point on the religious aspect of Bitcoin that I\u2019ve thought about. My religious tradition too was Southern Baptist \u2014 I was raised Southern Baptist \u2014 so I have Judeo-Christian underpinning in my thought. But the ancient idea in Genesis was that God was the force that confronts chaos with courage, truth, love, and converts that chaos into good, inhabitable order. So when we look at that through a thermodynamic lens, we know that the whole universe is everywhere and always trending towards increasing chaos and entropy, and that the only thing that works against that thermodynamic arrow of time is life, actually! Life converts entropy into order. So in a way we could say that life or even the God-aspect of life is the anti-entropic principle that propagates through all of life. And I can\u2019t help but relate that and see Bitcoin in that lens, too, where we do have this system that\u2019s actually reaching deeper into chaos than anything else. The SHA-256 mining algorithm is quite literally finding a single atom in an entire universe \u2014 that is the mining race, if you will, is identifying the single atom in the universe \u2014 and with that reach into chaos it is forging the most profound order we\u2019ve ever had! You can\u2019t argue with the Bitcoin blockchain. Whoever has those UTXOs has them! So it seems to me like there is a profound connection between truth and this principle of converting chaos into order, and the quote that took that home for me with G. K. Chesterton was, A dead thing can go with the stream, only a living thing can swim against it. So Bitcoin in that sense is quite literally alive!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [08:06]: Bitcoin and beavers! The beaver is engineering the stream to create a dam, human beings are engineering systems. Bitcoin is an engineered monetary energy system. It\u2019s the first well-engineered monetary system that we\u2019ve built. Human beings through their intellect channel that energy, and within the [Bitcoin] system we extract order and we have a very efficient structure, and the price we pay is some disorder outside of our system. Some energy dissipation. But I\u2019m not terribly concerned with that. The universe has got more energy than it needs and we\u2019re just dipping our fingers into 0.000 \u2014 with a million kazillion 0\u2019s after it \u2014 0001%, right? So it can spare a little bit of energy! And when we create something beautiful \u2014 be it a railroad or Bitcoin network or social network or the like \u2014 we find a way to do something millions of times faster, smarter, stronger than before, and that drives forward the human race. So this is not the only great achievement of the human race, it just happens to be the most interesting achievement of the human race!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [09:39]: Would you say that\u2019s the struggle then? We\u2019re sort of pushing back entropy? That\u2019s what civilization is, right?

And you could also say humans are divine when they engineer \u2014 through their intellect \u2014 a better habitat for themself and those that they love. The human that bridges the chasm. The human that constructs the city. The human that creates the machine. And that\u2019s been going on for human history! That\u2019s the most honorable and admirable thing that human beings can do. And if we didn\u2019t do it, we\u2019d be running around naked on the plains being chased by wolves and probably eaten by wolves. And that\u2019s that. So to engineer is divine. Look at a problem, engineer a solution. That\u2019s why we respect the engineers. You wanna talk about Bitcoin as a medium of exchange?"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [26:56]: Yeah I think that\u2019s a great point. And this gets back to the difference between a free market and a monopoly. In a free market, you know that your customers have options. They can go to other providers, they could settle elsewhere, they could move their capital out. And because they have that optionality, you as the producer or provider are accountable to their preferences. You have to listen to the customer. You have to listen to their wishes and desires and make sure you\u2019re satisfying their wants. Whereas on the other end of that spectrum is the monopolist that, to your point, he just doesn\u2019t care about the preferences of his customer because his customers have no choice! They\u2019re stuck in his little fiefdom. I mean it\u2019s the difference between an economic democracy and an economic dictatorship.

Not a very profitable pursuit of human ingenuity! You know, you ask Meyer Lansky, What\u2019d you learn in all your years as a gangster? He said, It was so hard I realized if I\u2019d have to do it again I just would\u2019ve gone straight! It\u2019s a lot easier to make money just being legitimate, so inventing some kind of technology to evade the regulators explicitly? It\u2019s like, they might let you invent something that will carry energy 100 years forward, because it seems like something that legitimate law-abiding citizens might want to do. They\u2019re not gonna let you invent something that allows you to evade taxes, and so: Why try so hard? It\u2019s just not worth the trouble! I\u2019m reminded of the stories of Pablo Escobar, and he made the billions of dollars selling all the drugs and cocaine and they said at the end of his life he\u2019s sitting on the run and they\u2019re burning $100 bills in order to stay warm!

Bitcoin as a unit of measure: I think Bitcoin is the universal language of economic truth. I think it will evolve as a unit of monetary energy. It makes sense in that way. Before Bitcoin, if you go back 50 years, people talked about ounces of gold. So I think a Bitcoin will be like an ounce of gold \u2014 an immutable, self-sovereign unit of economic energy \u2014 it makes sense to think of it like that! On the other hand, it will generally always be converted into local fiat in the political domicile in question for buying and selling things. And that\u2019s okay. There will be countries that allow stronger, better currencies. There will be countries that\u2019ll have weaker currencies and they\u2019ll crash their currencies and they\u2019ll replace their currencies. And as long as you HODL Bitcoin in your account you\u2019ll be able to go into a new country. You know, I\u2019ve been to a country after they crashed their currency. We\u2019ve all been to Germany, they crashed their currency, we bought the new currency. Then they got rid of the Mark and it was the Euro, we bought the Euro! So the right way to think of it is as just a standard unit of economic energy or monetary energy and not overthink it, anything more than that. It can be interesting to say divide stock price by gold ounces \u2014 you can divide the cost of living by ounces of gold or by Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s interesting! It\u2019s okay. It\u2019ll give you a pretty good read on inflation. If 1 Bitcoin buys you a car in the US but 1 Bitcoin buys you a skyscraper somewhere else then you\u2019ll have relative cost of living. People did that with the Dollar, right? They used to say you could live in Mexico on the beach for $187 a month and live like a king. There are relative strengths. I think Bitcoin will be like that! But I don\u2019t think we need to stretch it any further than that. I think that\u2019s enough! I think ultimately, people focus too hard on medium of exchange, unit of measure, and they underestimate the value of Bitcoin as a store of value and as an asset. I think they undersell it and they don\u2019t do it justice! Because it\u2019s so much better than every other asset! And then I think the entire community of crypto, it\u2019s too much engaged in debates between the various crypto networks, with each other. Because I\u2019ll post something \u2014 Bitcoin is a great way to transmit energy into the future \u2014 and then the Ripple people will start fighting, and the Bitcoin Cash people, someone gets triggered and takes offense. The way I see it is: Crypto is a $300 Billion pond sitting on the beach next to a $300 Trillion ocean of capital, of energy. That\u2019s 99.9% of all energy of humanity, is sitting in alt-assets, not altcoins! Not cryptocurrency! So I see all the crypto enthusiasts working on all the altcoins and they\u2019re just trying to drag down Bitcoin. It reminds me of a bunch of crabs in a bucket and the bucket\u2019s kind of hot or overheating and the one crab wants to crawl out and the other crabs just want to drag it back in instead of crawling on its back and getting out! It\u2019s like, all the crabs just keep pulling each other back into the bucket. It\u2019s totally self-sabotaging and it doesn\u2019t matter, because what they ought to be thinking is, How do we get $30 Trillion of the $300 Trillion to flow into our pond? In fact, they ought to be thinking, We want to go from $300 Billion to $3 Trillion, and from $3 Trillion to $30 Trillion, and from $30 Trillion to $300 Trillion. And the way you\u2019re gonna get there is not by attacking each other. The way you\u2019re gonna get there is by dividing the market and focusing! So if you want to be a cryptocurrency, well currency means you have to have a stable asset value because the IRS is gonna tax you to death if it changes. So Tether can be a currency, and it cannot change! Do we need one? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a centralized stablecoin, and maybe we need a decentralized stablecoin. The market will decide that. But that\u2019s a thing in its own. And if you want to build a crypto application, there are applications of things that people might want that Bitcoin doesn\u2019t do like: total privacy, or maybe you want to issue title or provenance, or maybe you want to do a decentralized exchange or wrap something or implement insurance or lending. That\u2019s fine \u2014 DeFi. There are applications \u2014 have at it! You\u2019d be better off to, say, Ethereum is 60% of the application market, Tether is 52% of the currency market \u2014 cryptocurrency and crypto app \u2014 and then Bitcoin is 95% of the crypto asset market. And if you believe in another type of asset, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s impossible to ever come up with one, I just think that right now the only clearly successful crypto asset is Bitcoin."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Absolutely! And to people that don\u2019t understand this space, I like to articulate it that Bitcoin is digital gold. It has essentially already run and won that race. And that for the same economic and game-theoretic reasons there\u2019s only one analog of gold, there\u2019s only ever likely to be one digital gold. So it\u2019s almost like you just have to accept that. And then I describe the rest of the crypto-asset universe as liquid venture capital subjected to little, if any, due diligence! Some of them may succeed meaningful in markets orthogonal to money, but it\u2019s very high risk. And the fact that anyone can spin up one of these assets in 15 minutes on the Ethereum blockchain, there\u2019s a very low barrier to entry, very low diligence, so invest accordingly! I\u2019d suggest no one \u2014 if you\u2019re gonna have a crypto-asset portion of your portfolio, I think the highest risk position you could ever be in is 80:20 Bitcoin to everything else. And the conservative position would be 100% Bitcoin, 0% everything else.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [39:52]: I would agree with you. I think we see it the same way. And I guess it\u2019s a good segue just to general crypto theory: the emergence of magic in cyberspace. What\u2019s a crypto network, what\u2019s a digital network? How do I view it? And you tell me if I\u2019m right or wrong. I\u2019m a newcomer \u2014 you\u2019ve been around for a while. My view of crypto network is: A crypto network is a software application running on a decentralized network with a consensus mechanism, ideally proof of work, arguably maybe proof of stake or some other consensus mechanism that theorists would agree promotes decentralization and antifragility. And a digital network is a centralized network. It\u2019s a Facebook or Twitter or Google or Apple or whatever\u2014a more conventional client-server network. So as we look in the future of cyberspace we\u2019re gonna see crypto networks and digital networks. Why would you want a crypto network? You want a crypto network for immortal sovereignty and antifragility. We know Bitcoin is doing that right now. If you want to convey humanity across time and space \u2014 especially across time \u2014 maybe across time and domain, domain might be even better than space. You know, crypto networks aren\u2019t necessarily faster than digital networks for moving shit through space, but they\u2019re better at moving it across domains, and the reason for that is that sometimes you have lowest common denominator regulatory or compliance constraints that cripple the innovation in a digital network. Apple Computer will never do certain things because they\u2019re subject to the US law, even though they could do them in 98 countries! And so a crypto network may in fact develop faster across regulatory domains if digital networks are crippled. There\u2019s obviously trade-offs between digital and crypto, and I think about it as like: Trust, Security, and Duration are attributes of crypto. Economy, Performance, Functionality, and Compliance are attributes of digital. If I want to do it cheap, it\u2019s a billion times cheaper on a digital network. [42:37] If I want performance, it\u2019s a million times faster on a digital network. If I want functionality, it\u2019s likely much more functional. There\u2019s nobody that would dispute that Apple Pay or Apple or Google, they\u2019re beautiful, functional products. Apple or Google Maps. Trying to do Google Maps on a decentralized crypto network would probably be a disaster! And then compliance \u2014 digital networks are better at compliance. Sometimes we regret their compliance. They shut down stuff and they censor things. But they\u2019re better at compliance. So the very things that make crypto attractive \u2014 Trust, Security, Duration \u2014 are purchased at the price of giving up Economy, Performance, Functionality and Compliance. The conclusion is: Some stuff makes better sense to be doing digitally, and other stuff maybe with crypto. It\u2019s early days, and the only obvious conclusion we both agree on is Bitcoin is a successful crypto network as a store of value. We know that. Everything else is an experiment and when it hits $100 Billion it\u2019s not an experiment anymore. And we can debate whether it\u2019s an experiment at $50 Billion, but I would say at $100 Billion it\u2019s a thing, and it\u2019s pretty clear. And it might be a thing we all know and recognize below that, but you\u2019d need a lot more education to determine that."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [44:18]: I think \u2014 just to throw in my 2 cents here \u2014 it is distinguishing between a decentralized network and centralized. And this reminds me of an old quote, If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together. So the centralized solution is kind of like going alone, because it\u2019s just according to one single plan, it can innovate very quickly and move in a certain direction very quickly. Decision-making is concentrated. Whereas the decentralized solution has more of a dynamic equilibrium that lets it persist further across time. So the centralized solution is going to be really compliant, really fast, really innovative, but the decentralized solution is really only useful when you need censorship resistance. You need to know that it will persist across the maximum duration of time, and that no individual group or individual for that matter can shut it down or manipulate it. So Bitcoin is at the extreme end of that decentralized end of the spectrum, whereas something like Apple would be at the other end.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [45:27]: Yeah you could use a metaphor like an Aspen forest or some massive biomass versus an animal. A vertebrate versus invertebrates. Different life \u2014 plants versus animals. They\u2019re different creatures. And they have different life spans! You want to live for 2,000 years? Or do you want to live for 80 years? One of them moves faster than the other, but one of them is more vulnerable than the other. I think from a human point of view, the real question for humans is: Do you want to put your trust in Man, trust in the organization, trust in a company, trust in a government? And/or: Do you want to put your trust in a crypto network? And we\u2019re gonna solve our problems with a segmentation, mixture of these trusts. We\u2019re probably not gonna put the functionality into Bitcoin\u2014in a total decentralized proof of work network \u2014 that will do what Amazon does or Uber does or Pandora or YouTube does. Probably not! But do we really need to? We probably don\u2019t need to. So when we think about the crypto industry segmentation, I think you really want to divide and conquer. A crypto network is a life form. And I think that\u2019s different. I mean there\u2019s a genetic encoding in a crypto network, and it\u2019s very different than solving the problem with a human being or solving the problem even with a digital network. When you design the protocol, Bitcoin, and you let it go, it becomes a life form and it multiplies and all these nodes spread and all these miners spread. And you can\u2019t easily pull the genie back in the bottle and re-engineer the genetics of it when you\u2019ve released it into the wild. In fact, you would almost say that once plankton is spread out to dominate all the ecosystem \u2014 if God had a better idea \u2014 he created that and made those minnows! Or he created bacteria \u2014 he created a new species. You have a better idea? Create something different, and if that something different is in the same energy ecosystem as the plankton it\u2019s not gonna make it! [48:01] If you take a bird, the bird can coexist with a deer, but it\u2019s hard to create two apex predator birds and put them in the same space at the same time\u2014one of them eats the other one! One apex predator creature. And that\u2019s the same thing with crypto, I think. You gotta think of it as an evolution of a new life force in cyberspace, and the genetic code is of paramount importance! So if you really hope to be successful \u2014 and this is my opinion \u2014 when you release the privacy coin, you need to say, This is for this thing, and this is what it is, and we\u2019re going to get it just right and we\u2019re gonna let it breathe and let it live and we\u2019re not gonna mess with it or monkey with it. And we\u2019re not gonna decide that we wanted the monkey to have wings and also have gills and swim. And if I\u2019m watching TV and I see these cool antler things and I want to put the antlers on it! You can\u2019t be a technology-tinkering enthusiast with a crypto. You have to have more of the mindset of, It\u2019s the crazy guy in the lab coat in the laboratory creating a new kind of life, virus, creature. It\u2019s like you get one shot, and it\u2019s at a lab \u2014 and you\u2019re done! You can\u2019t get it back! And so you should be aware of just how important it is. It\u2019s a protocol. Life is a strand of DNA and that DNA is going to go and it\u2019s going to do whatever it\u2019s going to do. You\u2019re creating life. And so how devastating is it for God to say, I created human beings. I made a mistake. I\u2019m gonna recall them and then tinker and then do a human being 2.0. It\u2019s a problem, right? [50:04] In the Bible, the biblical analogy is the flood where everybody just gets killed. Or some crazy stuff in the Garden of Eden. But with things like Ethereum, right? You\u2019ve got Ethereum 1.0 and now you try to do Ethereum 2.0 \u2014 you\u2019d almost be better off just to do something different as opposed to like retrofit something, because it\u2019s going back and trying to force-fit the DNA. You could do it with a digital network. It\u2019s okay if you\u2019re running on a single server and you can throw a switch and everybody switches with it. But the whole point of a decentralized life form is that they\u2019re all different and they all get to make their own decisions! And if you can order them to do something, it doesn\u2019t feel that decentralized anymore, does it?"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: It\u2019s not decentralized, exactly.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [51:09]: So with regard to this, I look at the crypto industry and I think, The logical segmentation is: Assets versus Applications versus Currencies. It is the purpose of the crypto network to be an asset, and Bitcoin clearly is. And then Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Satoshi\u2019s Vision and the rest are trying to be. It seems pretty clear that Bitcoin is 93\u201394% of all the assets and the other ones are probably going to zero! And the only way you don\u2019t go to zero is: You have to be differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates you. It\u2019s a species, right? I can\u2019t be almost like a bunny rabbit, I need to be a wolf! I need to be different than a bunny rabbit! And it\u2019s an important caveat: Differentiated in a way that the marketplace appreciates. In other words: Differentiated in a way such that Nature gives you an advantage in natural selection. So taking Bitcoin, forking it, and making it do transactions 10 times faster isn\u2019t good enough because you\u2019re a million times slower than the other way to do transactions. So that\u2019s just not a genetic mutation that works. It\u2019s an example of a faulty genetic mutation that kills the carrier \u2014 it\u2019s an extinction-level mutation. Genetic mutations happen all the time in Nature. Most of them are mistakes. But some of them might work! If I can stand up on two feet and if my eyes start to work 10 times better than your eyes and I can fashion missiles then maybe that\u2019s gonna work for me. And maybe I will procreate. So it\u2019s not impossible to have a genetic mutation on Bitcoin that would be naturally advantageous. It\u2019s not impossible. It\u2019s just, the ones you look at right now, like, what do you have? I mean, transaction speed? That\u2019s really no good. Privacy? It\u2019s a regulatory threat and so therefore it\u2019s probably a nice thing but it\u2019s a bullseye in its forehead which means that when the regulators go to shut down crypto exchanges the first thing they\u2019ll do is pass a law against that, right? And so, give me an example of a mutation on Bitcoin that would make it a distinct asset as a store of value that would deserve to have its own life?"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: I\u2019ve thought about this a lot and written about it, and I have yet to identify one. Like Bitcoin sort of perfects the main properties of money that you need, and then the added caveat to that is that even if a mutation or innovation occurred such that the market identified it as useful and you saw this reflected in its market cap, Bitcoin also has this capacity to absorb feature set from competitors. So if something becomes market proven, Bitcoin can assimilate that into its existing UTXO set!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [54:24]: Just as living organisms do! Just as companies do! You get a tough competitor: That which does not kill me makes me stronger."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Right! Instagram absorbing Snapchat\u2019s Story feature, right? Totally destroyed Snapchat.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [54:39]: So we don\u2019t see another one right now. It\u2019s not impossible to conceptualize that maybe there would be one, but right now it looks like Bitcoin is 94% of the crypto-asset market. You can\u2019t include Ethereum because although it\u2019s proof of work now it\u2019s going to proof of stake, and they don\u2019t even have an intellectual commitment to be proof of [work 55:04]. And proof of stake is\u2014it\u2019s not clear to me that proof of stake is intellectually defensible over the long term. It\u2019s not proven. It seems like it may be defective as an idea, right? It\u2019s like an example \u2014 we\u2019re back to this issue: It\u2019s like I want to hobble the antelopes. It\u2019s like somebody complained we\u2019re using too much energy! It\u2019s almost like the environmentalists took over and they\u2019ve decided that they\u2019re just mad that someone\u2019s using too much energy so they want to pass a law to stop it. But it\u2019s a law against Mother Nature, and it\u2019s [brooding 55:44] to hobble the antelope. So the 4\u20135% of crypto-assets that are left \u2014 the Satoshi\u2019s Vision, Bitcoin Cash \u2014 none of them are differentiated enough that they would seem to have any future in a Darwinian world that I can see. So they\u2019re destined to [hugely 56:04] to go to zero. So then we go to cryptocurrencies. That\u2019s a simple one \u2014 stablecoins. People go ballistic if you say they\u2019re cryptocurrencies because everybody wants Bitcoin to be a cryptocurrency! But if the definition of currency is money that you can legally spend in a country without incurring taxes, Bitcoin is not a currency, but Tether is! Because\u2014it\u2019s kind of simple \u2014 read the IRS tax code. You\u2019ll find, most places on Earth, they\u2019re gonna tax it as an asset. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that! In fact, that\u2019s better. It\u2019s actually a mistake: Why would you want to create a short-term currency that\u2019s a billion times more expensive to implement computationally than the other way? It\u2019s like, the only reason you\u2019d want to do something a billion times more expensive is for immortality \u2014 immortal sovereignty! That\u2019s a good reason. But you\u2019ve got that. If you had that on 99% of your assets 99.9% of the time, then you\u2019re good. Then you could afford to have a little bit of risk in order to have a billion times faster performance on a digital network. So that\u2019s currencies. The only reason for a cryptocurrency is for regulatory arbitrage or maybe innovation due to decentralization. If you can make the argument that we\u2019re gonna innovate faster because we\u2019re governed by the laws of Singapore and people in Malta can use a Singaporean cryptocurrency and it\u2019s not technically illegal, it\u2019s just a hundred times better because we\u2019re able to tap into that regulatory arbitrage opportunity, you could call it a [free? 57:55] market, then I think, Okay! Fine! Then I think there\u2019s a place for a cryptocurrency."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: I guess you could add the speed factor too. That Tether can be moved 24/7, whereas US Dollars would face certain restrictions in terms of time or jurisdiction \u2014 capital controls as well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [58:16]: On the other hand you can move Apple Pay 24/7, you can move Square Cash 24/7. So there\u2019s no reason why you couldn\u2019t have run a digital network 24/7. By the way, Binance is a digital network, and you can trade 24/7 on Binance. So Binance could simply move it \u2014 if I\u2019m moving money on an exchange or between exchanges, I could do that on a digital network. I don\u2019t need a crypto network to do it! So whether or not people use a digitally-based stablecoin or a crypto stablecoin, it\u2019s a function of regulatory arbitrage. I mean there are privacy issues that people have. And then there are trust issues."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: I guess you could say Tether is a digital network in this framework. It\u2019s not decentralized. You trust a counterparty.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [59:11]: Because there\u2019s a central authority that can actually redeem, right? And so you could almost argue that if Tether is the king of stablecoins, it\u2019s running on a digital network, not a crypto network. Like, DAI \u2014 the irony is that DAI is a truly decentralized one \u2014 but people don\u2019t like it because it\u2019s inefficient and it doesn\u2019t quite peg the value. But you could create a cryptocurrency as a stablecoin using an oracle, using some information feed, and using Bitcoin as the underlying collateral and create a synthetic Dollar and a synthetic Euro! You could! And will we need it? It depends. I mean that takes us to crypto applications and digital applications. I mean Binance and Coinbase and Huobi and the like, they\u2019re digital exchanges. They\u2019re digital networks for exchange. And then you\u2019ve got the decentralized exchanges, right? Uniswap, SushiSwap. There\u2019s a very romantic notion, like, Decentralized exchanges will beat digital exchanges. I\u2019m not so sure! We\u2019ll see! The point that I made in one of my Tweets is: So I buy $400 Million worth of Bitcoin. I do it in 7 days. For 7 days, I have some exposure on a digital exchange. I move it to cold storage for the next 10 years or 20 years. So for the next 7,500 days it\u2019s off the digital exchange. So 99.9% or more of the time I\u2019m not exposed to the risk of a digital exchange, and so everyone that days, Well digital exchanges are risky. Well it\u2019s risky in the same way that walking across the street is risky, Robert. But you do it! In theory when you cross the crosswalk, if the red light failed, couldn\u2019t you get slammed into with a truck and killed? Okay, so are you gonna take the position that we\u2019re gonna have to build flyovers on every crosswalk in the world? Eh, pretty expensive! You know? So what will happen there? I don\u2019t know, but it seems to me that Binance is doing just fine as a centralized exchange. And it seems that Square works fine as a digital client application. And if Apple Computer announced that you could send Bitcoin or cash via Apple Pay or iMessage tomorrow, I think a lot of people would be pretty happy to do that! No one would be complaining about it! And it really comes down to this issue of: Economy \u2014 it\u2019s a million times cheaper, Performance \u2014 it\u2019s a million times faster, Functionality \u2014 it\u2019s a million times more functional, and Compliance \u2014 they\u2019re probably more compliant in the country you\u2019re in! So if you can do it on a digital network, you probably will! When you think about crypto, you really have to ask this question: What is so important that I want immortal sovereignty? What is so important? And certainly my life force. If you said to me, Michael, I\u2019m gonna take all of your energy and I\u2019m going to protect it and I\u2019m going to fulfill your wishes from now to 1,000 years from now \u2014 I think that\u2019s worth it! That\u2019s a religion! That\u2019s a crypto! You know, I have a park. I\u2019d like for the park to be trimmed and the trees to be kept nice and I\u2019d like for the park to be beautiful for the next 1,000 years and it\u2019ll cost $1 Million a year. And so if I put $50 Million into endowment and it generates 2% yield, then I could reasonably say to Robert, Robert, why don\u2019t you take my $50 Million endowment and put it into Bitcoin. And then it becomes the question of: How am I gonna see my wishes through for 1,000 years? Well the current way you would do it is you would create an institution like the Rockefeller Institution or the Hughes Institute. [1:04:08] And you trust human beings. What we\u2019re really talking about is: We\u2019re talking about the crypto-asset network of Bitcoin taking the base layer and holding all the monetary energy for 1,000 years. Or 100 years, if you think 1,000 years is crazy \u2014 we\u2019ll go 100 years. And then we\u2019re talking about a digital network. Maybe it\u2019s gardners.com or Amazon will probably do it because they\u2019ll probably do everything by the time we get through the decade. There will be nothing that they\u2019re not doing! Let me make it easier: Let\u2019s just say I want to send flowers to everyone in my family on their birthday for the next 100 years with a little note from me telling them how much I love them \u2014 that\u2019s a simpler thing. I endow an account with Bitcoin, I create an Amazon account, I wire it up with flowers, I create some kind of mechanism so that when children are born they get added to the family unit, and the thing drips out a little bit of monetary energy in Bitcoin, converts to fiat, buys the flowers for $187,000 a dozen roses in the year 2047, and it ships them for the person, and I die happy, and for the next 100 or 1,000 years, flowers get delivered to people in the Saylor family line because that was my last will and testament! And how would I do it if I was John D. Rockefeller 100 years ago? I would have a crapload of assets, probably a lot of gold and stock \u2014 and he owned every oil company and they\u2019re still around \u2014 and then you would put some of that into a foundation. A non-profit foundation, because you need tax-free, tax-advantaged. That\u2019s why you need to go non-profit. By the way, all of your capital gains become tax free, tax-advantaged, and all your income becomes tax-advantaged, right? So that\u2019s a good idea. And then you have a board of governance and you have 5 advisors and they appoint a money manager and they appoint a business manager and when one of them retires they have a selection committee process that puts someone else. We\u2019re probably on the 7th generation of advisors to the Rockefeller Institute. By the way, John D. Rockefeller created the University of Chicago. It\u2019s still running. Rockefeller created a lot of stuff that\u2019s still running! Rockefeller University. So I can do it the old-fashioned way, but to do it well you\u2019re probably talking about $100 Million of assets and a $5 Million a year operating budget. You get down to $1\u20132 Million it\u2019s not really \u2014 $5 Million a year is the minimum. Your best bet is you have to become a university, a religion, a church, or a non-profit, a Hughes Institute. So that\u2019s the way that you get immortal sovereignty, or like some long-range sovereignty. Another standard way people do it is like, Rockefeller bought up all the land on the Hudson River and he gives it to the state of New York, turn it into a state park or national park like Grand Teton National Park, and you get the federal government, the state government to agree to fund it in perpetuity per the Smithsonian Institution. The problem with all those things is that sometimes you just can\u2019t even trust the governments, right? But your best bet is you lay it off on a state or a federal government, and that\u2019s okay until the government fails or it reneges on something or other. The bottom line is that it\u2019s not really within the grasp of a small or mid-size business or the individual. What is YouTube? YouTube allows you to become your own TV station! So what are we talking about here? The clich\u00e9, Be your own bank, if we look at it a different way it\u2019s like, I\u2019m a normal person, I endow my own monetary energy into Bitcoin, I plug it into to some digital network, I give the keys to someone I trust \u2014 family member, heir \u2014 maybe I do multisig, right? Instead of having 5 people on a board \u2014 if you have 5 people on a board of an endowment with $100 Million or $1 Billion in the endowment, they\u2019re kept honest by filing annual tax forms with the IRS. And in theory they could be personally liable if they defraud the foundation or abuse their fiduciary trust. But you know it\u2019s kind of like a 20th Century idea! A better idea would be: I put the money into Bitcoin and I have 3 or 5 digital keys. And it takes 3 out of the 5 to vote on anything. And every 3 months they have to register that they\u2019re online and of healthy mind and spirit, and if someone stops registering then that remaining 4 automatically appoint a 5th, and whenever anybody retires they automatically transfer their key, and then what I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve dematerialized an endowment, board of directors, corporation, institution. And it\u2019s just become maybe a simple application in cyberspace plugged into a base layer of monetary energy. And it\u2019s doing something! Whatever the something is. And so that\u2019s a combination of (1) people and (2) digital networks and (3) crypto networks in order to allow people to achieve their hopes and desires over long periods of time."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [1:10:19]: That\u2019s really interesting that you can lock up the base layer money and then appoint this multisig schema as almost a decentralized organization, in a way, among these 5 members. And then that gives the ability for your will and testament to be carried out in a more dynamic way across time. As governments fail, organizational landscape changes, or other macroeconomic conditions change, these 5 people can adapt. So they\u2019re sitting on this money that you\u2019ve put behind the wall of encrypted energy, but it also gives it some dynamism in a way, that they can adapt to your will and testament.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [1:11:00]: Until computers get so smart that they do it all for us, the most likely outcome is: I appoint 3 or 5 people, and then they plug into digital networks that do all the stuff that we want done. Maybe you want to host all of your writings and all of your videos for the next 1,000 years in cyberspace. Okay so you appoint 3 trustees of the Breedlove Institute, you endow it with some amount of Bitcoin. You live a fine life, you depart, and their rules are: Every 10 years they have to find someone to replace them. You put your own term limits in there! By the way, you could put all sorts of rules in. You could say that everyone that actually reads my stuff and passes the test can vote on who the 5 trustees are gonna be. Or, you can\u2019t even be a trustee unless you\u2019ve watched and read everything and understood everything and passed my quiz that I left for you. What if Ludwig von Mises left all of his stuff in cyberspace and we\u2019d need to read all his stuff and pass it and pass an oral exam by him in order to become a fellow. And if we become a fellow we\u2019re invited into the academy of Austrian Economists, and that goes on to all eternity. And then the academy adds to the body of knowledge and they can upgrade the protocols and they can upgrade the tests and they can pass the flame down from generation to generation and the entire thing becomes antifragile and it\u2019s the religion of Austrian Economics! I\u2019m thinking the guild system. If you want something to be an immortal sovereign crypto network, then you think like the guilds. It\u2019s gotta be something that people are so passionate about they\u2019ll pass it down from parent to child, father to son, mother to daughter, master to student. There are things like that: schools of martial arts, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, religions, etc. And the medieval guilds were like that! Maybe there would be a \u2014 for example, I like environmental causes. What if I had a park and I said, Well people have to go in and they have to work in the park and support the park, but the park is this private/public entity where you can be a member and you get to use it but only if you can contribute to it and protect it. And then I endow it and it becomes a self-sovereign entity for 1,000 years. It\u2019s like a park-owner\u2019s association, right?"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [1:15:28]: It\u2019s so interesting that another way to think about money is a medium for expressing preferences. When you buy a car or sell a house the economy responds dynamically by making more cars and less houses. So now with Bitcoin you can actually express these preferences transcendentally of space and time! You can express them, in theory, for all eternity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: I\u2019ll give you two examples: All the time you have examples of rich donors if they endow a professoral chair at a university and the money gets hijacked to build a new football stadium. Or, I want to endow a professorship of Austrian Economics \u2014 but then someone takes over the university and so they divert the money to buy a new hot dog truck. So\u2014I\u2019m dead \u2014 how do I make sure that someone doesn\u2019t, that they really fulfill my last dying wish? How do I make sure? Well I can do it if I have a Rockefeller Institute and they hold the purse strings and they dole it out annually and then they watch. But then I have to actually have a bunch of people that I trust that 100 years from now will remember what my wishes were! And maybe nobody cares about that. It\u2019s a challenge for people. I went to Naples this year. And if you go to Naples, you go into the port, you have all these superyachts in the port, and very very wealthy people on the superyachts. But if you walk out of the port there\u2019s puddles on the floor and there\u2019s this park in the middle of Naples right next to the port and it runs about 10 blocks. And 50 years ago it was beautiful and the jewel of Naples and it was like Central Park and everyone could come there and enjoy the day. Now if you walk through it, all the buildings are spray-painted, they\u2019re all closed, there\u2019s pooling stinking water, no grass grows, it\u2019s just mud. It looks like something 40 years after the apocalypse! It\u2019s in the middle of like the third largest city in Italy. There\u2019s money everywhere, and yet somehow neither the municipal government nor the state nor the federal government of Italy, nor any wealthy person, can manage to come up with $100,000 Euros a year to water the grass and mow the lawn. In the middle of a city of a million people \u2014 the public jewel the city, the single most important piece of real estate in the entire city\u2014is suffering from a tragedy of the commons. Now I ask myself: If I was that wealthy person and I wanted to bring that park to life, if you wanted to do it top-notch you need $1 Million Euros a year. You want to do spectacular? $10 Million Euros a year. If you want to just mow the lawn and water it and keep it from being a stinking, mud-infesting war zone? $100,000 Euros a year. How do I actually endow that park without having the money hijacked by whoever hijacked the money? Because obviously none of the economic energy is making it to that park in the middle of Naples. It might be a more worthy cause just giving a third of my money to the government as tax on my death, or two-thirds when I die for them to \u2014 whatever they\u2019re doing, like, What could you say about a civilization that can\u2019t keep its central park in its most important city in the province from being a stinking, post-apocalyptic zone?"}

You think 501c3 law just came out of nowhere? I mean, all of these laws, they were created! John D. Rockefeller\u2019s son married Abby Aldrich.

And Nelson Aldrich was the head of the Senate Banking Committee \u2014 happened to be key in the creation of the Federal Reserve \u2014 but he was one of the most powerful men in the country for quite a long time. And so there was an example where they were working to influence the political system, and critics say they influenced it to the detriment of people, but you can also see many ways they influenced it to the benefit of people! If you\u2019ve ever enjoyed a national park, half of them are endowed by guys like Rockefeller!"}

I think ultimately we\u2019re moving into an exciting world where people are gonna be able to achieve great things with a variety of digital networks and crypto networks. What we can see right now for sure is: There is at least one successful crypto network \u2014 Bitcoin \u2014 there are many successful dominant digital networks \u2014 YouTube, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, etc., plenty of them \u2014and the future is gonna be defined by these networks, and you just gotta decide what\u2019s the best tool for the problem? You can solve problems with people. I can pick up the phone, I can call you and I can say, Robert, buy me $100 Million worth of Bitcoin! And I solve the problem with a person. Or I can solve the problem with a digital network. I can go online on Binance and I can start like typing and trading, and I can buy $100 Million worth of Bitcoin. Or I could solve the problem with Uniswap \u2014 with a decentralized total crypto network. What will happen? The market will determine\u2014what we know is that over time, what was done by people will start to be done with digital networks, and what was done by digital networks may in fact float into crypto networks to the extent that sovereign immortality is worth the trouble. And if you\u2019re gonna make a crypto network \u2014 if they\u2019re just doing it for regulatory arbitrage it\u2019s probably got a 10-year life span and it\u2019s shaky \u2014 because who\u2019s gonna lay down in front of a tank for something like the difference between Binance and Uniswap? Would you sacrifice your life to try to trade on Uniswap instead of Binance? Because I wouldn\u2019t! Let me tell you what they\u2019ll lay down in front of a tank for: They\u2019ll lay down in front of a tank for Freedom, for their Religious Values, for the Future of their Family, for the Future of their Ideology. If they have a passionate belief, they will lay down in front of a tank in order to defend it. The principles of Science and Justice and Humanity and Truth. Not everybody! But you don\u2019t need everybody! You need the keepers of the flame. You need the maximalists. The 1% who are willing to fight and die for the principles. We hold these truths to be self-evident. We didn\u2019t come up with it here today in this call. It was a basic truth that founded a lot of things including the United States of America. And if you go back to the Roman Republic, there were a lot of Romans when the Roman Republic was healthy, and they were willing to fight and die for Roman principles. To a certain extent, a lot of good Romans assassinated Julius Caesar because they thought they were fighting for Roman principles. And a lot of wars were fought over it. So if you really want a crypto to be successful over 100 years, the technology is only a part of it, right? It\u2019s the ideology paired with the technology. And you\u2019re gonna have to have an ideology that is so pure and so straightforward that people will fight to the death to defend the ideology. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m probably not gonna sacrifice my life for the 13th iteration on smart contracts! It\u2019s not that important! On the other hand, if you tell me that we\u2019re about to suck all of the economic energy out of the civilization and plunge ourselves into the Dark Ages, then I think I\u2019ll fight for it. That\u2019s worth fighting for."}

They all have that immunity. That\u2019s herd immunity, whatever that might be. And that\u2019s the beauty of Bitcoin.

The antelope ran too fast! Not fair! Slow them down! The transaction fees were too high! Not fair! Make them lower! We\u2019ll hobble them for you. Okay? It\u2019s also a metaphor for interest rates.

That is one of the things that\u2019s gotten us into the situation that we\u2019re in today with low and negative interest rates.

Entropy is at [work]\u2014 time must move forward. Trying to drive interest rates to zero or negative is a war on time. You\u2019re trying to make time go backwards! You\u2019re trying to make water flow uphill. You\u2019re trying to reverse gravity. You\u2019re trying to reverse the laws of thermodynamics. It\u2019s me saying to you, Robert, will you give me everything that you own \u2014 give it to me \u2014 you go without, I\u2019m going to keep it, and when you die I\u2019m going to give a third of it back to your heirs!

Bitcoin is an incredible store of value. I think that\u2019s its primary use case, or its killer value proposition now and probably for the next decade \u2014 maybe forever! The entire world is looking for a store of value right now, and you have to look across $250 Trillion of assets. If we think that asset inflation is running north of 10% \u2014 and I think it is, I think it\u2019s pretty clear it is \u2014 and if you have capital, you have to choose between bonds, $80 Trillion in sovereign debt or corporate debt or municipal debt, or mortgage-backed securities, or you gotta choose equities, tech equity, conventional equity, or you gotta go to precious metals, or you go to real property, real estate property. And when you look at all of those things, the problem is half of all real estate is impaired because of the political response to COVID, and it\u2019s not likely that\u2019s gonna change in the next 10 years. We\u2019ve probably got 10 years of uncertainty about real estate assets, especially commercial real estate assets. The other challenge with real estate is the taxes on it. It\u2019s illiquid, immobile, and highly taxed. Generally real estate is taxed annually everywhere, it\u2019s just a question of whether it\u2019s 20 basis points or 200 basis points. So that makes real estate a challenging store of value. And that takes you to bonds: Bonds have worked as a store of value when the interest rates keep going lower. You can see that everybody that\u2019s been on the bond train and benefiting from it, they\u2019re screaming as loud as they can: They want negative interest rates! Because they\u2019re like \u2014 The secret to success is lower the interest rates 50 basis points a year or 100 basis points a year and it\u2019s a no-lose proposition \u2014 for them. But at this point it\u2019s getting kind of ridiculous silly because when interest rates go negative everybody takes their money out of the bank, it creates bank runs, all the bank systems break. It\u2019s kind of a morally bankrupt \u2014 I mean a lot of people, they don\u2019t really understand that they\u2019re being abused at 2% instead of 5%. But pretty much everybody can figure out that when you\u2019re being billed 1% of the money you have at a bank, you\u2019re being abused!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Yeah! And again if you look at money as an insurance policy on uncertainty and all of a sudden that policy has negative value \u2014 it\u2019s just asinine! It doesn\u2019t make any economic sense!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [28:02]: Yeah so that doesn\u2019t work, and so where does that take us? It takes us to equity. We\u2019ve got an equity bubble that\u2019s a very crowded trade, but the real issue with equity as a store of value is that the revenue gets taxed as sales tax, the cash flows get taxed as income tax, the expenses \u2014 the cost structure gets taxed as employee and payroll tax. Then the trade gets taxed \u2014 there\u2019s a tariff. Then you have the existential threat or regulatory risk of onerous regulations. Pick up the paper and see maybe Australia\u2019s gonna bill Google every time they link to a newspaper article, and then if Google doesn\u2019t link the newspaper articles they\u2019re gonna get fined for not linking the newspaper articles! And as these things become more powerful, they become regulated utilities and politicians start to think that they can and should be regulated \u2014 and maybe with good cause! If there\u2019s only one provider of information anywhere in the country then it definitely becomes a political issue. So that\u2019s the challenge with equities: they might work for 2, 3, 4 years, but they\u2019re valued as a multiple of cash flows. So if all of the liquidity of the civilization gets squeezed out of debt \u2014 when interest gets to zero \u2014 the government and the Fed owns all the debt. Okay, they bought me out \u2014 now I gotta put it in something else so I jump on equities so now equities double. But now the P/Es double or triple, and the revenue multiples triple. What\u2019s the value of an equity? The value of equity should in theory be tangible assets on the balance sheet plus the sum of the discounted cash flows. And so people are using equities as store of value today. In fact you could make the argument that equities are the most popular store of value for the majority with their Robinhood trading \u2014 they\u2019re all buying Apple, Amazon, Facebook, NASDAQ, SPDRs \u2014 everybody! Even though nobody thinks revenues are going up this year, nobody thinks earnings are going up this year, but equity values have doubled this year. Well that means that they\u2019re getting riskier! So if you contrast Bitcoin to equity, the problem is: if the price of an equity goes up by a factor of 10, you\u2019ve got more risk because it\u2019s delaminating from its underlying cash flows and its fundamentals. Because it is a centralized, regulated entity, and the only way that the cash flows are going to grow into that value is they keep raising the price. And if they\u2019re a monopoly and the raise the price, the regulators will react. If they don\u2019t raise the price, they can\u2019t grow into the multiple! And so you kind of have a chicken and the egg thing, right? And if there\u2019s any competition and their cash flows deteriorate, eventually you\u2019re trading at 200:1 or 200 P/E, and then any degree of disappointment causes massive volatility. And how are they different than Bitcoin? Well, Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition is the liquidity, it is the store of value \u2014 that is it! If you\u2019re going to function as money, you want to be a single-celled organism \u2014 like the algae of the ecosystem. The base layer of the ecosystem that\u2019s plankton or bacteria or single cells. You don\u2019t want to be a vertebrate! And these companies are vertebrates with a brain and a backbone, and that means \u2014 for example, WeChat or TikTok has a headquarters \u2014 and if it\u2019s in the wrong country, it gets its head chopped off. And Apple and Facebook, they\u2019re subject to a certain court, a certain country\u2019s jurisdiction. So that means they\u2019re foreigners somewhere else! They\u2019re vertebrate. If you\u2019re a vertebrate, I can kill you with a needle. A human being I can figure out how to kill: there\u2019s a heart, I take a needle, I poke there \u2014 you\u2019re gone. You\u2019re very fragile. Hard to do that with a swarm of hornets. Hard to do that with all the plankton in the ocean. It\u2019s very difficult to do it with an amorphous decentralized invertebrate of some sort. So if you want a store of value, you don\u2019t want a company that\u2019s valued based upon the ability to engineer hyper-complicated products that have to keep getting upgraded. You want something which is simple, that can just keep things simple. This is again where some of the crypto-enthusiasts, they keep wanting to tinker with a better blockchain, a better crypto. You know, they never saw an upgrade they didn\u2019t like so they just wanna keep revving it every year. Like it\u2019s the iPhone version 37. There\u2019s a fundamental difference, which is: if there\u2019s a bug in the iPhone version 37, everybody in the world\u2019s heart doesn\u2019t stop!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Right! I think this analogy you\u2019re using with the simplicity of plankton being the base layer for the ecosystem is apt. I want to say plankton makes up the majority of the biomass on the planet by a pretty substantial margin because it\u2019s so simple and it\u2019s so efficient at converting solar energy into biological energy. And then it is the base layer for this multiplicity of layered ecosystem that we have in the world. And another thing I think is interesting is that you make a great point that equities are becoming more risky as they increase in price, because they\u2019re delaminating from their valuation fundamentals as you said. And Bitcoin\u2019s the opposite. Actually the more valuable Bitcoin is, the more secure it\u2019s network, the greater the liquidity, the more resistant it is to attack. So it\u2019s a very interesting counter-trade to equities as a store of value.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [34:24]: And of course, if you have an individual entity with an individual headquarters and a CEO, as it gets bigger it becomes a bigger target. But maybe everybody in your home country loves you! But what about everybody in every other country? So you don\u2019t want a head, and you don\u2019t want to be a target, and you don\u2019t want to be valued based on cash flows if you\u2019re going to be money. They\u2019re the right creature to be building a device or maybe creating an exchange or creating an application, because \u2014 there \u2014 I want the software to run a billion times faster, and so it\u2019s okay to have one company write software! The question is: I want it to run a billion times faster, but do I need it to last for a thousand years? And the answer is: I could throw my phone away and Western Civilization will not end if I lose my phone or if you screw up my phone, right? It will not end! If I put all the energy of civilization into a crypto network, I can\u2019t afford for someone to, like, ship a buggy release! And again, what people forget is: if I put $1 Billion into Bitcoin on January 1st, 2021 and I don\u2019t touch it for 100 years, the thing is working! Truly insanely great technology is \u2014 okay we\u2019re back to Nicholas Taleb haunting our thoughts \u2014 via negativa, right? Add by taking away. Insanely great technology is when it does a thing without you doing a thing! You know, a junior technologist, they create gadgets. I have a mobile application that has 150 features and 150 buttons and then you click and there\u2019s a billion different things it can do depending upon the combination of the buttons and the features you click on\u2014okay that\u2019s one thing. How about another mobile app? You download a mobile app and everywhere you walk on Earth it kills all your enemies and gives you infinite food and water and protection and plays whatever music you wanted to hear around you without you touching it \u2014 hands-free. If I walk around and someone walks behind me and they do everything I want before I ask them to do it \u2014 without me opening my mouth \u2014 isn\u2019t that a heck of a lot better than a gadgety thing with features?"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Yeah! It\u2019s higher utility!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [37:30]: Well, it\u2019s Saint-Exup\u00e9ry \u2014 the design\u2019s not done, it\u2019s not a perfect design until there\u2019s nothing left to remove. And so if I told you: Take all your money, put it into Bitcoin, and then you\u2019ll be rich and happy and prosperous for all of eternity without doing a single transaction \u2014 that\u2019s a lot better idea!"}

{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [38:13]: You\u2019re right, absolutely! Just to give the listeners a little bit of context for via negativa \u2014 for those who haven\u2019t read Taleb: His canonical example in his book The Black Swan where you can see as many white swans as you want, but you can never prove by virtue of that evidence that all swans are white, but with a single sighting of a black swan you have disproven that all swans are white. So the moral of the story is that disconfirmation is more rigorous than confirmation. And I think that\u2019s getting to your point here is that it\u2019s getting stronger by taking away. Your factual base on which you\u2019re building your premise and strategy in the world is strengthened by disconfirmation moreso than it is by confirmation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [39:08]: And I\u2019ll give you another example that we see all the time with Google: You go into Google, you ask the wrong question and misspell it and it gives you the right answer! That\u2019s a truly great piece of software: You ask the wrong question and it gives you the right answer because it knows which question you should\u2019ve asked and it knows how you should\u2019ve spelled it and said, We\u2019re gonna answer this question for you instead because the odds that you really wanted to know this question answered is 99,000,000:1! The odds that you really were asking a unique question that seems foolish and misspelling a popular name while you\u2019re asking it\u2014that\u2019s 1 in a billion! So if you really wanted to ask the wrong question the wrong way you try it twice, but 99.999% of the time they give you the right answer to the wrong question and they do it because they built this very fault-tolerant, common-sense, rational interface. So back to store of value, right? Bitcoin is an ideal store of value because it\u2019s got the ability to convey your energy not across 10,000 miles but across 10,000 days. 30 years into the future. 100 years into the future. Most people when they\u2019re investing in assets, they\u2019re taking this very short term view of like the next month, the next year, the next two years, and I find that if you\u2019re looking at a 3-year time frame, everything gets very very noisy and complicated and there\u2019s all these debates. But if you really want to end the debates, go out to 100 years and just take $100 Million and go through the exercise of giving it to someone \u2014 your heir\u2019s heir\u2019s heir in 100 years. And then all of a sudden, all this noise drops away. Can I put it into real estate? No, it\u2019ll be taxed out of existence in 100 years. Can I put it in gold? No, 98% of it will be gone if 100% of it isn\u2019t gone in 100 years because we mine it to death. Can I put it into fiat? No it\u2019s gonna be inflated to death. Can I invest it in a company? No, name one company that\u2019s around today that was around 100 years ago that hasn\u2019t been diluted, recapitalized, etc. Can I put it in a stock index? Well, you\u2019re trusting a human being to rebalance the index over and over again. What stock index do you trust for the next 100 years? And by the way it\u2019s got counterparty risk at the nation state level. The nation might not be there, and 90% didn\u2019t make it! So what are you left with? And the truth is, when you just do that thought experiment it\u2019s pretty obvious: You would put it in a crypto network, in a decentralized proof of work network if the adherents \u2014 the maximalists \u2014 were fanatic zealots about protecting the integrity of the network against meddlers who would screw it up. If the network is supported by those with a religious conviction to the network such that you could imagine 100 years from now there will still be people protecting the network \u2014 the phrase is, Keepers of the flame. Every great religion, every great institution has keepers of the flame, and there must be passion. Do you believe in your religion? Do you believe strong enough that you\u2019ll flee persecution to continue to practice it? The United States was built on the foundation of separation of church and state, and it\u2019s a pretty important and interesting metaphor: People came here because they could practice their religion! That\u2019s why they came here! And they came here because their religion was above their government. They would not sacrifice whatever it is they believed in. If you look at every institution that lasts more than 100 years \u2014 name them: Harvard University, Cambridge, Oxford, the Catholic Church, Islamic sects, the Jewish faith \u2014 there\u2019s not that many! There\u2019s churches or religious sects and then there\u2019s some educational institutions \u2014 and I see the educational institutions being shaken at their core this year! I mean literally you could\u2019ve said for 500 years \u2014 Ivy Leagues, the elite universities \u2014 they\u2019re stalwart institutions. They have lost a huge amount of credibility this year! When you send all of your students home and you close the campus and people are studying virtually, people\u2019s affiliation to the bricks and mortar of the institution has been dramatically weakened unless they morph into a virtual institution. The virtual institutions by the way have dramatically strengthened, right? Your affiliation with YouTube and Facebook and Apple TV and Bitcoin and Square Cash has dramatically strengthened. If it\u2019s virtual. And your affiliation with the bricks and mortar physical institution has been weakened. And those that will survive have dematerialized and virtualized and they\u2019ve learned how to project their ethos in cyberspace. So yeah, back to the store of value: You need people \u2014 human beings, flesh and blood people \u2014 that are going to keep the flame. And the flame of Bitcoin is the node and the mining rig. We\u2019re getting into Bitcoin as religion or as faith now, but imagine 1,000 years ago, I want to keep a religion alive \u2014 I have an altar in my home. Every wealthy person had a chapel in their home. If you look at religions, go to the Far East, there are altars in Buddhist, Shinto, other faiths. So the idea of an altar or a shrine or a cathedral or a church \u2014 these are structures where people go to worship, and the worshiping is the feeding of the flame. And oftentimes during the worshiping they\u2019re tithing and they\u2019re channeling 10% of their money as energy into these religions in order to keep them relevant! If you look at fantasy fiction, in fantasy where they have gods, the strength of the god is a function of the devoutness of the worshipers, of the followers. Such and such was worshiped as the god of the forest, and they are worshiped as the god of the forest and all of their adherents \u2014 all their acolytes \u2014 are feeding energy to the god of the forest. And when they\u2019re no longer worshiped, their energy goes away! If you lose your faithful, if they won\u2019t feed you with the fire of truth, with the energy that you need, your efficacy falls and you die. And so how do you feed a fire, right? If it\u2019s a physical fire you have to throw wood on the fire. How do you feed a religion? You have to tithe \u2014 the Catholic Church, or any church \u2014 you have to give it money, and maybe you have to give it your life service. Onward Christian soldiers! I will fight for the cause. I will donate to the cause. That\u2019s how you feed a religious institution. How do you feed a crypto network? You gotta spin up facilities of encrypted energy that adhere to the protocol. Every time a miner comes onboard it\u2019s feeding the fire. Every time a node comes onboard it\u2019s gonna certify and validate. It\u2019s protecting. It\u2019s creating one more chain in the fault-tolerance structure. And that\u2019s why a smaller crypto \u2014 a crypto that\u2019s a technical experiment, that\u2019s an application \u2014 isn\u2019t the good store of value. Because if the people are willing to fork it, if they\u2019re willing to fork it and abandon it in order to [move to 48:44] a new technology, then the flame dies. And so it\u2019s pretty clear that Bitcoin maximalists, they have a lot of the faith and the conviction of true believers in any religious faith for the past 2,000 years. And why wouldn\u2019t they? Because they share the same values. Their values are: Truth, Nature, Natural Laws, Laws of Physics, Laws of Thermodynamics, Math, Austrian Economics, No such thing as a free lunch, Self-Reliance, Honesty, Fairness, Technology Advances. They share those values. They\u2019re taking their monetary energy and tokenizing it on a Bitcoin network with Bitcoin. Bitcoin is that single shared store of value. If money is energy and energy begets life and a crypto decentralized network gives you sovereignty, that\u2019s a path to immortality, and that means that everybody in the Bitcoin community that believes in this for the long term is engaged in the pursuit of immortal life. And pursuit of immortal life sounds like a religious mantra, I think! And I grew up in the Southern Baptist faith so I\u2019m very familiar with the ideology of Christianity and pursuit of immortal life is pretty paramount there."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: I did as well! That\u2019s interesting.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [50:41]: And if Bitcoin is a store of value for 100 years, then it is a technique through which you can project your values through time. So if you\u2019re not actually providing for a better life for yourself, you\u2019re providing for a better life for your family or your loved ones of your friends. Or perhaps your values are you want to support a dog park and you want to endow the dog park for 100 years. Or what if you want to endow an environment cause or Save the Seals or Save the Whales. It doesn\u2019t really matter what the cause is \u2014 cure cancer, do this, go to the stars \u2014 when I die I want all of my wealth to be used to make education free for everyone forever! That actually is one of my values and I have a foundation, the Saylor Foundation, which gives away free education to hundreds of thousands of people. That\u2019s a value! Other people want to go to outer space. If I can channel my energy and put it into a network and that network can be used to fund and power an endowment that will do that thing, then that Bitcoin network or that crypto network is going to be my mechanism for achieving all of my hopes and aspirations from now to eternity."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [52:18]: That\u2019s an amazing point! And I would even conceive of that as a mechanism almost of the afterlife. It\u2019s a way to carry your will beyond your own life. And the American mythologist Joseph Campbell, he described religion as a story that points toward the transcendental mystery that we all experience but cannot articulate. And so all religious traditions, mythological traditions, are stories pointing toward a higher truth. And I find it interesting that Bitcoin has higher truth embedded in code! This 21 Million number is quite literally transcendental: We can\u2019t touch it, we can\u2019t change it, we can\u2019t do anything about it. Every 10 minutes it\u2019s promulgating the most indisputable truth that we\u2019ve ever had. It\u2019s true global consensus. So it\u2019s not just a metaphor I think to call Bitcoin religious, it quite actually is religious!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [53:32]: If you worshiped Science, if you worshiped the Laws of Physics and the Laws of Thermodynamics and Mathematical clarity, then Bitcoin\u2019s your religion! And that\u2019s what takes us out of the range of simple asset debates. If your time horizon is 10 years we can debate Bitcoin this versus Apple stock that versus Amazon versus bonds versus whatever. And when your time horizon is 3 years, by the way, it all is just in the domain of macro traders and cute arbitragers and everyone wants to tell you about the Fibonacci this, triangle thing, and that\u2019s over-bought and this is over-sold and my head kind of explodes trying to figure that out, but the truth is I just don\u2019t care! Being right in the next 2 years strikes me as being a bad idea because in order to be right as a trader in the near-term, I have to turn off the part of my brain that thinks about what\u2019s true and honest and morally hazardous or rational. You literally have to be like, I know it\u2019s stupid to go this way but since everybody else is gonna go this way I\u2019m gonna do something stupid now because I think I\u2019m less stupid but more stupid than they are stupid \u2014 it\u2019s just not a way to live."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [55:10]: Yeah and the problem is if I lose trying to act stupid then I really was stupid! And if I win acting kind of irrational, crazy, then I don\u2019t respect myself. And meanwhile a much simpler idea is just figure out what\u2019s gonna go up by a factor of 100 or 1,000 and just go stand there and wait for entropy to take its course, and wait for gravity to take its effect, and let the water flow downhill, and let the fire burn, and don\u2019t dash around while the fire\u2019s burning everything \u2014 stand up and watch it! So the solution there is: You move from 3 years to 10 years, and then you move from 10 years to 100 years. And at the 100-year time frame it\u2019s pretty clear what\u2019s an asset and what\u2019s a store of value! And it\u2019s just very obvious: (A) Bitcoin is a store of value if its believers have religious conviction in it. It becomes very simple. Now, if you step out to a 1,000-year time frame and you say, What\u2019s this thing gotta be in order to last 1,000 years? It better be the worship of Math and the Laws of Thermodynamics and the Laws of Physics and Einstein and Newton! That might make it! And if we just focus upon that and don\u2019t let all this other stuff get mired \u2014 I mean, that\u2019s reasonable! People have been studying and honoring Math and Algebra for 2,000 years, they\u2019ve been honoring Calculus for 400 years. You could say this is truly the adoption of economics as a science. It\u2019s that critical inflection point where economics went from being a political preference to being a science, and if you adopt it as a science then you actually get massive advantages technically. And if you reject it, I guess it\u2019s kind of like the guys in the Dark Ages and they could accept Calculus or they could reject Calculus."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: And what he meant was: It doesn\u2019t matter how strong your defenses are if I can bribe the gatekeeper! The third example we have in modern history is the Maginot Line, where the French built this impenetrable defense against the Germans and the Germans simply went around it through Belgium \u2014 by cheating! They hacked it! They just ducked it! And if you think about the lessons of military history, one of the lessons is: The best defense is a good offense. And another way to look at it is that if you want a good defense, you need an active defense \u2014 a moving defense! You\u2019re a boxer in a ring and someone wants to hit you \u2014 your best defense is that you move quicker than them and you hit faster and harder than them while they\u2019re getting ready to hit you \u2014 and so they can\u2019t!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Right, it has to be adaptive! The defense has to respond to the nature of the offense continually."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Continually! Continuous adaptation, absorption of your enemy\u2019s capabilities and reaction and you play them back at them! And so when we think about gold \u2014 I\u2019ve affectionately deemed gold the dumb rock \u2014 it\u2019s a rock! It\u2019s not intelligent! It\u2019s not a life force! A coral reef is a life form! All forms of life \u2014 they\u2019re living! They\u2019re adaptive! If you kill the weak element, the ones you didn\u2019t kill get stronger! With regard to Bitcoin, it\u2019s composed of a number of elements: there\u2019s software \u2014 the software is running on hardware. The hardware is running in facilities that are plugged into the firmament of some domain. There are people that are running that software, that are operating those facilities, that are building that hardware. And those people are also acting in the political domain and the economic domain, right? There are people in the Bitcoin ecosystem that are improving the Square wallet, they\u2019re improving the Binance exchange. So they\u2019re improving the back end server exchanges, they\u2019re improving the front end client software, they\u2019re improving the hardware wallets, they\u2019re improving the Bitcoin Core software, they\u2019re improving the ASICs that the miners are running, there are people negotiating with governments everywhere on Earth to get better electricity, there are people that are negotiating with politicians to get better regulatory treatment, there are people that are marketing Bitcoin and there are educators \u2014 yourself, on YouTube! There are people on Twitter, there are communicators, there are analysts that are creating analytical functions that are being used to drive and channel the network. They\u2019re all moving! They\u2019re all evolving! They are strong exchanges getting stronger! There are weak exchanges getting weaker, right? We see that all around us! There are countries where Bitcoin mining is flourishing, there are countries where Bitcoin mining is under attack. Gold is a dumb rock \u2014 it is sitting on the floor. Gold is not going to move itself! Gold is not going to feel pain! It\u2019s not gonna feel pity, it\u2019s not gonna feel inspiration \u2014 it\u2019s just going to lie there and wait. And Bitcoin is a different thing! So the antifragility of Bitcoin comes from the fact that everybody in the ecosystem feels the same pain in the same way. If Bitcoin\u2019s price goes down, every Bitcoin HODLer feels it! If Bitcoin is hacked and goes to zero, every Bitcoiner loses their life\u2019s energy! We are a hive creature all integrated with one another\u2014and when there is that pain it spreads very quickly through the entire ecosystem! The information flows rapidly! So if we consider threats to Bitcoin \u2014 a lot of people, they always whine \u2014 I hear this whine, Well what about the quantum computer? What about the quantum computer? And I wanna say, Yeah! And what if an asteroid hits the Earth and kills us all? Or, what about a pocket thermonuclear pencil that blows up the entire universe and what if your enemy gets it before you did? I mean there\u2019s a lot of silly notions of that \u2014 What if somebody had the impossibly powerful weapon and they\u2019re evil and they decide to use it on you? You could look at it that way, but I think a more constructive way to look at it is: If someone comes up with a computer that runs twice as fast as the current computers! The most profitable use of the computer is Bitcoin mining! If someone comes up with something which mines, that generates SHA-256 crypto hashes faster than the current generation of Bitcoin mining equipment, the most lucrative thing you can do with it is plug it into the network and start to contribute more hash rate! And so, who do you think is gonna notice first when that thing happens? If someone comes up with a better \u2014 Well what happens when it gets so powerful that it can break SHA-256? Well, dudes, we\u2019re just gonna go to SHA-512! Or we\u2019re gonna go to the next thing \u2014 1024! And anybody that ever studied computer science knows: We start with 16, go to 32, go to 64, go to 128, 256, 512, 1024, and so on and so forth \u2014 and the numbers get pretty fricking big! And then when they get done with that they flip to the next protocol, the next protocol! [16:16] Who do you think is gonna figure that out? The people that have $500 Billion of risk to figure it out? Or someone that\u2019s got no money at all but thinks they might just want to solve the problem just so they can crack the world? And it\u2019s like, Yeah, maybe! But it\u2019s just as likely that some dude\u2019s gonna come up with a revolver that shoots like photon bullets and they\u2019re going to crash the United States government because they\u2019re the first dude with a photon bullet revolver. It\u2019s an interesting idea \u2014 I\u2019m a lot more persuaded if the Pentagon with their hundreds of billions of dollars is gonna come up with a photon bullet gun or the laser rifle or the whatever. So the entire network is channeling innovation. You come up with better hardware? It\u2019s gonna go into the miners. You come up with better client software? It\u2019s gonna go into the wallets. You come up with a better software, or a way to write software? Don\u2019t you think people in the Bitcoin Core community are gonna use that way to write better software? And if it\u2019s too dangerous, the community is gonna slow it down \u2014 otherwise, if there\u2019s a political threat, everybody that\u2019s adopted Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset has a vested interest in dealing with the political threat. And if they can\u2019t deal with it \u2014 if you are a creature with two arms and I wrap a tourniquet around one of your arms and I choke off the blood flow, the arm dies \u2014 use the other arm! When you\u2019re an octopus, you\u2019ve got eight. When you\u2019re a hydra, you\u2019ve got a million. So the entire creature\u2019s just going to move to a place where there is oxygen where it can live. And if it can fight, it will fight. And if it can\u2019t fight, it will morph itself into a different domain, and unless you figure out a way to kill it everywhere at the same time \u2014 utterly, down to the last node \u2014 you\u2019re probably not gonna kill it. And it seems to me that nobody\u2019s really got a vested interest in doing that and if they did it\u2019s just not clear. Pick one government \u2014 one government attacks it, it becomes more useful to every other government. And they all can\u2019t agree on anything, ever. And even if they could agree on anything, ever, they still can\u2019t do it, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [18:58]: Yeah! I love the quote from Philip II of Macedon about the road being wide enough for a donkey with a pot of gold. That relates to me to the famous quote from Charlie Munger: Show me the incentive and I\u2019ll show you the outcome. And I think that is one of the key aspects of Bitcoin is that, even if you have this breakthrough \u2014 quantum computer, whatever it is \u2014 you\u2019re still incentivized to contribute that innovation to the network. That is the most lucrative, most energy-efficient strategy possible, even in that breakthrough environment. And to your point about cryptography \u2014 it\u2019s always been a cat and mouse game. It\u2019s always been kind of the defense, someone trying to crack it, and then the defense adapts. To your point it\u2019s a dynamic defense, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s ongoing. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so relevant. And when you look at it through that lens, the most brilliant aspect of Bitcoin is that incentive schema, frankly \u2014 you\u2019re always incentivized to contribute to its longevity. Which seems to make it antifragile, to your point."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [20:06]: The one thing in the Bitcoin ethos is they hate gatekeepers. So gatekeeper is a very powerful metaphor: The reason that the Great Wall of China fell was because there were gates and there were gatekeepers. And the prosperity of 100 Million people could be destroyed by corrupting the one on the gate. As soon as the one gatekeeper opens the gate, the 100,000 person army comes through. And herein you see the problem with hiding behind a wall, or hiding behind a wall with a gate in it. A much better idea would be: I have my own 100,000 person army and when that army comes I stand against them. And that\u2019s what the Romans knew. The Romans never sat and cowered behind a gate, they knew \u2014 and anybody in a war knows \u2014 you have to go and leave the citadel and you have to actively fight the army that would kill you, because if they manage to surround you and isolate you, no amount of defense is going to hold [them] back. They will find a way through, and that\u2019s the story of history. Gatekeepers are your weakness! There\u2019s no gatekeepers in Bitcoin, and there\u2019s no gatekeepers in a decentralized proof of work network that\u2019s energy-intensive. That\u2019s one of the problems I think of like proof of stake networks or the \u2014 every time someone tries to come up with a \u201cmore efficient way to do it\u201d, well if you\u2019re going to secure a $1 Trillion network with $1 Billion of stuff staked, the problem with that is all I need is another $1 Billion to bribe that person. Or half a billion! Half a billion bribes half that network and then I topple the entire trillion and I get it all, right? So when you have anything where I\u2019m playing games where I\u2019m trying to use a small amount of energy \u2014 and money is energy, right? \u2014 a small amount of money, a small amount of energy. If you\u2019re trying to use a small amount of energy to secure a large amount of energy, you created a gatekeeper! And so you need to flip the pyramid, and that\u2019s why there\u2019s no shortcuts here: There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch. And it doesn\u2019t terribly bother me that Bitcoin channels a lot of energy. By the way \u2014 through encryption facilities! A miner is an encryption facility, it\u2019s generating SHA-256 hashes and you\u2019re gonna have to get through that hash wall, and the only way you\u2019re gonna get through it is you\u2019re gonna have to buy yourself 51% of all of that equipment on Earth, and then you\u2019re gonna have to harness 51% of all the energy, and then you\u2019re gonna have to attack and it still may not work!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [23:07]: And you\u2019re still incentivized to honesty, even if you\u2019re executing a 51% attack."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: And the joke of course is, If you really could buy 51% of the encryption equipment and harness 51% of the energy, you could have 51% of the block rewards and 51% of the transaction fees, and the value of owning half of the transaction fees is higher! When the thing\u2019s worth $10 Trillion and the transaction fees are 1%, there\u2019s gonna be $100 Billion worth a year worth of transaction fees, so it\u2019s $51 Billion a year. If you cap that at 20x, it\u2019s $1 Trillion just to go along with the program! So someone\u2019s gonna have to have $100 Trillion and be really mad in order to want to spend $1 Trillion to destroy other people \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Plus, you\u2019re not gonna get to attack the thing without a counterattack, right? Because at the point that you have 100 Million people that all have all of their life\u2019s energy \u2014 all of their hopes, their aspirations and all of their economic security and physical security invested in the network \u2014 they\u2019re probably not gonna roll over and let you do it. It\u2019s pretty hard for one evil genius by themself to plot a trillion-dollar war on a cyber network. How are you gonna gather the software and the hardware and the monetary energy and the political support by yourself? And if you\u2019re not by yourself, I\u2019m reminded of the phrase, Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead. [24:56] So when I think about Bitcoin I think, It\u2019s harder, but it\u2019s harder because it\u2019s an evolving herd creature, an evolving swarm creature. And it\u2019s evolving as fast as it can, and it feels pain. As Nicholas Taleb says in Antifragile, Pain is a good thing! You can tell the difference between people that get it and people that don\u2019t get it. There\u2019s a group of people in life that run from pain, and they\u2019re attempting to anesthesize themselves and always isolate themselves from pain. And there\u2019s a group of people that run toward pain, or at least they embrace pain. Pain\u2019s a good thing! The more pain you feel, the faster your reflexes. Put your hand on a hot stove, it moves quickly \u2014 you have reflexes. So that system is learning and pain is one of our number one information signals \u2014 maybe the most important information signal, in order to provide a living organism with vitality.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [26:10]: That\u2019s right! Yeah Taleb says that, Stressors and pain are indistinguishable from information at the organic level. That it\u2019s the only way that an organic system learns is by exposure to something that is resistive or conflictive to it. And even at a genetic level, when a virus invades a host organism and destroys its cells, there\u2019s always a few cells that survive. And those cells that survive actually take some of the DNA from the virus that wiped out 99% of their cellular comrades and incorporates that DNA into its own such that it is resistant now to that virus. So it\u2019s happening at an informational level even deep in biology. This isn\u2019t just something that happens kind of at the physical layer here. It happens really \u2014 it\u2019s quintessential to life, is I guess the point I\u2019m getting at."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [27:10]: I agree. And I think that if it\u2019s not a living thing, it can\u2019t be hard, it can\u2019t be hardest! People think gold is the hardest thing because it\u2019s a rock, but it really isn\u2019t the hardest thing. The hardest thing is like the Mongolian horde if you\u2019re in its way. When the horde with 100,000 comes at you and they\u2019re terrorizing, blood-curdling with their missiles \u2014 and if you read the history of Genghis Khan, they would ride across the plain, they\u2019d find a city, the city is surrounded by a moat, they would go upriver and divert the river, they would divert the river, choke the city, starve them of water for three days, and they\u2019d ride underneath the gates in the riverbed. It\u2019s just horrifying, blood-curdling, living horde creature. And you want to attack it? It\u2019s moving. You could go to it, retreat, they stop, they turn around, they throw you off balance, they murder you. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re dealing with living creatures. Go into a hornets nest, attack the hornets with your revolver \u2014 see what happens. The most horrifying thing, right? You have 1,000 hornets \u2014 you see these videos of 20 hornets taking apart 20,000 bees?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Yeah I saw that on Twitter recently!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [28:41]: Frightening! Frightening. And they\u2019re all examples of that. There\u2019s bacterial examples, there are cancer examples, there are single-celled organism examples, there\u2019s invertebrate examples. When something is a decentralized, organic creature that is rapidly evolving and adapting, it becomes excessively antifragile, because every time you kill it or kill an element of it, the elements you don\u2019t kill get that much stronger.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: I\u2019m reminded of a quote too when you\u2019re talking about the possibility of Bitcoin being disrupted or attacked from the outside, that you are attacking the life energy of the HODLers, if money is energy. And there\u2019s a Sun Tzu quote from the Art of War and it said that \u2014 I\u2019ll paraphrase \u2014 but basically you never want to attack an enemy whose back is against the wall. They have nothing to lose. Therefore they will come at you with everything they\u2019ve got. It\u2019s almost just an unstoppable force. And it seems to me that\u2019s what you\u2019re facing when you face Bitcoin. You\u2019re facing this swarm intelligence of individually self-interested but collectively organized life force that\u2019s defending their own life energy. So it seems just really hard to attack that. Almost as if you\u2019re attacking the honey in the wasp nest \u2014 they\u2019re gonna come at you with everything they\u2019ve got."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [36:09]: In 5,000 years! In 5 Billion years! Gold\u2019s pretty much 5 Billion years \u2014 God made it, and left it that way. And there\u2019s a lesson to be learned from that, but the point is: it\u2019s not upgrading, it\u2019s not going to move. And if it doesn\u2019t move, invariably when human beings come in conflict with mountains, we move the mountains! We move the rivers, we chop up the granite. Go look at a citadel, it\u2019s literally moved the mountain. You might have to move it 2 tons at a time. Look at the pyramids. 5,000 years ago someone figured out how to move a mountain of rock. And that\u2019s 5,000\u20144,000 years ago! Are you gonna bet against 100,000 humans with their channeling gravity, channeling water, channeling whatever? Or are you gonna bet on the mountain? And the answer is: you\u2019re gonna bet on the human beings! When you roll forward and you look at human beings versus animals, it\u2019s the same thing: us versus elephants, us versus lions, us versus nature \u2014 anything living. Generally we figure out how to beat it because we channel energy better! So now we\u2019re talking about, What are we competing with here? Well, if we\u2019re competing with gold it just seems like no contest whatsoever! Let\u2019s talk about smarter, stronger, and faster. Because harder is relevant to money, but smarter, stronger, and faster is the source of all tech value in the past 20 years \u2014 maybe in the past 2,000 years. Let\u2019s talk about smarter. Well if Bitcoin is programmable money \u2014 it\u2019s a pure energy token and I can move it around \u2014 that means that I can write software on the clients and I can software on the server that will actually move the money. And that means you can hold keys to 100 Bitcoin and then you can write software that will prove that you\u2019re credit-worthy, that you own the keys to 100 Bitcoin. Then you can actually use it to register and certify a transaction or information or a title channeled into that. I can write a piece of software that will \u2014 what do I want? What if a million people wanted to borrow money pledging Bitcoin? And what if another million people wanted to loan out money and generate interest? And what if I write a program where everybody on one side says, I\u2019ll pay 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8% interest, and everybody on the other side says, I\u2019ll make a loan assuming a collateral coverage of 4:1 in Bitcoin and I can mark it to market every hour. Okay? You\u2019re offering me terms, you\u2019re offering the loan, I\u2019m offering to borrow, we create a piece of software, it runs every day, every minute, every second. Robert, what if you had 10 Bitcoin and I scanned everybody \u2014 100 Million people \u2014 what if I scanned them today and I found someone willing to pay you 8% interest with a loan to value of 10% and you could mark it to market every minute? Good deal? Maybe! Maybe a good deal! Maybe you wouldn\u2019t be willing to loan it, but if you did \u2014 what if I went through all 100 Million of \u2019em and I found someone that needed the money real bad and would pay you 27% interest? Smart. Smart? What if I actually ran the algorithm every hour? What if I ran the algorithm every second? What if someone wants to borrow the money for a year and they\u2019ll pay you 10%? And what if they want to borrow for 30 years and they\u2019ll pay you 15%? What if they want to borrow for 1 year and they\u2019ll pay you 5%? What if they want to pay you overnight and they\u2019ll pay you x%? You could generate the yield curve with a piece of software, and then that software will connect all of the lenders with all of the borrowers on a server. It could be a centralized server. The logic doesn\u2019t have to be decentralized. In fact a centralized server runs a billion times faster than a proof of work network, so it\u2019s likely that the logic will be smart, and that\u2019s an idea. Another idea is: put the intelligence on your iPhone and be able to talk to your iPhone and when I talk to my iPhone I can tell it to chop my money into 37 pieces and send it off \u2014 Send my money to my daughter and let her spend it on ice cream but not on Uber rides because I don\u2019t want her running off with her boyfriend somewhere. So I can condition the money using all manner of software, and I can turn on servers that will move my money around while I\u2019m sleeping, and I can turn on clients that will handle my money. And of course, if I walked into your bedroom and I picked up a gold bar and I walked out with it, the bar\u2019s not gonna complain \u2014 it\u2019s a dumb rock! On the other hand, if I took your Bitcoin and I wrapped your multi-factor authentication around it and your retina scan and your voice scan, I could geofence it and I could say, Nobody can move a mobile device with this Bitcoin key outside 100 meters of where Robert lives. You could do all sorts of magical crazy things with software that you can\u2019t do in mechanics \u2014 machines. So gold is in essence mechanical, and Bitcoin is virtual. And of course, it\u2019s tokenized, and that means it can get as smart as the computer can get smart, and eventually the computers can talk to other computers and that opens up all sorts of applications like credit ratings, authenticity, insurance. Maybe I want to buy insurance for you but I want you to pledge the full value of my house and I want to know that you have the proof of the reserves to pay off the insurance, right? So you can create very interesting pieces of software with less risk or more transparency and more speed. We know it doesn\u2019t work with gold. It doesn\u2019t work with tokenized gold, because you\u2019ve got the counterparty risk and you don\u2019t know whether the tokens actually are backed by real gold. It doesn\u2019t really work with other tokenized assets because stocks, bonds\u2014they move too slow \u2014 and there\u2019s no API between the bonds and the tokens and if there was an API you end up with regulatory compliance issues and you\u2019re not delivering the physical instrument, ever. So that\u2019s just not likely to happen.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [43:42]: It seems to me the general theme is we\u2019re betting on dynamism over the static state.

It\u2019s not adapting, it\u2019s not changing. I wonder if \u2014 so today, to kind of change the lanes a little bit, the US Treasury is considered the risk-free rate in the world, being that it bears low to no interest, but it [presumably] has no risk of default, or the lowest risk of default. As you see us moving into more of a Bitcoin-denominated world, there have been talks of a risk-free rate for Bitcoin developing on the Lightning Network, such that you would fund these Lightning channels in time-locked contracts that the market would determine \u2014 anywhere from a minute to 30 years \u2014 and it would bear some interest rate. Do you think that\u2019s the direction the risk-free rate goes? Is that how we develop a Bitcoin yield curve? Or how do you see that evolving?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [06:10]: We\u2019re talking about Bitcoin as the first digital monetary network! I\u2019m positing this thought experiment: I have a $100 Million block of energy. I can generate $100 Million worth of energy through chemical processes, kinetic, gravitational, electrical, atomic power. Let\u2019s just assume that I did some amount of work in order to generate that energy. I converted that energy into money. Money is the highest form of energy! Now I\u2019ve got $100 Million block of money! You can do a lot with $100 Million! It equates to about 3,000 lbs worth of gold, it converts to $100 Million of currency, and we could do the calculation in Bitcoin \u2014 a little bit less than 10,000 Bitcoin at this point in time. Now, I want to do two things with it: I want to channel it through time, and I want to channel it through space. The beauty of Bitcoin channeling through time is that there really is no loss over time, there\u2019s no inflation. You\u2019ve only got the 21 Million Bitcoin, so as a ratio to 21 Million it\u2019s infinitely hard! And so that\u2019s a big check, and if we contrast it to gold and fiat: you\u2019re gonna lose 99.5% of your energy in fiat. You\u2019re gonna lose 98% of your energy in gold. You\u2019re gonna keep all your energy in Bitcoin! So clearly, channeling energy through time is important and it\u2019s critical. Channeling it through space really refers not just to moving it around the world, but it means moving it across domains at well from counterparty to counterparty. We can see the inefficiencies in fiat counterparty to counterparty is: you\u2019re locked into 9-to-5 banking hours, you can\u2019t do big transactions on a Saturday, there are certain jurisdictions where you can\u2019t do transactions at all, you\u2019re always working through a counterparty which is its own risk. And of course if we go to gold, fiat is faster, but it\u2019s still got complexities. Gold is slower \u2014 it\u2019s gonna take a month to physically deliver gold, and so: super slow, super expensive. Neither fiat nor gold make nearly so much sense for channeling energy through time and space! I think that the best metaphor when I think about this is it\u2019s like I want to cross from London to New York City and I need to cross the Atlantic \u2014 and that\u2019s the journey. And if I\u2019m gonna do it with fiat currency it\u2019s like a big rubber raft with a leak in it, and I\u2019m gonna be continually blowing up that raft every day to keep it from sinking on me! And I\u2019m going to get battered this way and that way, and it\u2019s a bit of a venture! On the other hand with gold, it\u2019s like getting in a wooden ship. And it\u2019s gonna rot over the course of many many years, but maybe for the first 2, 3, 4, 5, years \u2014 compared to the rubber raft \u2014 I feel pretty good! But it\u2019s a heavy ship! Wood is heavier than rubber, so it\u2019s kind of harder to get going and it\u2019s harder to maneuver it but it\u2019s a bit more solid. But ultimately it\u2019s organic and it\u2019s going to decay! And then if I put it into a crypto container \u2014 a Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s like a steel vessel. I have a steel hull \u2014 a steel hull container ship really, is the best metaphor \u2014 1,000 feet long, 60 feet wide, moves 30 knots! The thing that\u2019s special about steel is: steel is indestructible as long as you maintain it! The maintenance means: you have to keep it from corroding! It can be attacked by a corrosion, and the way you maintain it is you paint it. You sand it down every 5\u201310 years, you repaint it. If you maintain it, it will last longer than you will last! In fact it will last essentially forever \u2014 hundreds of years! If you punch a hole in a steel hull and then you weld it, the weld is stronger than the original steel. So it is the indestructible, extremely strong, repairable element. And it doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if you\u2019re going to actually engage in commerce all around the world, you want a bunch of steel container ships! You do not want wooden ships, and you certainly don\u2019t want inflatables! And that\u2019s the distinction and that\u2019s why Bitcoin is really such an extraordinary invention! We talked about getting out of the gravity well \u2014 the other metaphor is: I have $100 Million worth of energy. If I can get it into a vacuum and vacuum seal it\u2014it\u2019s like when we want to keep food forever we vacuum seal the food\u2014we want to keep bacteria from attacking it. We want to keep natural parasites and pathogens from attacking our food energy! And so the way that you protect your food energy and stabilize it forever is you vacuum seal it! And the way you protect your monetary energy from parasites and from decay and from rotting is you vacuum seal it! And that is the genius of Bitcoin! When I say that the destiny is to be encrypted, it\u2019s like vacuum sealing your food. You\u2019re taking monetary energy in fiat that can decay, debase, diffuse, and you\u2019re encrypting it in an encrypted container such that no one else can touch it, no one else can screw with it. And when you think about all these miners, these miners are power plants, they\u2019re plugged into analog energy, but they\u2019re modulating the analog, physical, pure energy through the SHA-256 protocol to make it a wall of encrypted energy, if not a cloud of encrypted energy and the rails of encrypted energy! If you want to pass through that, if you want to attack that, you have to go through that wall of SHA-256 encrypted energy! And all of our monetary energy is protected and floating in the cloud behind that wall! And it\u2019s a fairly unique wall. And that\u2019s the majesty of Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [13:55]: Right! Already the most powerful computing network in the world!

They\u2019re HODLing! And they figured it out before I figured it out! And I give them credit: they figured it out and that\u2019s genius! But I\u2019m not too proud to learn.

Could I borrow some of that fire, Sir? And thank you! Thank you, for bringing life to me! So, adoption: the number of individuals and the number of entities that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset \u2014 not measured in numbers, measured in monetary energy in whatever US dollar equivalents, but they\u2019re converting their fiat (Euros, Yen, Pesos, Dollars) \u2014 the total US dollar amount of fiat that is converted into Bitcoin for the purposes of holding as a treasury reserve asset! You see that the traders, the speculators \u2014 they\u2019re short term interesting, but over the long term they don\u2019t really have any value to the network, right? Someone that\u2019s going to buy $1 Million of Bitcoin today and sell it tomorrow? They\u2019re not going to drive network energy, because they\u2019re going to rob the network of energy as fast as they fed the network. They are mercenaries! The Roman Empire was built on citizen soldiers willing to fight and die to protect what they believed in! At the point that you\u2019re hiring mercenaries to fight and not die as long as you pay them \u2014 your empire\u2019s over! So, the HODLers \u2014 people that adopt Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset \u2014 they\u2019re citizens of Bitcoin! They\u2019re citizens of the network! And if you decide it\u2019s 20% of your treasury reserves \u2014 like, it\u2019s a matter of faith! How committed are you? If you really committed like, say, Microstrategy \u2014 I had $500 Million worth of money I didn\u2019t need! I had two choices: I can buy the stock back or buy Bitcoin with it. Well I bought as much stock back as the shareholders wanted to sell to us, because that was the appropriate, respectful thing to do \u2014 to put a tender offer! And then whatever\u2019s left, we convert! The treasury is our reserve asset, which is our reserve energy! It is our life force! Treasury is life force! It\u2019s not unlike fat. Fat is nature\u2019s organic battery. You carry 30 lbs of fat, that means you\u2019ll probably be able to live an extra 60\u201390 days without food when the going gets tough! And so it\u2019s an organic battery. A treasury is an organic battery. Or it\u2019s a monetary battery for a family, an individual, a company, or a country! You have no treasury?

Whatever you\u2019re holding it in is basically an insurance policy on the uncertainty of the future! Because this cash balance or this treasury reserve gives you pure optionality in the marketplace, you\u2019re best able to contend with unforeseen developments! Another thing, just to jump back to the power and money relationship, I think it\u2019s very interesting to look at power through the physics definition. Physics defines power as work over time! That\u2019s what gold was: it was reflective of our collective work over time, and it was a claim on that work over time in the form of capital! And the other thing\u2014you were drawing the analogy to the vacuum sealing to protect it from parasites \u2014 I think we could all agree that work is kind of the opposite of theft, right? You don\u2019t create any value by theft, you just steal the value of others\u2019 work. And that\u2019s essentially what inflation is! So, money being power, there\u2019s a big incentive to store it in a medium that is as much protected from theft as possible!

If you were sober I pay the policy, unless someone says that you were erratic and I don\u2019t pay the policy! And so that\u2019s the problem with buying an insurance policy! If I have $100 Million of energy and I buy a $1 Million insurance policy that pays off $100 Million\u2014if it pays off! Well that\u2019s cheap! And I get to take the $99 Million and buy something else with it, but I\u2019ve assumed risk \u2014 I\u2019ve taken on counterparty risk in order to get the insurance policy. You could say that $100 Million of Bitcoin in your treasury is an insurance with no counterparty risk!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [28:27]: This I think brings up a very deep point! I actually Tweeted about this today. There\u2019s a quote from Carl Schmitt that says, \u201cHe who gets to decide the exception is sovereign.\u201d So there\u2019s rules they\u2019re all abiding by \u2014 or protocols \u2014 but whoever gets to make exceptions to those rules or protocols really has the power to act as they see fit in the world because they get to bend the rules! And that\u2019s what is so deeply profound about Bitcoin is that it is a set of rules that we cannot break! It is an exception-proof money supply! And it\u2019s unlike anything we\u2019ve ever had! And by eliminating that attack vector such that any group could be sovereign over the money, it effectively makes everyone individually maximally sovereign! And that\u2019s one of the great breakthroughs of Bitcoin!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [33:55]: Individuals do it too, right? Corporations do it and individuals do it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Absolutely, and I think you\u2019re plucking the thread of how the incentive schema related to fiat currency fragilizes the economy in a systemic fashion! To your point, there\u2019s no adequate store of value, so people at the individual and corporate level are forced into the use of leverage! The assumption of debt! Because the real debt load is actually eroding via inflation over time, so there\u2019s an incentive to take on debt. But this is a very short-sighted strategy, because now you are hyper-exposed to the inherent volatility of the future! So once there\u2019s any form of shock\u2014COVID or any other form of economic shock \u2014 you can go to zero immediately! You get wiped out! Versus holding cash \u2014 makes you antifragile! You can absorb these shocks! You can actually capitalize on these shocks, such that if things get priced lower in the market, you can go and acquire things at a discount!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [34:57]: And in a simple world, if you had cash that was non-inflationary, if the politicians adopted Austrian economics and said we\u2019re gonna print cash with zero inflation, then it\u2019s simple for the citizens of the society to save in cash, and you have deflation! And the cash will actually be worth more over time! And that\u2019s what Jeff Booth points out. But every technologist knows this! If there was no inflation, the cash would buy more over time, and my entire simple monetary strategy would be: save cash and over time I\u2019ll improve. But in a currency war, the political system declares war on the currency and makes the cash toxic! And if it\u2019s 2% toxic, that\u2019s like injecting a mild drug into your veins. When it becomes 10% toxic, it\u2019s like a poison in your veins. When it becomes 20% toxic, this is like basically saying I\u2019m gonna put a healthy on chemotherapy, and I pump toxic chemicals through a healthy person\u2019s bloodstream, because current \u2014 current is like blood current \u2014 it\u2019s carrying the energy of life, the oxygen. Oxygen is energy. Your blood carries energy to keep you alive \u2014 currency is carrying energy! If a sovereign nation is injecting massive inflation into its own currency, it\u2019s injecting a toxicity into its own circulatory system, and it\u2019s somewhere between either \u2014 one metaphor is chemotherapy \u2014 another metaphor would be Type 2 Diabetes. I\u2019m injecting so much sugar into your system that your insulin response is failing and you\u2019re becoming insulin-resistant, and your body becomes diabetic and I give you metabolic disease because I am just pumping the liquidity too hard into the currency, which is the blood of life!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Which is possibly where we are today, right? The stimulative responses by the central banks don\u2019t seem to be having the same effects as they used to!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [37:34]: Yeah arguably like, if I pump enough sugar into your body, you could become diabetic first, and then the pancreas fails and the liver fails, and you have organ failure, cancer, and death! That\u2019s what happens if you overdose on pure sugar. I guess the equivalent would be hyperinflation. If I inject enough money in the system that the currency loses all of its energy carrying\u2014like oxygen carrying capability? \u2014 energy carrying capability! I just lose it all! At that point the organ failure is, Now how do I buy electricity? How do I buy food? How do I get on a bus? Like all the transit systems, the food systems \u2014 how do I pay soldiers and policemen and firemen? That\u2019s organ death of the society. That happens at hyper-hyperinflation!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [38:27]: That\u2019s a great point! You said it loses its energy carrying capacity. And it\u2019s also \u2014 there\u2019s a connection here to information, because the price signals become totally disrupted! The money means nothing in that instance! So capital is not being allocated efficiently whatsoever, because prices are completely \u2014 you completely lose this economic nerve signal that we call the price signal. So it\u2019s losing its energy carrying capacity, its information carrying capacity, and you end up with cash in the streets like we have in Venezuela today!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [38:58]: The phrase, Toxic shock, comes to mind! Toxic shock! The toxic shock of the system. But, let\u2019s move back to our happy subject! How does the Bitcoin energy network grow? Well, adoption! So a million people adopt it as their 90% treasury reserve asset and they have $1 Million each, and now you\u2019ve got $1 Million times a thousand is a billion, a million times a million is a trillion, right? So a million millions gets you to a trillion in the network, they put the money in the network and the network is the syndication of all of the treasury energy of the people that choose to adopt it as their primary treasury reserve. So when a million people put a million dollars in it\u2019s a trillion dollar network. When a thousand companies put a billion dollars in, it\u2019s another trillion dollar network, so now you\u2019re up to $2 Trillion! When a hundred companies put a billion in or $100 Billion in \u2014 you go the next level! So as individuals, families, private companies, public companies, government agencies, small governments, municipalities, states, small countries, mid-size countries, big countries, all the non-profit organizations \u2014 as they adopt this as their treasury reserve asset, they don\u2019t need to adopt it as their currency, medium of exchange! They don\u2019t need to adopt it as their unit of measure! As it becomes their store of value, their treasury reserve asset, as they adopt it, the network syndicates all their energy, and the decision of Apple to buy $100 Billion worth of it would accrue to the benefit of a million HODLers that bought $100,000 each or $1 Million each or $50,000 or whatever they bought! The beauty of it is that everybody is pro rata, pari passu benefiting. And it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to bring everybody else in, right? And it\u2019s a network effect, that as someone comes in, someone else comes in, the price moves up, the people that were in it get a benefit, and now we get to this next dynamic \u2014 with me pausing to say: without adoption, without people believing that this should be their treasury reserve asset, without that, you have nothing! So it\u2019s not enough to say it\u2019s just hard! People have to love Bitcoin more than they love gold, silver, Apple stock, Amazon, Facebook \u2014 whatever! By the way, we didn\u2019t touch on it much, but if we consider Bitcoin as an energy network versus Facebook or Apple as an energy network, the issue there is: I gotta look out 100 years and say, Will I be able to put $100 Million in Apple stock, hold it for 100 years \u2014 and what\u2019s my exposure? And of course your exposure is: income tax on the company, sales tax on their product, tariff exchanges, regulatory interaction, income tax on their employees, all sorts of other taxes you can come up with, plus many other regulatory actions including and likely being the ultimate regulation of these things as public utilities, because if they weren\u2019t regulated as public utilities, the richest guy in every city would be the guy that owns the electrical power plant! And that guy would be richer than Jeff Bezos or Bill Gates or anything! The only reason that these guys are rich is because they\u2019re in a new novel unregulated area that was not deemed to be important! And the problem is, as soon as it is deemed to be important enough that you can\u2019t live without it, then it becomes a God-given right to have access to your YouTube or to your iPhone or to your whatever, and now the entire value proposition differs! I mean we live in a society right now where people think equity is the perfect store of value! What they don\u2019t realize is: it\u2019s possible for the equity to go to zero! For example, a nationalized power station has zero equity! It still works! When stuff gets nationalized, be it education, power, electricity, technology \u2014 the equity goes to zero! You can have something with an equity zero and the debt has value. You can have something where the equity has no value, the debt has no value, but the underlying vendors are getting paid. It can shift back and forth \u2014 it\u2019s a political thing! So with regard to Bitcoin and the value of the network, it comes down to people making the commitment to adopt it as their treasury reserve asset at all levels. It\u2019s just as good for us if Norway adopts it for their treasury reserve as it is some big charity as it is the Rockefeller Foundation or the Hughes Institute or Harvard or Stanford or MIT or for a private company or a public company or an agency of the government. Maybe the county or a city that you live in or the fire department or a union or a pension fund! And then there\u2019s all the investors, right? Hedge funds, pensions funds, insurance companies! There are a lot of entities that have monetary energy. They either need it to operate or they stored it up in trust for their shareholders or for future generations, etc. So as that energy flows, the network strengthens! Now that\u2019s the first order dynamic. It\u2019s simple network effect. We\u2019re syndicating our power. No different than \u2014 let\u2019s say that there are a hundred of us in a football field, and you organize 50 people to be on your tug-of-war team, and I can only get 5 on mine, and the rest are all singletons \u2014 your team wins! If there\u2019s a lesson of history, the lesson of history is: the most organized team always wins! Usually the Romans kicked everybody\u2019s ass for nearly a thousand years! Because they were the most organized! When they put their petty differences aside for 700 years, they beat everybody else. And then when they started fighting with each other there\u2019s the decay and eventually when they were disorganized, that disorganization causes a deterioration in power. So it\u2019s the most organized that wins. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in 8th grade football or whether you\u2019re in high school or in college. Whatever it is! Organization is always critical!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: And I think you\u2019re pointing to another strength of the Bitcoin network here! And also debunking what I would call the alternative narrative that money needs to be adopted as a medium of exchange to proliferate as a network. You do have to HODL or adopt it as a treasury reserve asset\u2014in an economic sense \u2014 to create reservation demand for that asset. You\u2019re taking that asset off the market. You\u2019re reducing its supply, thereby increasing its price. And that\u2019s what creates the bootstrapping effect, this monetization process. And that again hearkens back to this evolutionary path where you have it as a store of value first. After it\u2019s created enough value, it can be used as a medium of exchange, because those early HODLers had more of an incentive to use it as a medium of exchange. And then finally when its been widely accepted enough, it\u2019s being used as a unit of account. To your point about organization, HODLers are all perfectly aligned to 21 Million! It\u2019s just the energy efficient strategy is to just HODL! It\u2019s very simple, hard to disrupt, hard to disorganize because there\u2019s not a lot of activity on the part of the HODLer, so it seems like an indomitable strategy in the market for money!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [47:59]: That\u2019s why, if you understood Bitcoin, you would never say something so silly as, I know when to buy it and I know when to sell it and I just trade! The people that are trading in it don\u2019t really understand it, because if they understood it they would just buy it and HODL it! And sometimes people think they\u2019re accomplishing something, but they\u2019re accomplishing not that much! If a hundred entities buy $1 Billion each, then the value of the network\u2019s gonna go up by more than $100 Billion, and if they just buy it and park it in a cyber-vault and don\u2019t touch it for 100 years, it doesn\u2019t matter! It\u2019s going up! The fact that they poured their energy into the container is actually what caused the energy network to grow! The moving in and out is actually wasting and dissipating energy! You\u2019re just dissipating energy to come and go, and ultimately the success of the thing \u2014 I hear these people, they talk about store of value, medium of exchange. Well, Bitcoin is the high frequency store of value and a low frequency medium of exchange! That\u2019s what it needs to be and technically that\u2019s what it is! And if you understand that, once you get it, you realize you shouldn\u2019t fight that! So for example: I buy $1 Billion of Bitcoin. Every second, it keeps anybody from stealing my Bitcoin! Every second, it\u2019s storing the value! No government, no parasite, no thief, no hacker is taking my billion dollars every second for the next million years! It\u2019s working! In the same way that I put that energy into a vacuum package and every second it\u2019s staying vacuum sealed, and the whole point was to live forever! And so if I gave you a little crypto-field that made you live forever and never age, you would say, High frequency longevity device \u2014 it works pretty well! And you wouldn\u2019t have a problem \u2014 there\u2019s nothing wrong with living forever! It\u2019s immortal energy! So that\u2019s high frequency. The problem is, people don\u2019t recognize that every second of the day they\u2019re being attacked. You are being attacked! Every second of the day there\u2019s bacteria and there\u2019s viruses trying to kill you! If I said, I\u2019m gonna spin up a field that stops them from killing you, it\u2019s gonna work a million years, and you\u2019re not gonna notice it \u2014 you would think that\u2019s a pretty good trick! But that is in fact what happens when you actually store value! Now, low frequency medium of exchange: in order for Bitcoin to have its antifragile properties and utility, we have to be able to move it on occasion. Maybe once a year I move it from one cyber crypto bank to another one, or one cyber vault to another one, or once a decade. Or maybe when I\u2019m gonna die I need to transfer it to somebody or split it between my daughter and my son. Or maybe not, maybe I just have one key and I give it to my one child. They give it to their one child, they give it to their one child \u2014 then it never gets transferred! Maybe once a year I have to take 5% of my Bitcoin out of my vault, convert it to fiat, and then break that into 100,000 little parts and put it on Apple Pay and use it to pay for Ubers and Domino\u2019s Pizza and credit card bills. Okay! Once a year I take a chunk out of my piggy bank, my crypto bank, and I put it into fiat, and I do whatever I\u2019m gonna do with it \u2014 maybe! And maybe\u2014if the world works the way you\u2019d think it might work\u2014I just put $100 Million into the vault, I never take it out, I just borrow against it! I just borrow $3 Million a year, $1 Million a year \u2014 tax free! I don\u2019t recognize income, I don\u2019t generate a capital gain tax, I don\u2019t generate an operating income tax. If I borrow money in cash and if my Bitcoin is going up 20% a year \u2014 that\u2019s the real yield\u2014and I can borrow money at 5%, then my effective arbitrage is 15%! So it never makes sense to sell it, ever! In fact, if you look at people that use real estate as a store of value, the way it works is, My family buys a block in Manhattan for $10 Million in 1900. It goes up 8% a year\u2014it doubles every 10 years. It\u2019s worth $20 Million, then $40 Million, then $80 Million, and then $160 Million, and by the time you get out 80 years, you got a billion dollars worth of real estate in Manhattan. You\u2019re not selling it! You haven\u2019t done one transaction in a hundred years! All you\u2019ve done is pledged it as collateral against the loan and you\u2019ve borrowed $42 Million against it and you\u2019re paying 3% interest. And that $42 Million \u2014 that\u2019s not income! You didn\u2019t pay 42% tax on $42 Million \u2014 that\u2019s not income! That\u2019s not a capital gain! It\u2019s not a long term capital gain! It\u2019s not a short term capital gain! It\u2019s a liability! You\u2019ve generated $42 Million of liabilities against a non-taxed asset. The only way it\u2019s getting taxed is you\u2019re just suffering from real estate taxes, right? But, if you\u2019re in a jurisdiction where inflation is high, real estate tax is low, interest is low, then your secret to living well forever tax-free is just borrow against your stationary assets! And so that\u2019s the news of this week: Donald Trump has $400 Million in debt and paid no taxes for a decade. But he\u2019s not unique! You could substitute every real estate magnate, a family that had generational wealth in real estate, they all did it! All of \u2018em! How do rich people live well and pay no taxes? Not by selling stuff! Not by transacting stuff! The way that they actually live is they just park an asset on the balance sheet, and they never ever ever ever trade it! They just finance it or borrow against it \u2014 and once in a blue moon, once in a decade, somebody wants to pay me triple what it\u2019s worth \u2014 and maybe I do it, but oftentimes, the Warren Buffett school of thought is, The taxes kill you! And so the ideal holding period for an asset is forever! He says it\u2019s forever like I\u2019m committed to it \u2014 yeah! But it\u2019s the taxes that murder you, and so the ideal holding period is forever because then you can pledge it and borrow against it. How do you get rich? You buy an asset, it goes up, you borrow against it to buy another asset, and it goes up, you borrow against it, you buy another asset, and it goes up, and pretty soon you\u2019ve generated all these assets that are highly appreciated with massive built-in capital gains that you\u2019re never ever gonna recognize! Obviously that can change in different types of jurisdictions where politicians decide they\u2019re just gonna tax you on unrealized capital gains, but \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [56:01]: Let me ask you: How do you balance that with not becoming fragilized by leverage? Is it just kind of a threshold that you would never borrow more than say 10% of the value of the collateral \u2014 something to that effect? Is that how you protect yourself?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: The fragility comes from two primary metrics: collateral coverage and the mark to market frequency of the loan \u2014 the duration of the loan. How frequently is the collateral marked to market? So for example, if you borrow money to buy a house and it\u2019s a 30-year mortgage and if the bank says to you, they\u2019re never gonna mark it down. Right? There\u2019s some loans like a mortgage loan where they\u2019ll never get marked down. They might get marked up \u2014 you can go to the bank and you can petition them to revalue your loan but nobody ever went to the bank and said, Mark my house to the market after the real estate market crashed! So if you buy a $1 Million house with an $800,000 loan, and you got $800,000 in debt and it\u2019s never marked to market then there\u2019s not that much fragility as long as you can make the $25,000 a year interest payment, assuming 3%, right? So that\u2019s not that risky \u2014 I mean a little bit risky, you can\u2019t make $25,000 and you lose it \u2014 but on the margin, if I didn\u2019t have the million bucks or I didn\u2019t have the $800,000 and somebody was willing to give me the $800,000 house for free, and all I did was pay $25,000 a year \u2014 I think that\u2019s a pretty good trade off! The worst that happens is they take the house back and I go do it again somewhere else. So that\u2019s not very fragile! How does it get fragile? It gets fragile when you buy a $1 Million worth of stock on a $800,000 loan and you\u2019ve got loan-to-value of 80%. And now, the stock trades down 20%! And the stock trades down 20% and the banker marks the collateral every day. And if you\u2019re in a swap with the bank, they will mark it to market every day. Every single day, they calculate the value of collateral, and if you\u2019re under you have to wire them the money the next day! And if you\u2019re over, they in theory have to wire you the money! And you have to mark it to market every day \u2014 that\u2019s risky! So if you were gonna buy $100 stock, you probably don\u2019t want to borrow more than 50%, but if you borrow 50% you damn well better think that the volatility\u2019s not gonna be 50%! You can\u2019t afford to! So probably in that case, if you thought the volatility was that it could lose half its value, you\u2019d want to borrow no more than 25%! And if you wanted to hold the stock even if it loses 80% of the value you can\u2019t borrow more than 20% loan-to-value, right? So the big risk, the hyper-risk is one of these Bitcoin exchanges that go 100:1 in leverage and I mark to market every hour! What if I mark to market every minute, Robert? I mean that the BitMex liquidation! I basically bought 100 Bitcoin, I pledge 1 Bitcoin, it gets marked to market every minute, and if the price goes down $100 I get wiped out and there\u2019s a crash! And it happens in 3 seconds. So that\u2019s risky. If you want to take the opposite point of view, I have 100 Bitcoin and I\u2019m gonna borrow the equivalent of 1 Bitcoin or 10 Bitcoin in value, and as long as it doesn\u2019t go more than 90% down, I\u2019m good. But if you wanted to save for one, you would say, I\u2019m gonna borrow against the collateral but I want you to agree that you won\u2019t ever mark it to market \u2014 that\u2019s what real estate loans are! Or a bank: I\u2019m gonna loan you money against your artwork or against your boat or against some other interesting collectible, and every year or every 5 years our appraiser is gonna reappraise it. So the issue is the frequency of the appraisal, combined with the volatility of the asset combined with the political regime you\u2019re in combined with the loan-to-value! If you\u2019re in a political regime where it\u2019s unacceptable to let real estate values go down, then you can reasonably expect that it\u2019s not likely your house is gonna be worth 20% of what you bought it for because the politicians won\u2019t let that happen! But they might not protect your Picasso painting! So if I borrowed money against a Picasso painting and the banker said we\u2019re gonna mark it to market every month, that\u2019s not as good as once a decade! So when you\u2019re thinking about risk, you\u2019re thinking about, How liquid is the collateral? And how frequent is the mark to market? And then how much is the loan-to-value? And that\u2019s how you get to a question of risk and what you should do and not do! I\u2019m not saying you have to do it, by the way! You could just sell the Bitcoin highly appreciated for cash, pay the tax, and take zero risk! And look, if the interest rate was 18% and you thought that the economy was gonna grow at 3\u20134%, then you would sell and you wouldn\u2019t take on the debt! So it\u2019s a function of interest rates as well, and productivity. Let\u2019s go back to this issue of our power equation: adoption, utility, productivity, inflation. We talked about adoption, and my point there was you\u2019re just syndicating \u2014 if the world was static, in a static world where there\u2019s $1 Trillion of assets, if you get $100 Billion on the network then that\u2019s better than $10 Billion! And $500 Billion is better than $100 Billion! And in a static world it\u2019s just all about recruiting and getting people to join the network. But the world is not strictly speaking static! The next thing is dynamic, and technology is what makes it dynamic! And that\u2019s where utility comes in! So if I can take Bitcoin and I can buy it from Square Cash, it\u2019s got more utility! If I can send it as $22 \u2014 if I can send it from Square Cash \u2014 if Square will convert my Bitcoin into dollars and send it in a split second, it\u2019s got more utility! If Apple Computer builds it into Apple Pay, and I can link a small wallet with 1% of my Bitcoin into Apple Pay and I can zap that around on my iPhone, it\u2019s got more utility! If Kraken creates a crypto bank and they offered me 4% interest and they\u2019ll offer it to me with institutional low-risk counterparty and they represent to me that they\u2019ve got $100 Billion of insurance and I can give them my crypto wallet and I get 4% interest on it or 6% and I trust them, the utility just went up again, and Bitcoin becomes more valuable! If I get to the point where I can manage my crypto keys using my retina scanner face ID and give speech instructions and I can say, Send Robert $37 of my crypto in cash \u2014 and if it always works and I just did it and it\u2019s more secure than a hardware key and I don\u2019t have to remember my 12 [word] seed key or whatever and it never fails \u2014 utility went up! Right? If I can say, Robert \u2014 maybe I\u2019ve got a girlfriend, Lisa\u2014 I could say, Send Lisa flowers on her birthday every year for the next decade \u2014 click! And it\u2019s jacked into my crypto\u2014utility went up! There\u2019s a lot of ways utility can go up. Buying stuff, selling stuff, etc. It\u2019s all a function of technology. If the Lightning Network works. In the ideal world, back to my example, I have X money \u2014 $10 Million \u2014 I have $100,000 in my checking account. I say, Move $100,000 in checking, leave the rest in the bank yielding 7% interest \u2014 tie my checking account into Apple Pay, link that to my Uber account, my sister\u2019s Uber account, my Domino\u2019s account, and use it to pay off Netflix, Google, this, that, and the other thing, and pledge it as trusted collateral on some dating network to show that I\u2019m a real person, and then use it to automatically pay all my fees on my domain registrations every year when they become due. There I just set it! I just did it \u2014 that\u2019s utility! That\u2019s [what we\u2019re looking for! 1:06:09]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: It\u2019s connecting it to productivity, right? It\u2019s enabling you to accomplish greater results with the same or less efforts! So the utility is a reflection of your productivity!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:06:21]: And that\u2019s a great segue to element 3 of the network power, and that\u2019s productivity! Well we have a million HODLers and they put $1 Million each into the network and now we have $1 Trillion in the network. Adopting it as your primary treasury reserve assets means sweeping your excess cash flows into Bitcoin, so those million people put $1 Million each, but how much money do they make each year, and how much do they save each year? So let\u2019s say they make $100,000 a year, and they save $10,000 a year. So $10,000 times a million \u2014 $10 Billion! So in that case $10 Billion in fiat gets converted into Bitcoin every year! That\u2019s the productivity! If they all get a raise \u2014 next year it\u2019ll be $11 Billion. The next year it\u2019ll be $12 Billion. If they all start their own business, the near year it\u2019ll be $30 Billion. If the economy\u2019s growing and they\u2019re inventing cool stuff and one of them becomes the next Michael Dell or Bill Gates or whatever, that person\u2019s gonna put in $100 Billion or $50 Billion! If you get lucky and one of your HODLers is Jeff Bezos he\u2019s gonna put in $37 Billion! So the productivity of the individuals is going to sweep cash flows into the network. And the same is true with the productivity of the corporations! So Microstrategy, we put $500 Million into a network, we make $50 Million a year. If we generate $50 Million a year after tax, we sweep that into the treasury, right? And do that 10 years in a row, our initial $500 Million is going to become $500 Million more of discounted cash flow! So now we\u2019re just back to some basic finance theory: What\u2019s the value of the stock? It\u2019s equal to the balance sheet cash value plus the discounting of the cash flows. The discounted value of the cash flows over time! So, the treasury that gets put in is the initial slug, and the discounted value of the cash flows of all the people in the network is the next value proposition. Of course, this kind of dovetails nicely with economic theory, because if the overall worldwide economy is flat and not growing, then the cash flows are not gonna grow! If the overall economy tanks and starts to deteriorate, the cash flows will deteriorate! If I destroy the economy, cash flows are going to zero, no value will accrete! And if I invent an atomic overthruster that gives you infinite energy in a sugar cube, presumably productivity is gonna go through the roof and cash flows are gonna go through the roof! So ultimately we\u2019re getting a bunch of people to join the network and then all of our fates are intertwined with all of our productivities! We\u2019ve created a cyber economy! Just like Warren Buffett said, Never bet against the United States. The United States was a 20th century physical economy and every business in it was working to the benefit of every other business in a competitive capitalist Darwinian ecosystem. Well now we\u2019re actually creating a cyber economy where you can be in a relationship with anybody else to the extent that, Robert, you adopt as a HODLer and I adopt as a corporate treasurer! If I\u2019m successful, you benefit! If you\u2019re successful, I benefit! Obviously, if we can get Apple Computer to put $100 Billion in and then sweep $50 Billion a year, we all benefit! And when a country does it, they benefit. And of course, if the people that join the network are more responsible, if they actually are productive and they save more than they spend, or they earn more in revenue than they spend in cost, then the network grows. And if they spend more on revenue, flip it the other way \u2014 a million HODLers all of a sudden save their money and then they start going crazy and partying and quit their jobs and buy Lambos and blow it all on champagne and gambling, they start drawing down their balances in the Bitcoin network and they sell their Bitcoin for fiat! And if they\u2019re selling it for fiat they\u2019re draining it out of the network! So the network is going to accrete with virtuous economic behavior and debase and dilute with vices!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:11:18]: I love the example that you use of the United States as being this Darwinian economic ecosystem of value creation! Because it was indeed a place in the world with the lowest impediments to free trade that actually led to America creating the most wealth and the most capital. And in many ways I think Bitcoin positively embodies a lot of the founding principles of American free market capitalism. You have inviolable property rights in Bitcoin, which in the American ecosystem actually marginally disrespected through Quantitative Easing and fiat currency printing. There\u2019s a rule of law here in the US, so we have non-violent dispute resolution and enforcement of contract law, and clearly the Bitcoin network is the most adept network at reaching global consensus we\u2019ve ever created! And then kind of from the first view, honest money or hard money would be something else that a real capitalist system puts out. So it\u2019s almost as if America as an experiment was the closest thing to pure capitalism we had prior to Bitcoin. Because again the nation state always gives in to that temptation to violate the money supply and thereby violate the private property rights of the citizens."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:12:46]: Now Robert, you jogged my memory, or jogged my thoughts. I\u2019ve described Bitcoin as a swarm of cyber hornets behind a wall of encrypted energy. Well the United States is a swarm of military assets: the navy, army, and air force, behind a wall of water! The insulation is the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean! 3,000 miles of water \u2014 you have to go through the army, the navy, and the air force, and that protected a bunch of capitalists, a bunch of entrepreneurs. In service of the goddess of wisdom, in this case in service of the American way! The American businesses pursuing the American Dream unhindered by interruption because they\u2019re behind a wall of water. You know if you go to Poland, they\u2019re good people too! I\u2019ve been there! I have a lot of Polish employees \u2014 they\u2019re brilliant! Between Russia and Germany. Again, Trotsky\u2019s point, You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you! It\u2019s kind of hard to go about your business when people are rolling over you with tanks this way and that way. And the equivalent of that in a monetary system or an energy system is with someone stealing your energy! Okay? How do I keep my coffee warm? I put it in a thermos! I need to insulate my energy so that no one steals it! If I take your Starbucks coffee and I put it in a cooler of ice and I drop it in the ice your coffee\u2019s getting cold! And so the wall of encrypted energy is the insulator. The wall of water is the insulator. The insulator is the insulator. The vacuum is the insulator. If you want a crucible of virtuous innovation, you need that vessel that serves as the insulator against all the forces that would attack it from without or [within] from fear with this process. And that is Bitcoin, right? We\u2019re creating that! And having said all that, right: adoption, utility, productivity \u2014 those three things create that monetary chemical reaction of sorts. And the last piece is inflation. But inflation is almost just the way that we translate the energy \u2014 it\u2019s a translation coefficient of the energy into a frame of reference of the dimensionality or the domain where I\u2019m spending it. I mean, I\u2019m gonna have to translate my monetary energy into Rubles or Pesos of Dollars or Euros of Yen if I cross into one of those domains, because it\u2019s their world, not our world! So if the Dollar didn\u2019t inflate, then would Bitcoin go up? If the United States had a perfect monetary policy \u2014 no inflation \u2014 could Bitcoin succeed? Yeah! It could succeed! If people adopt it \u2014 because it\u2019s got technical advantages, right? If they adopt it as a reserve asset, I mean their choice is that versus stock versus bonds versus property \u2014 you still have the issue of: How do I commute energy through time and space? So I would still adopt it! Technology will still get better! I mean if there was no inflation you would still like the iPhone. You would still like Zooming to me if there was no inflation! Technology would get better, and we\u2019d have productivity! We\u2019d be inventing stuff: fusion, better materials, etc. And when we created stuff like Zooming and we put together Zoom with YouTube, we would talk, and someone would put it up on YouTube and 100,000 people would see it and 3 people would have an idea and something would happen that wouldn\u2019t have happened otherwise! You don\u2019t need inflation for Bitcoin to be successful anymore than you need it for Google or Apple or Amazon to be successful \u2014 it just happens that in an inflationary environment it accelerates \u2014 2% inflation will grow it 2% faster, 10% inflation will grow it 10% faster \u2014 in theory if a bond is pure energy and if bonds are inflating at 20%, then that means that Bitcoin will have a 20% real yield in that currency where you see that energy inflation! And it\u2019ll be different relative to the frame of reference of every single domain or every country depending upon how they choose to manage their currency. They could in theory \u2014 I could peg the Dollar, like in Singapore or the UAE I peg to the Dollar. I could peg to gold. If I peg to gold, it\u2019ll be a 3\u20134% differential. If I peg to the Dollar it could be a 10\u201315% differential. If I peg to the Peso it could be a 32% differential. So all of the value of Bitcoin relative to the people in the ecosystems in the domain will vary! And of course, that\u2019s why if I\u2019m in Lebanon or Argentina, this is even more insanely valuable to me than if I\u2019m in Switzerland!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:18:48]: Absolutely! I would just maybe add that 2% inflation would increase adoption say by 2%, but as you increase the inflation rate, I think it would actually be non-linear, because if you take the extreme example of hyperinflation, everyone would pile out of their currency into the Dollar or into Bitcoin \u2014 something that was more reliable, such that, as you increase from say 2% to 10%, people\u2019s inflation expectations actually increase, which gives them further incentive to move into Bitcoin or something alternative."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:19:24]: It\u2019s multivariate, non-linear, and one dynamic is: Hyperinflation panics people into it, high inflation pushes them into it, low inflation encourages them into it, but we\u2019re marking the value of the Bitcoin to all the assets \u2014 the tangible assets, all the products and services and assets in the domain which is being inflated \u2014 and that\u2019s also having a frame of reference impact. So the frame of reference changes literally when it\u2019s $1 Million for a cup of coffee \u2014 Bitcoin\u2019s gonna be worth $1 Billion, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Yeah. That is the Number Go Up technology!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Probably you will get that! And that is Bitcoin network power dynamic. That is the dynamic there, and everybody that\u2019s marketing Bitcoin, they\u2019re contributing to it. Everyone working on Bitcoin technology is contributing to it. Everyone simply HODLing Bitcoin is contributing to it. Everybody that hates it, or everybody attacking every other asset or every time another asset fails or another currency weakens it contributes to it. And then just the relentless passage of time contributes to it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:22:23]: I think this is a brilliant and unique way to look at the network effects of Bitcoin! And I also find it interesting that at the center of this vortex is the highest expression of truth we\u2019ve ever had! Bitcoin is literally this system of converting energy into indisputable truth about who owns what UTXOs, and the 21 Million again is kind of like the third certainty in life. We\u2019ve had Death and Taxes, and now in the socioeconomic sphere at least we have this number 21 Million we know that can\u2019t be violated. And that\u2019s what\u2019s spurring all these effects!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:23:01]: Bitcoin is a cyber economy based upon the principles of truth, respecting the laws of thermodynamics, respecting Newton\u2019s laws. If you\u2019re gonna worship the goddess of energy, you better respect the laws of conservation of energy! And it is that conservative monetary energy system. The first conservative monetary energy system that we\u2019ve ever invented\u2014anybody can choose to be a member: any individual, any family, any company, any government, can choose to become a member of this closed energy system. And conservative energy is truth! It starts with this simple principle: energy can be neither created nor destroyed! You could lose control of it! You have it \u2014 you could lose control of it and it can dissipate and you can lose it! And so that doesn\u2019t mean you can be lazy or sloppy. You have to channel the energy! But Bitcoin is the best system in the history of the world for controlling, storing, and channeling energy, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s destined to be successful!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:24:24]: I love \u2014 I\u2019ve never heard it put like that! That conservative energy is truth! That ties it back to how we started this conversation of the eagle dragging the goat off the cliff side: it\u2019s employing the least energy necessary to accomplish the greatest result. And that\u2019s what you want to bet on. That is the winning strategy on which you want to bet. And it points towards the kernel of all economics, which is: scarcity gives things market value. Scarcity is the driver of market value. Things that are hard to obtain and have utility are what give them value in the marketplace."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: The ultimate scarce asset in the universe is energy! You can\u2019t create more of it! If I give this much to you, you can\u2019t wiggle your fingers and make it twice as much! If you lose it, it\u2019s gone! And you can play all these games and thermodynamics \u2014 it\u2019s a great field because everybody thinks \u2014 they\u2019re all looking for that perpetual motion machine. The laws of thermodynamics, we used to paraphrase them at MIT in a snarky way, we\u2019d say, You can\u2019t win, you can\u2019t break even, and you can\u2019t get out of the game! The laws of thermodynamics! It\u2019s like, from a layman\u2019s point of view: You can\u2019t cheat! There is no cheating in thermodynamics! It might look like you got something for nothing \u2014 even Maxwell\u2019s demon. He posed, Maybe I could actually fight or reverse entropy and get order from disorder by dividing a chamber and I have a demon and there\u2019s a little door and molecules are bouncing around, and what if my demon opened the door when the molecule bounced from the right to the left and closed it before the [molecule] bounced from the left to the right? I could over time with randomness get all of the bouncy molecules on one side of the chamber and I could reduce entropy. And they couldn\u2019t figure that out! They called it Maxwell\u2019s demon. Well what\u2019s wrong with that argument? Doesn\u2019t that break the laws of thermodynamics? And the answer came along 100 years later when some IBM computer scientist pointed out that information is building up in the head of the demon, and the information is in and of itself creating entropy, and so no you\u2019re not cheating! Once you actually account for all the information, disorder, and energy in the system, it did respect the laws of thermodynamics! You can\u2019t cheat time. You can\u2019t cheat space. There is ultimately conservation! And Isaac Newton \u2014 all of Newton\u2019s laws: conservation of mass, conservation of energy F = ma, it\u2019s the basis of physics, the basis of mechanics, the basis of every machine we\u2019ve built that works, it\u2019s the basis of all of our heat exchange, and it hasn\u2019t been \u2014I mean scientists and engineers don\u2019t have a high opinion of economists. And one of the reasons why is that it hasn\u2019t been important for economists to understand closed systems, isolated systems, servomechanisms, conservation of mass and energy, E = mc\u23032. E = mc\u23032 matters! What it means is: If there\u2019s mass, it becomes exponentially expensive to move it around. E is the energy! You wanna move stuff fast? You need to take the mass to zero! And that\u2019s how you move stuff fast! So economists, maybe what they were doing didn\u2019t matter before Bitcoin! You could say, maybe Bitcoin is the first time that technology crashed into economics! You have energy, you have technology, you have math crashing into economics and now you couldn\u2019t really be a competent economist without appreciating closed systems, energy efficiency, math, conservation of everything!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:29:01]: Yeah! Another thing this calls to mind and maybe a unique way to look at Bitcoin: We can\u2019t break the laws of thermodynamics. Those are the rules of the game within which we are operating in physical reality. And Bitcoin in a way maps onto that system very nicely, because it gives us an economic system in which we cannot break the laws. It perfectly respects and aligns itself with the laws of thermodynamics in the economic sphere! And another thing this made me think of was \u2014 this was a framework I got from you on inflation \u2014 was that, CPI is low, but everything you want is inflating rapidly. You could probably plot that on a spectrum as, The things that are more energy intensive to create are inflating more rapidly, and the things that are created easily are tweaked and controlled and dumped into that CPI bucket!"}

{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [06:58]: Bitcoin theory! It\u2019s a field you wouldn\u2019t have thought you would\u2019ve heard about even 5 years ago!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: Well, when I think of Bitcoin, I think: this is the first digital monetary system in the history of the world! We\u2019ve tried others, they just didn\u2019t work! This is the first one that\u2019s perfected, that\u2019s functioning! It\u2019s the first one to cross $100 Billion in market cap and now it\u2019s about $200 Billion in market cap. $200 Billion means $200 Billion of monetary energy, and if I look at all of the great digital networks \u2014 Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 when they cross $100 Billion of monetary energy, then that\u2019s a legitimizing step! Generally when they get there, 95% or more of the investing community doesn\u2019t believe in them! Sometimes 99% doesn\u2019t believe in them! But they\u2019re too big to fail \u2014 they\u2019re fires that have been unleashed into the society, and they\u2019re burning, and the effect is exothermal. What we have in each of these networks is: we have the collapse, a dematerialization of some product or service or virtue or some ineffable quality be it friendship or mobile devices or information. It\u2019s collapsing into a lower energy state. And as it collapses into a lower energy state, huge amounts of energy in the form of profit, cash flow, and value get given off! Apple can ship a better camera to a billion people overnight for a nickel! Facebook can improve the way that you communicate to your loved ones overnight for a nickel! And Google can package the Library of Alexandria in the palm of your hand and ship it to a billion people overnight for a nickel! And when you have these massive dematerializations of value and they get on a network with a network effect, it\u2019s almost like \u2014 well you see a crystallizing structure where you\u2019ve got an amorphous substance and as it crystallizes we go from steam to water to ice! Collapses, gives off energy. And what Bitcoin is, is it\u2019s that first digital monetary network, digital monetary system. It\u2019s collapsing into a much more efficient form, it\u2019s giving off energy! And that just brings us back to that entire subject of: how important is energy to the human race!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [09:52]: Let me just ask you a question there: there\u2019s a chart with phase transitions of say, water, of going from ice to water to steam as its temperature increases, and it shows increases in temperature, and when it actually goes into the phase transition it flatlines! So it\u2019s like all that energy is being reallocated to I guess changing the molecular structure for the next state. Then the temperature starts to increase again as it goes into water, and then it flatlines again before going into steam. So I guess what you\u2019re getting at is that energy becomes transmuted into the next state before it can start to give off energy in the form of profit, productivity \u2014 it\u2019s giving back economic substance to its users. And I think that\u2019s sort of the analogy you\u2019re drawing there?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [10:44]: Yeah it\u2019s a wild thing when all the monetary energy leaps from gold to Bitcoin! Or when it leaps from fiat to Bitcoin! There\u2019s this phase transition, and we see it throughout all areas of science, but right now this is just the first time in human history that we see this creation of pure digital monetary network! And I want to replace monetary network with energy network, because monetary energy is energy! And money is energy! In fact, money is the highest form of energy! So if we ask the question, What is money? Money is the highest form of energy that human beings can channel. So if I look back through time, human beings as a species prosper by channeling energy. And when we mastered fire, we channeled chemical energy. And when we mastered missiles we channel kinetic energy. And when we master water and hydraulics, we\u2019re actually channeling gravitational energy. The idea of an aqueduct is, well, I\u2019m using gravity to move water 70 miles! Or I\u2019m running a water wheel, or I\u2019m floating a 2-ton block in the water and the gravity\u2019s pushing down on the water and the water is pushing up! And when I dam a stream and I generate hydro energy, well that\u2019s gravity being converted into energy. But if I dam the stream to divert a bunch of fish into my pond, I\u2019m still using gravity! Now, I can channel gravity by dumping a bunch of rocks on your head, but it\u2019s not nearly so easy to create a river of rocks as it is to just tap into a river of water! And so the mastery of fire and water is the mastery of chemical energy, gravitational energy, eventually thermal energy, and the modern era morphed into the mastery of electrical energy and atomic energy. And of course there\u2019s conservation of energy, and when we look at all of these energy networks, I mean look \u2014 100 guys with bows and arrows are an energy network! I\u2019m moving kinetic energy from this side of the battlefield to that side of the battlefield! And a civilization at the mouth of a river with cities up and down the river is sitting on an energy network, just like the Aegean, and the Greek civilization was sitting at the middle of an energy network and they were using gravitational energy. And wind energy \u2014 another form of energy between sails and gravity \u2014 I\u2019m taking advantage of these energies! So the theme is: humans prosper by channeling energy. Now, what\u2019s the most efficient energy network in the history of the world? Well it\u2019s about to be Bitcoin! Because the challenge of humanity is: how do I store energy and transmit energy across time and space and domain? And by domain I mean perhaps governmental domain \u2014 like how do I move my energy from New York to Tokyo? And this becomes an interesting question! Let\u2019s take a typical power grid: well I generate power, I channel chemical energy into electrical energy, I lose like 35% of the energy in the coal or in the fossil fuel. When it gets onto the grid, I move it over a high voltage line, and I can move it up to about 500 miles and I lose 2% of the energy. Now it has to get stepped down to 240 volts or lower voltage even, to get into your house. As the voltage steps down, I lose more energy \u2014 it\u2019s about a 4% loss. If I had pure energy at the power plant, I\u2019m gonna lose 6% of the energy to put it into your house 250 miles away! I can\u2019t send 2,000 miles away \u2014 I just can\u2019t I can\u2019t send it 10,000 miles away \u2014 energy will not move from New York to Tokyo. But I can New York to Schenectady! Now when it gets into your house, you have to use it immediately! You can\u2019t store it! So let\u2019s say I wanted to store it \u2014 I need a battery! Well the absence of a battery prevents a mechanism. The mobile wave is a function of Lithium ion batteries in the palm of your hand \u2014 no Lithium ion battery, no smart phone! Now we\u2019re working with modern batteries. Tesla: it\u2019s all about the battery, right? And Elon Musk has really driven battery technology! So let\u2019s say I put a battery in your house. And you pull energy into your house. Well you\u2019ve lose 6%! Now a typical battery \u2014 a good one \u2014 is gonna lose 2% per month! Okay, that means you\u2019re gonna lose 24% of your energy a year! Well what does that sound like? It sounds like 24% inflation a year! It sounds like hyperinflation \u2014 it could get worse, right? Hyperinflation is 100% inflation a year! Let\u2019s say that I have a battery which loses 20% of my power a year, well my half-life on my energy that I pulled off the plant is 3.5 years in 10 years! I\u2019m down to 12.5% of my energy! So the entire civilization is based upon electric power grids and networks, and yet it\u2019s not that good! I mean you really can\u2019t store that much power! Anybody that ever put their computer, they charged it and left the computer for a month or 2 months and you whipped it open, it\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s drained!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [17:13]: It\u2019s dead, yeah!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: Okay so now, let\u2019s say I want to take $100 Million. By the way, I could take $100 Million of money, and I can buy $100 Million of electricity in New York, and I can distribute it to 10 Million people in New York \u2014 as long as they use it today! So if they don\u2019t use it today, it starts to bleed out. And so this is the loss on the network."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: And in a monetary sense, we would say that energy really lacks durability, right? And I think this is important too to tie this back to money, is that gold itself \u2014 to your point \u2014 was an energy network! Whatever productivity couldn\u2019t be allocated towards something more economic, we would go and mine gold, such that gold became this claim on savings of humanity\u2014which is what money is. And those savings themselves are the result of all our collective energy utilization up until that point. We\u2019ve been transitioning energy into capital, and then gold, or money, becomes the network that commands that capital, and then what I think is interesting too is that the scarcity of the gold actually reflects the scarcity of the energy. So it maps onto it in a way.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [18:44]: A brilliant insight! And now let\u2019s play a thought experiment: let\u2019s take our $100 Million worth of monetary energy and let\u2019s put it in a power network that runs on copper, and then let\u2019s put it into a gold network! If I put it into a copper energy network, I have 24% bleed rate per year by the time it gets to the battery. I lose 6%, and I can\u2019t get it more than 500 miles. Okay, so it\u2019s a very short term, short duration, here and now energy network. Let\u2019s put it into a gold network: I put $100 Million into gold. Now I can move that $100 Million of gold 100 miles \u2014 would I lose 6%? Probably not 6%! I could probably move $100 Million of gold 100 miles for $10,000-$100,000 depending on how much security I need! So we\u2019re talking about 10 basis points, instead of 600 basis points of loss. 10 basis points! So gold is a more efficient way to move large amounts of energy for short distances. What if I want to move $100 Million of gold 10,000 miles? Well, that\u2019s about 3,000 lbs of gold, 1.5 tons. So I put it on a global express, it costs $10,000 an hour, I put some dudes with guns on it, I fly 16\u201318 hours around the world \u2014 that\u2019s about $180,000 plus another $70,000. $250,000. If I have to fly the plane back \u2014 let\u2019s just assume I don\u2019t! It\u2019s $250,000, so now we\u2019re up to like 25 basis points. 0.25% is the cost to move it around the world once! Okay? So that\u2019s okay. Now what if I want to deliver $100 Million of gold 100 years into the future? What if I wanted to deliver $100 Million of energy 100 years into the future on copper and batteries? Well my half-life is at 24% at 2% bleed a month. My half-life is 3.5 years. It\u2019s gone completely! And everybody with any common sense knows if you put your laptop charged in your attic for 100 years, it will not be charged in 100 years! You cannot store electricity on a copper network or a Lithium ion battery, it\u2019s no good! I put it in gold, put it in a vault. So let\u2019s say I put it in a vault in J.P. Morgan in 1900 in the United States of America. And the United States is the most successful country in the 20th century: we win every war, and J.P. Morgan remains as a bank and the vault in New York remains. In that case, assuming a 2% mining rate, assuming a stock to flow of 50 and miners mine 2% more gold a year, the half-life of a gold battery is 35 years. I go from $100 Million to $50 Million in 35 years, to $25 Million in 70 years. So about $12.5 Million in 100 years! So I\u2019ve depleted my gold battery 87% if the United States wins every war, and if J.P. Morgan isn\u2019t a corrupt institution and doesn\u2019t fail, and if no one drops a nuclear bomb on New York City! If those things don\u2019t happen then I will get 12% of my money back!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [23:00]: So in addition to betting on gold, which is governed by natural law, you\u2019re also assuming this counterparty risk in the form of US Government, in the form of J.P. Morgan. You have to bet on stability in the geopolitical landscape as well! Because the gold has to be secured, and it has to be secured by institutions!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [23:21]: What if you put a $100 Million worth of gold into a bank in Frankfurt in 1900? What if you put it in the largest bank in Japan in Tokyo in 1900? Name a city and a bank you could have put it in in 1900 that will still be there in the year 2000? It\u2019s a short list! London, Z\u00fcrich, New York! You would\u2019ve failed in Paris, Berlin, anywhere in Eastern Europe, you would\u2019ve failed in Moscow, you would\u2019ve lost it all in Beijing, you would\u2019ve lost it all in Tokyo, you would\u2019ve lost it all anywhere south of the Rio Grande, you would\u2019ve lost it everywhere in Africa \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: And in the US, possibly with Executive Order 6102 would have impacted you in the US?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [24:14]: And you would have lost it in the US!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Yeah. In the long run we\u2019re all dead! I think Keynes may have said that.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: He said it, Robert Heinlein wrote a book called Lifeline and he said, Over a long enough timeline, the mortality rate is 100% And so in this particular case, back to our gold network. We have a gold network and we want to move money, so I put $100 Million in gold and I want to move it around \u2014 well it\u2019s 25 basis points every time I want to move it around. If I want to move it once a quarter, it\u2019s 1% bleed a year if I move it once a quarter. If I mine it it\u2019s 2% bleed a year. That gets me to 3% bleed a year. Divide that into 70 and every 22 years \u2014 that\u2019s the half-life of gold. Energy on a gold network has a half-life of 22 years at best! When you throw in the counterparty risk and the need to move it around \u2014 let\u2019s just assume that we move it around so you don\u2019t lose it! You\u2019re just down to now the issue of technology and commodity risk. And this is an important point: gold is the king of commodities! Gold is the greatest of all human commodities! But my first job at DuPont was I built computer simulations of commodities and specialty chemical networks, and let me tell you what people in that business think: they think commodity is a dirty word! The first thing I learned is: commodity is awful! Nobody wants to be in a commodity business! And here\u2019s the reason commodities are awful: if I actually create a factory that creates a commodity, say, gasoline \u2014 the only thing it can do is create gasoline! If I invest $10 Billion into gasoline refinery, my fixed cost are $10 Billion. The ideal, rational price for me to make a profit? Probably at $4 a gallon? But my variable cost is $1.50 a gallon, because I\u2019ve got all these billions of dollars in the factory! What happens is, when I create commodity refineries, when the price below the profitable point, I will still keep running the factory, because I\u2019ve got a variable margin. I\u2019m generating cash flow even though I\u2019m driving the price down for everybody else in the business. So it\u2019s possible in the commodity business for every single producer to be losing money! And for them to all be acting irrationally, and they\u2019re all pumping out the commodity be it silver \u2014 if you\u2019re a gold miner, what can you do other than mine gold? Once I\u2019ve gone and I\u2019ve invested $100 Billion in mining gold, if the price of gold is cut in half, but my variable cost is $400 an ounce and it\u2019s $800 an ounce, I\u2019m mining gold and selling it at $800 an ounce! I\u2019m selling it at $700 an ounce! I\u2019m selling it at $600! When it gets to $500, I\u2019m selling it because the market is not rational \u2014 I can\u2019t transmute my $100 Billion of gold mining capital into Google stock!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Right, the switching costs are too high! It\u2019s just not possible!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [28:28]: And maybe I\u2019ve been captured by the government. Maybe a certain government wants to mine gold! Maybe I can\u2019t legally stop even if I wanted to stop! So when you have a commodity business where people have specialized capital and they make those investments, what happens over time everywhere in every industry in every commodity in the history of the world is: the producers overproduce the commodity because, in the phrase of Hotel California, You can check in anytime you want, but you can\u2019t ever leave! It\u2019s a one-way route! You go in, you can\u2019t get out! So that takes us to this real issue of gold, or the real risk of gold, which is: gold prices goes up by a factor of 10, capital gets attracted into commodity production. It\u2019s a feedback: people produce more, gold price goes down, people keep producing to try to recover their cash flows, lots of intelligent people become desperate. When men are desperate, they invent new techniques to produce more gold. They keep producing because they don\u2019t have a choice! They will produce down until the variable cost equals the price, then they will keep producing below variable cost, because it\u2019s possible that they\u2019re in a situation where they can lay off \u2014 for example: a government that takes ownership of a gold mine will produce below variable cost in order to maintain jobs."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: They\u2019ll subsidize it, yeah!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [30:14]: Where has this happened? Automobiles and airlines! This is why you don\u2019t ever want to be a budget airline because a government will operate airline flights at a variable cost loss in order to avoid shutting down the airline, right? If you\u2019re Singapore and you turn off the airlines because they\u2019re not profitable, you turned off your bridge to the world! The politicians will run the airline below variable cost. If I want to keep jobs \u2014 and how many countries want to project jobs \u2014 if I want to project jobs, I will produce something and sell it below the variable cost. We do that with anything that is politically charged! When a government decides: education, healthcare, transportation, automobiles, local manufacturing, security, defense \u2014 defense is a great example of something that we produce whether we like it or not at a cost that\u2019s higher than potentially the value and use of it! And we can\u2019t stop! It creates this industrial complex."}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [31:31]: A good point there that I think reinforces your earlier point too: you said that gold was the greatest commodity in history. I think the point there is that it is the greatest commodity in history because it commands human time or commands savings. It commands the collective output of capital that humanity has ever created. So in that way it\u2019s kind of like the smartest form of energy, because human beings \u2014 our ingenuity, our time, our ability to see the world \u2014 we are the greatest form of economic energy in the world, and gold is the instrument that commands that energy!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [32:13]: For thousands of years, it was the best commodity that we could produce to store our energy in. Partly it was hard, but it\u2019s not the hardest thing to produce! I think there are other commodities that are harder to produce! But it was the best combination of being hard and then being durable and being non-toxic\u2014right? There are toxic things that kill us! There are things that aren\u2019t durable that are unstable. I\u2019m sure we figured out how to produce gold before we figured out how to produce Uranium or Polonium. So there\u2019s other stuff, but gold \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: The other important piece too is that gold is indestructible. Such that every ounce we ever mined is pretty much still part of the extant supply. I think it\u2019s two Olympic-sized swimming pools of gold that we\u2019ve ever produced!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: You want stability, right? It takes us back to why Marjorie Merriweather Post was the richest woman in the world! Because Post cereal was starch was stable in a box for a year! Stability at room temperature! Like, Coca-Cola is stable at room temperature in a can. And gold is stable energy! So yeah it\u2019s energy but nonetheless it\u2019s a commodity, and you know what they call a business when it\u2019s been totally wrecked? They call it commoditized! [inaudible] And so every businessperson forever has always strived to avoid being commoditized! That\u2019s the origin of branding, right? We branded sugar water, we branded Gucci bags, we branded everything. We patent things, we brand things, because we want to avoid the inevitable result! The result is: as soon as something is commoditized and open to the public and anybody can produce it, its value goes to the variable cost of production and then it goes below! For example, Apple Computer \u2014 worth $2 Trillion today \u2014 Google, worth more than a Trillion, Facebook. These are valuable networks! But are they the most valuable networks? No! They\u2019re not the most valuable networks to humanity \u2014 they\u2019re the most valuable non-commoditized networks! Because if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on Google, it\u2019s inconvenient. But if I go to New York City and I pull the plug on the power company, it\u2019s deadly! If I cut off your power and your water or even turn off the bridge \u2014 people die! If I turn off Google, Facebook, and Apple \u2014 nobody in New York City\u2019s going to die, right? And so people forget this! And this is the danger of putting all your wealth, of storing your wealth in Apple stock! The world thinks Apple, Google, Facebook \u2014 Big Tech \u2014 they\u2019re a store of value! And post-pandemic, everybody surged into the NASDAQ five, and the NASDAQ, because of Big Tech equity \u2014 this is a store of value! I\u2019ll be safe here! We\u2019ll you\u2019ll be safe there for a year, or two years, but you know, General Electric and General Motors and Standard Oil were once, they were the most important networks on Earth, and they changed humanity a lot more than Google, Apple, and Facebook did! And you want to change your life? Try to go a week without electricity and see if there aren\u2019t riots, murders, mayhem! So people don\u2019t ask the question, Why is it that I get my electricity for nothing? Why do I get my water for nothing? Because you try to go 3 days without water, 3 days without electricity, you see what that\u2019s like! And the answer is: because those two things got declared as public utilities \u2014 that they\u2019re so important that nobody have a monopoly on it! As soon as Standard Oil became so instrumental that it changed the Western world, politicians got interested in Standard Oil! And if your power company said, We just decided to jack the cost of electricity by a factor of 10. Would you pay it? Sure you\u2019d pay it, right? Would you complain? Who would you complain to? A politician, right? So we\u2019ve got these networks, they\u2019re really important! But eventually if they\u2019re important enough, they become commodity networks. And so that\u2019s an interesting characteristic. The reason that gold doesn\u2019t work over time is \u2014 we have two examples. It doesn\u2019t work over time because people produce 2\u20133% more of it every year, and over 100 years that means you lose 90% of your energy. It doesn\u2019t work over time because there\u2019s counterparty risks, and the Polish bank, through no fault of their own, got overrun by the Nazis in World War II, and Beijing bank got overrun by first one regime then another regime then a third regime! So that\u2019s another reason it doesn\u2019t work! And a third reason it doesn\u2019t work is if the people become threatened by the network \u2014 so for example 1933, Franklin Delanor Roosevelt found gold to be inconvenient \u2014 if the people become threatened, they complain to the politicians. The politicians might go ahead and take action, and in this case, the reason they were able to take action is because all the gold was sitting in the same place! So if the gold\u2019s sitting in a vault and we know where it is, and it\u2019s under the control of institutions, the institutions are under control of government and therefore that heightens the counterparty risk because of the centralized nature of gold. So the best case for a gold network is you\u2019re gonna lose 90% of your energy over 100 years! But the likely case is you\u2019re gonna lose 95%-98% of your energy over 100 years. And if we look at Nicholas Taleb\u2019s range of outcomes, if you take the 100 biggest cities in the world and you put your gold in the best bank in any of the hundred cities in the world, it looks like in 95\u201396 of them or maybe 99 of them, you lost all your money! You lost all your gold!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [39:51]: So that highlights too one of the shortcomings of gold is that the economies of scale lead to its centralization! Because it is so heavy and hard to transact \u2014 compared to Bitcoin, that\u2019s non-corporeal, it can be transmitted at the speed of light \u2014 because gold is so heavy to settle, that that leads to its centralization in bank vaults, and that becomes the ultimate honey pot for politicians and governments, frankly! And the other attack vector we didn\u2019t discuss is that temptation is always given into! As soon as things get dicey, governments immediately monopolize that gold energy network, which is the most important in the world!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [40:39]: Let\u2019s say\u2014it\u2019s not fast enough! Every good technology is smarter, faster, stronger! Every technology! Smarter, faster, stronger! So coming to digital gold versus gold: physical gold is not fast enough! How fast is it? If I wanted to move $100 Million of gold, as we talked about, it\u2019s gonna cost me $250,000. So that\u2019s an impedance! But how long is that gonna take you? A week? A month? Somewhere between \u2014 you wanna move 3,000 lbs of gold from New York? I\u2019ve got a month I\u2019m guessing, if you want to get all the protocols set up. So you\u2019re talking about a quarter-million dollars and a month to move the gold. Assuming I needed another custodian and I used Bitcoin, and I wanted to move $100 Million to Bitcoin \u2014 and this is where Bitcoin critics are just utterly wrong and missing the point! \u2014 they all think, Oh, well it takes 30 minutes and $5 to move Bitcoin! And they\u2019re comparing it to a new crypto network that has no value on it! And they\u2019re saying, I can find a way to move it in 5 minutes for a nickel \u2014 but that\u2019s not the point! The appropriate comparison is to gold! How long would it take to move $100 Million of gold? Because there\u2019s $250 Trillion in assets in the alt-assets! And there\u2019s only $25 Billion of real assets in the altcoins or the alt-cryptos. So how long does it take me to move the $250 Trillion around? And when you think about that you realize that Bitcoin would move it in 30 minutes instead of 30 days. Okay? That\u2019s 1,440x as fast! A thousand times as fast a minute versus 1,440 minutes in a day. And so it\u2019s a thousand times as fast, but then it\u2019s $5 versus $250,000! So that\u2019s 50,000x cheaper! So now we\u2019ve got people saying, Oh well it\u2019s very energy efficient \u2014 blah blah blah! Well it\u2019s not, really! It\u2019s inefficient in the way that it\u2019s inefficient to create an electro high speed transit system, a mass-transit system. It was expensive to build the mass-transit system, it got really really cheap to move onto the rails! If you look at the history of railroads, the biggest thing in the 19th century was railroads. It was pretty expensive to create the railroads! It became really cheap to move on the rails! So what we do is we\u2019ve created crypto rails in order to make it 50,000x cheaper to move! But it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s 50,000x cheaper, it\u2019s that it\u2019s 1,000x faster and 50,000x cheaper, and then when you start to multiply 1,000 x 50,000, and you realize \u2014 it starts to be 50,000,000x faster, and then you start to add that third dimension, which is maybe a computer that thinks about this while you\u2019re sleeping 18,000 times, and you realize eventually you get to 50,000,000,000x faster! And now we\u2019ve got to a new engineering or new scientific metaphor which is: superconducting networks! There\u2019s impedance going through an electric power network and you\u2019re losing it, so the solution is that I need to get this superconducted! So I gotta cool the network down to close to near-zero, and it\u2019s expensive! And the point is: Yeah! It\u2019s expensive to get to near-zero, and then the impedance disappears in the network and the friction goes away! And what could you do if the friction went completely away?"}

So you achieve superconductivity and in a way that\u2019s what Bitcoin is! It\u2019s a monetary medium completely free of the noise of unexpected inflation, so you\u2019re actually conveying pure price signal!

You could think about when you encrypt monetary energy on the Bitcoin network, it\u2019s like achieving escape velocity out of the gravity well! What we\u2019ve done \u2014 we paid a price to get out of the gravity well. Throw a baseball on a baseball field, it goes a couple of hundred feet. Get out of the gravity well, throw the baseball, it\u2019ll go around the Earth forever! So how much more distance do you get out of the baseball if you pay the price of getting out of the gravity well? It\u2019s not like 10x better, it\u2019s not 100x better, it\u2019s not 1,000,000x better, it goes to infinity, and it never stops! And that\u2019s the breakthrough that people don\u2019t get, it\u2019s like, What can I do if I had vacuum, and I was rid of friction? And yeah there\u2019s a price to pay! And that\u2019s your phase change and your state change, and that\u2019s why I would say: Bitcoin is the most efficient system for channeling energy through time and space in the history of mankind! We\u2019ve never figured out how to channel energy with no impedance and channel energy with no loss! But let\u2019s come back to the outer space analogy: take your flashlight and shine it in your basement. Take your flashlight and shine it on your baseball field. Now get into outer space and take your flashlight and shine it, or flip it the other way: the Hubble telescope!

If I put my $100 Million of monetary energy \u2014 I have energy. I take energy, I sell it on the grid, you give me money! I take my money, I put it into the US dollar bank \u2014 it\u2019s in fiat.

So we\u2019re not even \u2014 what to say is: you\u2019re losing 99% of your energy. 99% of your energy is being charitable! Now let\u2019s generate $100 Million worth of electricity by burning coal or nuclear power or peddling on my flywheel or rowing on my row machine \u2014 however you got to it \u2014 windmills!

Put it in their vault \u2014 I guess I could just take it with me, it\u2019s 3,000 lbs! It\u2019s $2,000 an ounce, or whatever the number is! Okay so 1.5 tons \u2014 no! I gotta put it in a vault, right? So I put it in a vault and I pay for custody fees and going in there\u2019s a fee, and then I\u2019m paying, whatever, 20, 30, 40 basis points a year to keep it, and then the miners are out there doing their mining thing and it\u2019s probably 200 basis points worth of additional gold. So that\u2019s 250 basis points a year.

The fracking risk is \u2014 academics always opine about shortages. Academics have been saying there\u2019s an oil shortage, and energy shortage coming! They\u2019ve been saying it since the Club of Rome in 1973 or something! They said it in the \u201950s, \u201960s, \u201970s, \u201980s, and \u201990s, and the world always predicted that we were gonna run out of oil or energy in about 10 years. I studied this at MIT \u2014 I created computer simulations about it. There\u2019s an entire school of thought \u2014 system dynamics \u2014 that studies these things. And the flaw in the reasoning is: it\u2019s a linear interpretation of the world instead of a closed feedback or a non-linear interpretation of the world. The linear interpretation of the world is: we\u2019ve got 10 years worth of oil because that\u2019s what our main proven reserves are! The closed loop interpretation of the world is: when we actually get to 5 years worth of reserves, people start looking for more reserves! And so, no company wants to carry on their balance sheet more than about 10 years worth. And then they just keep finding more, but they don\u2019t publish it. We\u2019re not factoring in human will to live, human ingenuity! People have a tendency that when you tell them they\u2019re about to run out of something, they reprioritize, they think a little bit harder, and they come up with an innovative solution! So that\u2019s what happened with fracking. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil, we had a crisis, and eventually the price of oil went high enough. The people sat down and said, You know? If we invent a new chemistry, and if we raised some capital, we can go ahead and implement fracking, and we doubled the amount of oil! And we did it fast! We had 5 Million barrels a day for like 40 years and that was conventional wisdom and everybody thought, That\u2019s it! And then we went the next year to 6 Million, the next year to 7 Million, the next year to 8 Million, the next year to 9 Million, the next year to 10 Million! And I watched it happen, and I watched all of the big investment bankers \u2014 J.P. Morgan and the like \u2014 they went and they raised billions of dollars from investors and they invested in these fracking companies, in Chesapeake Energy and all these others popped up, and we were awash with oil! And the next thing you read is that we have too much oil! Because it\u2019s a commodity! Because if you put $100 Billion into anything, you invent something new! So for you to be a \u2014 this is why being a cynic and being a pessimist about technology is generally a losing trade, because you\u2019re assuming that human beings won\u2019t invent anything new and have no capability to do it different!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [54:53]: And this has its roots in what I would say is kind of the Malthusian fallacy. Where he said, We\u2019re gonna run out of food, there\u2019s gonna be mass starvation! And it just fails to take into account the non-linearities associated with innovation! When we get our back against the wall so to speak, we get smarter, we figure out new ways of extracting new resources or growing food. And it\u2019s impossible to project that! You don\u2019t know when those breakthroughs are coming but when they do come, it releases a lot of energy. It releases a lot of productivity.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [55:29]: Yeah Malthus is the iconic example of just being utterly wrong over and over and over again! And if you study the history of science, the history of science is very simple: the non-scientist and non-believers that will tell you why it\u2019s impossible, and then the creative, innovative scientist who thought, I\u2019m gonna ignore that\u2014and just go try it. And 99% of the population generally will just tell you why it\u2019s impossible and be cynical and be critical and they\u2019re fearful. And the 1% will say, I think I\u2019ll just go try it! And of course the 1% is generally right! I mean, they\u2019re wrong until they\u2019re right! The technology fails until it succeeds. But if they just keep trying, the likelihood that you\u2019ll invent electricity or airplanes or antibiotics or better techniques for agriculture or mobile phones or YouTube\u2014the likelihood is high! It is highly likely that someone in the future will come up with a way to extract all the energy that you\u2019re ever gonna need from some element the size of a sugar cube. We don\u2019t have it yet, and I can probably find a million conventional thinkers that\u2019ll tell us why it\u2019s impossible. The same guys that told John Harrison he couldn\u2019t discover longitude with a clock, and the same guys that told the Wright brothers they couldn\u2019t fly! It would be those same guys\u2014and they\u2019ll be right until they\u2019re wrong! And in this particular case, that\u2019s a good thing! That\u2019s a good thing if what you want is abundance. But that\u2019s why it\u2019s a crippling intellectual mistake to run a monetary standard on a commodity that can be produced by man! Ultimately, you have to run a monetary system on math, right? As you pointed out before \u2014 mathematical money \u2014 because 2 + 2 = 4, and as long as 2 + 2 = 4, human ingenuity is not the enemy! And this is a basic sociological principle, really, which is: do you want to design a system assuming that people are stupid and will not evolve and cannot defeat it? Or do you want to design a system assuming people are smart and channel the energy of human ingenuity into making the system work better? And this is why gold is defective! And why a decentralized crypto network of which Bitcoin is the most successful in the history of the world \u2014 that\u2019s why it is effective, because Bitcoin is channeling human ingenuity into making it better! And every commodity is channeling human ingenuity into making it worse, as a money! So if we come back to this idea, Bitcoin is the ultimate energy network! Well we\u2019re gonna bleed 99.5% of our energy on a fiat network. We\u2019re going to bleed 95% or more of our energy on a gold network. Once you calculate the fully diluted Bitcoin count \u2014 21,999,999.98, as I heard from Andreas the other day, that number just slightly less than 21 Million \u2014 once you\u2019ve done that, then you just realize that it\u2019s a lossless monetary energy system through time. Through space, it has a slight loss in the form of transaction fees, but it\u2019s a good thing, and the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are like a little bit of impedance and/or a little bit of gravity, a little bit of friction. And the goddess of wisdom that created the universe gave us a little bit of friction \u2014 it\u2019s a good thing! No gravity, no friction \u2014 your life gets really really complicated!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: No resistance, no growth!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor [1:00:09]: And so there\u2019s nothing wrong with just a slight bit of friction. That\u2019s why the idea that I\u2019ve gotta drive transaction fees to zero is a silly idea! It\u2019s like, No! What we want to do is drive inflation or the loss of energy over time to zero, and then we want there to be a slight loss of energy when we reorganize all of the monetary energy. When I send $100 Million from New York to Tokyo, I don\u2019t mind spending $5. I probably won\u2019t mind spending $50! When Bitcoin has $250 Trillion of energy into it, there\u2019s no reason why you can\u2019t pay $25 Billion in transaction fees! People forget \u2014 again \u2014 this is the problem of the crypto community: they\u2019re fixated upon a prototypical coin network that\u2019s a lab experiment, and they\u2019re comparing it to Bitcoin, instead of comparing Bitcoin to actual monetary or asset networks in the real world! So for example here\u2019s a real asset network: it\u2019s called real estate! I have $100 Trillion of real estate. You have a house. Let\u2019s say you have a $1 Million house. You wanna hold \u2014 this is a good example \u2014 let\u2019s assume that real estate is my energy network! If you wanna actually carry a $1 Million house 100 years \u2014 in Florida, there\u2019s a 2% real estate tax. You would pay $20,000 a year every year for 100 years, assuming that the house was capped and not reappraised, and so you\u2019re in essence going to lose the house in 50 years! Right? Under the best of circumstances! You\u2019re gonna lose all your wealth in about 20 years if you store your wealth or your monetary energy in a real estate network in Florida. So if you go to any other real estate jurisdiction, they\u2019ve all got different tax rates over time, but this is why you can\u2019t really store energy in property, because the tax rate generally will bleed you out in somewhere between 20-100 years. Now that\u2019s the inflation rate, or the energy loss rate over time. What about over space? What if you wanted to transfer a $100 Million house? What if I want to buy it from you? So you want to exchange \u2014 heat exchange, energy exchange \u2014 you want to exchange the energy in the house? Well it\u2019s a 6% transaction fee, and at the point that I said, Robert I want to buy your house, I\u2019ll give you $1 Million bucks for it. How many days \u2018till closing? 30? Probably 30! Okay, so you just paid $60,000 and waited a month in order to do your transaction! Now compare that to Bitcoin again? 30 minutes? $6 bucks? 30 days, $60,000! This is why we don\u2019t use property as an energy network! By the way, some people do! You can ask people point blank, How are you gonna actually give your money to your granddaughter? Well I\u2019m gonna buy property. But it where? California? Florida? Where? It\u2019s the same counterparty risk! It\u2019s worse than gold! You can move 3,000 lbs of gold in 30 days for $150,000-$200,000! You can\u2019t move $100 Million worth of property in 30 days to another country!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [1:04:22]: And you\u2019re also taking the counterparty risk again. The other thing with property is that it\u2019s non-fungible, so the liquidity of the market is much smaller than say gold or Bitcoin. And you run the risk of that area having some natural disaster or some other event that makes it uninhabitable or unappealing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylor: It\u2019s illiquid right? It could take you 3 years to sell the house!"}
{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove [1:10:02]: Right! I think that\u2019s a great point too that you bring up the transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are set at fair market value. It is a freely competitive industry such that all of the transaction fees are a consensual exchange, and the value paid in those transaction fees goes \u2014 with very little loss \u2014 directly to supporting the security of the network! Whereas ostensibly these government fees\u2014they\u2019re non-consensual, they\u2019re conducted under a monopolized area. A lot of that value being extracted \u2014 10% in, 10% out \u2014 is not going to securing the property rights that you\u2019re bringing in and out! It\u2019s a very small piece of that! Most of it\u2019s going into the political coffers!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Saylors [1:10:50]: And politicians, they don\u2019t even hide that. They\u2019ll say, We just decided to tax this in order to pay for something unrelated."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [04:44]: My impression was: I was surprised at how much enthusiasm there is! We started in August, we were the first public company to make a serious commitment, and then Square followed us, and then Marathon Patent did a pretty big Bitcoin acquisition for their balance sheet a few weeks ago, $150 Million. And then when Tesla did, we\u2019ve now got four public companies in a row that have all made pretty material commitments! Of course, the market\u2019s been enthusiastic! Generally, the market\u2019s been very supportive of all the Bitcoin companies. If you look at Square\u2019s stock, PayPal\u2019s stock, Riot Blockchain\u2019s stock, Marathon\u2019s stock, Microstrategy\u2019s been well treated, I think Tesla of course is the most successful stock of the year. We\u2019ve checked off one question, which was, How will public shareholders view this? And there was some trepidation, and in fact they\u2019ve viewed it enthusiastically! For example, since Marathon did their $150 Million Bitcoin acquisition, their stock doubled! If you\u2019re wondering how the public shareholders will view it, oftentimes the thing that holds back public companies from doing something is their concern about how it will be perceived by their outside shareholders. And because it\u2019s very difficult to meet with outside shareholders \u2014 they\u2019re changing every minute of the day between 9:30 and 4:00 PM, right? Your shareholder base is changing! So it\u2019s like trying to grab onto a whirlpool in the middle of an ocean! You can\u2019t quite get your hands around it \u2014 it\u2019s dynamic! That\u2019s a challenge, but as we came in the conference I thought\u2014first of all, there\u2019s a lot of demand bubbling up! We had a lot of people asking us! A lot of people asking us, How\u2019d you do this? What should we do? There\u2019s illegal issues, regulatory issues, where you trip the 1940 Act, are you gonna need an ETF, what\u2019s the accounting treatment for it, what\u2019s the appropriate corporation governance? You know, rather than try to have one meeting at a time \u2014 Saifedean, you realize at some point, if you had 40 hours of meetings a week for the next 30 years, well that\u2019s like 2,000 times 30, right? What is that, 6,000? You can touch 6,000 people in 30 years! You just can\u2019t go fast enough! So you can\u2019t do these one at a time. So we thought, let\u2019s just go ahead and add it as a track to Microstrategy World, which was all virtual, and I thought \u2014 by the way, Microstrategy World last year was 2,500 of our customers in a room and it cost us $4 Million, and it cost them probably another $6 Million, so we spend $10 Million in 2019 to put 2,500 customers into a convention center. This year\u2019s Microstrategy World, we probably spent 1/15th that much money, our customers spent nothing, so we spent probably 1/30th! We reduced our travel and entertainment and event budget by 97%! We reduced all of our travel and events budget by 98% year over year, if you want an interesting factoid \u2014 98%! So Microstrategy World was pulled off for 97% less money, we had 21,000 people registered instead of 2,500. We thought, We\u2019ll tack on Bitcoin for Corporations as an afterthought. I thought, Well if we get 800 that\u2019ll be good! Then I thought, Well we\u2019ll probably get 1,000. Then I thought, Well we\u2019ll get 2,000! And I went on television and I said, Well I think we\u2019ll get 2,000, and then we had this surge, and the day of the event \u2014 no joke, it broke the Internet! Like it actually broke our video server, and the stress was, we blew through 15,000 people and I was on the phone with my IT people saying, Get more capacity from our vendor! And for like an hour or two hours in the morning leading up to the noon thing we were like maxed out and I was worried! So some enterprising cyber hornets \u2014 I love the Bitcoiners, they\u2019re so enterprising! \u2014 while I\u2019m trying to solve the problem the conventional way, someone turns on livestreaming to YouTube, and they set up bootleg live streaming channels that have thousands of people on them! When we finally got to the noon session with Ross \u2014 who you introduced me to by the way I think, thank you!\u2014 so we got to the noon session with Ross and we had 8,500 come into that session, so I thought I\u2019d have 2,000 and we went to 8,500! I thought I\u2019d have 1,500 companies represented, and it was actually 7,000 companies represented in the live session! And then the live session got bootlegged out and posted on YouTube, went viral, I think we\u2019re up to 250,000 views now! [09:58] So I guess the summary would be: exceeded my expectations! And we had people from Space X there, you know, some of Elon Musk\u2019s companies, we had people from Marathon there. The ones you would expect were there, but of course there\u2019s an avalanche of private companies, and there were a decent number of public companies and treasurers and CFO\u2019s that were lurking. Some of them don\u2019t want to have their names mentioned as you can imagine, because it\u2019s a sensitive topic, right? It\u2019s material for a company! But I think we can call it a success, because on television for the past few days, we\u2019ve had the CEO of GM asked if he\u2019s gonna invest in Bitcoin, we\u2019ve had the CFO of Twitter asked about Bitcoin, we\u2019ve had the CEO of Uber asked about Bitcoin! We just had the Miami, Francis Suarez, announce that they\u2019re moving forward to put Bitcoin on their balance sheet, and it\u2019s become part of the conversation, even to the extent that now people are grappling with the accounting and the volatility issues, which I account to be an incredible success for all of us! Because a year ago, no one would have even discussed this! This morning we had a milestone: in the CFO section of the Wall Street Journal, the challenges of incorporating Bitcoin on the balance sheet for CFOs was discussed in an article, and I think that\u2019s the first time that the Wall Street Journal in the CFO section had ever actually brought up the topic of Bitcoin! So the implication is: it\u2019s in the conversation everywhere! And increasingly, people have to come to terms with why they\u2019re not doing it. And there will be technical reasons \u2014 Oh! It\u2019s volatile, right? I mean, it\u2019s going up 200% a year, but it\u2019s going up, it\u2019s making us large sums of money in a volatile fashion, that\u2019s a technical reason. If you\u2019re an investor and your reason for not investing in something is, It\u2019s making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion \u2014 I\u2019m not even gonna say what I think of that! It\u2019s quite amusing to me! [12:14] But if I had to be criticized, I think I\u2019d like to be criticized for making money too fast in an unpredictable fashion! And then they\u2019re grappling with the accounting issues, because if you hold it as the underlying asset, it\u2019s currently accounted for as an intangible on the balance sheet, which is the most conservative way. Kind of like the way you\u2019d account for patents or things like that. You know, if you hold it as a fund, then it may, under certain circumstances, be accounted for as an investment asset. But then if you have a fund, it\u2019s a security! And if you hold the asset, it\u2019s property and a commodity! And if you have a lot of securities, at some point you might trip the SEC 1940 Act and become a finance company, because you have more than 40% of your assets as securities. There are a lot of nuances and people are grappling with them, but they\u2019re good debates, right? Good discussions to be having right now! And a year ago, no one would have even considered these matters! So we have injected this into the conversation I think around the world, and I think the Bitcoin conference was part of it. Clearly the Tesla purchase was helpful! And I think February 8th, you could call Mainstream Day, Saifedean! February 8th, this year, was the date when the entire story of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset crossed outside of the Bitcoin and the Crypto community, and it was in the Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The Irish News, The Straits Times \u2014 every major financial publication everywhere in the world, and all the mainstream media! I got invited the next day to go on CNBC, Bloomberg, FOX, CNN, NPR! And I\u2019m like, No more! I can\u2019t do any more! But the point is, CNN, NPR \u2014 these are not Bitcoin journalists, these are mainstream sources! So I think the message is exploding into the mainstream \u2014 you could start the clock: February 8th was the day the shot was heard around the world! And that, combined with the Bitcoin for Corporations Summit, placed this in the public domain. The beauty now of course it, I used to meet with 100 people, and I could meet with 10 a week, and then we met with 8,000 people, and then it went viral to 250,000 people, and now we\u2019ve published our Bitcoin Playbook, and that\u2019s out there circulating amongst lawyers and accountants and advisors and investors, and we just let that percolate and I think good things will happen!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [15:01]: Absolutely! I was going to say the exact thing that you mentioned which is: one year ago, none of this was going on anywhere! Nobody was talking about any of this stuff! I remember exactly it was one year ago, it was a conference, and I was with somebody who works in a Bitcoin company \u2014 they were talking about some blockchain nonsense \u2014 and I was telling them that the case for corporations really is: hold a small part of your balance sheet in Bitcoin! And especially if you\u2019re operating internationally, it will help you get around banking closures and it\u2019ll protect you from inflation also! The response I used to get when I\u2019d mention this to people was always, No! It\u2019s too volatile! And the accounting would be too much of a headache! There\u2019s no way anybody would do it! And it\u2019s incredible, and it\u2019s almost entirely down to you, how the conversation\u2019s entirely shifted in a year now to the point where we have a complete playbook that the lawyers and accountants can just go to microstrategy.com, download your corporate playbook, and they have the complete guide to how they need to answer those questions, and we\u2019ve already had thousands of them show up! So I think I can\u2019t but commend you for your incredible service to the cause! And this unbelievable contribution of just putting this out there and forcing it upon people! People call it speculation and people say, Well people are just speculating! But I think ultimately, every economic decision is speculation, and maybe the reason this speculation is paying off is because it is a better economic decision! Maybe it\u2019s just that it\u2019s a better asset on the balance sheet and the world is discovering that!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [16:31]: Yeah! I mean, clearly words can be prejudicial, as we\u2019ve talked about before, if I kicked you into the ocean and I threw a life raft next to you, it wouldn\u2019t be a speculation to put on the life vest or crawl onto the life raft! If you were walking through the desert and about to [die of thirst] then I dropped a water bottle that was sealed from a brand that you\u2019d never purchased in a supermarket before, it wouldn\u2019t be a speculation to crack open the water bottle and drink the water! And if you lived in Argentina and the currency was crashing and you had pesos and you had the opportunity to buy a tangible asset or convert your money to dollars, I don\u2019t think it would be a speculation \u2014 I think it would be rational, right? If I kicked you out of an airplane and you had a parachute, it wouldn\u2019t be a speculation to pull the rip cord either! It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s only speculation when you don\u2019t understand the engineering or the science behind the thing! Then it\u2019s speculation! You could say it was speculation for Amazon to use the Internet to sell books.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [17:49]: And it\u2019s speculation for people to buy Amazon stock as well!

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [25:16]: Like isn\u2019t it a once a decade type thing?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Germany did it recently: a lot of millions of dollars to send it when they repatriated their gold from the Fed. I can\u2019t remember how much it cost, but it was in the tens of millions of dollars I think, and it took years to move Germany\u2019s gold! So it\u2019s very slow compared to Bitcoin!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [25:35]: People that criticize Bitcoin for being slow, they\u2019re running these lab experiments in a garage on their little altcoin moving no money around! And it\u2019s kind of like criticizing someone running a power reactor when you\u2019ve got a lighter in your hand, you know? Like, it\u2019s totally unrelated! It\u2019s silly! If you\u2019re gonna compare the speed and the efficiency of Bitcoin, you have to compare it to the gold network, because you need to have final settlement on $1 Billion of money, of tangible property! And you\u2019re not really getting $1 Billion of settlement on a fiat network without so many other things. So I guess my point is: we have something that\u2019s gonna last a lot longer \u2014 it\u2019s harder. And then we have something which moves faster, so you create the potential of high-frequency structures which are inconceivable! Like a bank that actually makes $1 Billion loans and moves the money tangibly every day, every hour, every minute! There are certain structures people can\u2019t conceive of because they never thought about being able to tangibly move $1 Billion of monetary energy in 37 minutes and then move it back! In the crypto world they\u2019ve got this idea of flash loans, maybe that\u2019s the closest thing? I don\u2019t know how enamored I am of a flash loan that lasts for like 400 milliseconds? I don\u2019t know! It seems to me to be interesting but cute \u2014 maybe a little bit more gimmicky? I can definitely see the application of a loan that lasts 87 days! Or 31 days! Or maybe moving a block of money for 187 days! If I can do it with two institutional counterparties without the banks in the middle and the governments in the middle \u2014 and we\u2019ll get to this in a second, this fiat issue \u2014 that opens up a new world! You could imagine in like 1600 in Renaissance Europe, they\u2019re building buildings with masonry and they\u2019re 5 stories high and someone says, You know one day we\u2019ll have steel and we\u2019re gonna build 100-story skyscrapers and they\u2019ll be shaped differently! You know? And the architects couldn\u2019t even conceive of that because they didn\u2019t have a material strong enough. I don\u2019t think people can conceive of the kind of banks or the kind of institutions that we\u2019ll have with high-frequency money! And I think this last issue is that money progresses from dumber to smarter. Humans are able to create more complex structures and they\u2019re working against entropy \u2014 complexity? Maybe entropy is the word! So we\u2019re either working against time \u2014 we gotta be harder, we\u2019re working against space \u2014 we gotta be faster, we\u2019re working against entropy \u2014 we gotta be smarter! And the material is the semiconductor chip to make us smarter combined with Bitcoin, and the material is the network to make us faster combined with Bitcoin. I mean Bitcoin is basically sitting on the network on the chip getting harder, faster, smarter, and the conclusion you come to is: just like architecture, where I can break the laws of gravity \u2014 what does steel give us? It didn\u2019t just give us 50\u2013100 story buildings! It also gave us cantilevers and it also gave us bridges, right? And Carnegie made all his money by the way \u2014 I read his biography \u2014 his big customers were municipalities buying iron and steel for bridges! Bridges are a pretty big deal! Actually, you could make the argument: bridges may be even more important to civilization than skyscrapers! I mean, knock out the bridges in Manhattan and everybody starves to death! You ever see in a bridge \u2014 the bridge that connects San Francisco and Oakland, or the Bay bridge that connects the eastern shore of Maryland to D.C. \u2014 with the bridge it\u2019s a 1-hour commute. Without the bridge it\u2019s a 12-hour commute! Or it\u2019s an 18-hour drive! In one case I drive to work, in the other case, I don\u2019t! Right? It ends the civilization! So I think this element of money \u2014 I think you put your finger on something very fascinating, which is: as the money gets harder, we can see further into the future with our institutions! But I think, as it gets smarter and faster, we can construct institutions or relationships that are inconceivable before with slow, soft money! And I would say, that takes us to fiat. Fiat is softer money. It\u2019s faster than a block of gold, but it\u2019s still so much slower and stupider than Bitcoin!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [30:37]: It\u2019s manual! At the end of the day, at least gold is somehow automatic. It\u2019s a machine in a sense \u2014 it has its own truth within it! You can verify it even though it\u2019s a little bit expensive. But with fiat it\u2019s ultimately manual. But today\u2019s use, it is generally faster to move it around than moving around physical gold, but its real drawback as you were saying \u2014 in holding onto value for the future\u2014that\u2019s where it\u2019s really not good and in that sense, the way that I look at it is: the harder the money, the more it incentivizes us to lower our time preference and therefore makes us think more and more about the future, because the harder the money, the less uncertain the future! Because now you have something that\u2014I have this wealth, this monetary energy that I\u2019ve stored \u2014 and I have more certainty in the fact that it\u2019s going to be there in a year or in 2\u20133 years. So 1, 2, 3 years becomes more of a foreseeable thing for me, less of a uncertain thing for me, and so I start discounting less! When I start discounting it less, I start effectively lowering my time preference and providing for the future. And this is why I think the harder got\u2014silver and gold were continuously getting harder and silver was eliminated and gold was hardest\u2014that was the pinnacle of human achievement, arguably! This was when we made the most incredible technology! This was when we invented all these incredible things like the airplane and many, many, many things of the 19th century which I mentioned in The Bitcoin Standard! And I think in the 20th century, maybe we\u2019ve reversed that process because our money is getting easier and so the future is becoming less certain and so we\u2019re becoming more high time preference because we discount the future more!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [32:15]: I agree with that! Yeah I think you\u2019ve put your finger on something there which is: the future gets hazier and you see more anxiety! I mean I know as a corporate CEO, in March \u2014 as I was staring at a block of $500 Million US dollars and I was watching the money supply expand and the dollar devalue, my anxiety went through the roof! My anxiety went up so high that it kind of kicked me out of the fiat standard into the Bitcoin standard, right? Like the boiling frog, or jumping out of the boiling whatever! I mean it literally shocked me! It\u2019s all about engineering a mechanism or engineering a security for yourself, right? I mean, steel allows me to stand on a cantilevered structure a hundred feet over a canyon! Or it allows me to stand on a bridge 1,000 feet over the Hudson River or the East River with security! I can even drive a car over it and steel allows me to stand 800 feet in the air! And you imagine the insecurity of that, taking the structure away! Human beings are able to go to places with engineering. Space stations, right? We\u2019re able to go places with engineering, where otherwise you literally can\u2019t live! Like there\u2019s no life there without the engineering! You know, you got me thinking about the fiat standard and some of the criticisms I\u2019ve heard lately about energy consumption of Bitcoin got me thinking about, Well what\u2019s the comparable system? Again the critics are people that\u2014they have a little toy railroad train in their garage and they think, Well my toy railroad train is more efficient than Bitcoin! But they don\u2019t really contrast the energy consumption of Bitcoin to the energy consumption of the alternative system that it is replacing! So if you look at the fiat system, money\u2019s gotta do two things: it\u2019s gotta be a medium of exchange and a store of value, and Bitcoin kind of is one structure and the fiat is another structure. So I look at the current system and I think, Well to make this work, when we replace the gold standard \u2014 I mean the gold standard in its \u2014 when commodity money reaches its pinnacle I suppose after all the shuffling around we eventually arrived at gold coins and silver coins! And gold in my opinion is store of value, and silver is the medium of exchange! You know, one of them was the day-to-day currency! A gold coin was like 8 grams, a quarter of an ounce? Feels like it\u2019s about a $500 coin? And so the gold coin is about 1 weeks salary for a laborer, and you wouldn\u2019t have used a $500 or $1,000 coin to pay for things routinely, but if I gave you a stack of ten of them, that\u2019s your treasury! So the silver coin is the medium of exchange, and in that standard you\u2019ve got a very clean structure! Gold coin, silver coin, you mine the gold, you mine the silver, you mint the gold, you mint the silver, you store the gold, you store the silver, they all circulate around! And eventually maybe they\u2019re gold notes, right? Maybe some notes that are fractional or fully reserve-banked \u2014 moving that around. [35:51] When we went to the fiat standard, we replaced that with\u2014the Treaty of Genoa got me thinking about this, Saifedean! \u2014 we replaced this with diplomats, corporations, accountants, lawyers, programmers, security guards, contractors, buildings, armies, software, mints \u2014 we kept the mints, we kept the printers, we kept the gold mines, we kept the vaults, and then we tacked on ideas like ETFs, bond indexes, bond funds, financial managers, and everything else around them, in order to create a medium of exchange and a store of value! I\u2019m trying to figure out how much energy is consumed by\u2014what is it, like 100,000 bank buildings? J.P. Morgan has 200,000 people, so I\u2019m guessing there must be in the finance industry around the world\u2014in the US it\u2019s like 8 Million \u2014 so half of the finance industry is tied up in store of value medium of exchange! So if we could figure it out it\u2019d probably be like 40 Million people in the world! Maybe it\u2019s 20\u201340 Million people! So what\u2019s the carbon footprint and the building footprint and the concrete footprint and the steel footprint and the electricity consumption of \u2014 and I was kind of kind \u2014 I\u2019m not really allocating all the armies and the like, but you could probably say, if you really wanted to keep track of the real cost of the system \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [37:28]: But you\u2019ve gotta include the proof of work system so you\u2019ve gotta put in the military!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Yeah I mean, the first cost of the system is probably 20\u201330 Million bankers and financial advisors and the like! That\u2019s the primary cost! The secondary cost is all the government infrastructure, the diplomats and the military officials and the aircraft carriers and the armies and the back and forth! I guess the third cost is actually the wars themselves that get waged back and forth! And then I think the fourth cost \u2014 the pernicious cost \u2014 I guess is the inflation! If we\u2019re burning \u2014 you said 7\u20138% was the monetary inflation on average \u2014 if there\u2019s $500 Trillion of monetary assets and you\u2019re debasing 5% of it a year, even, that\u2019s $25 Trillion! So I dunno \u2014 $50 Trillion a year? It must be $50 Trillion! If we could somehow calculate that number \u2014 I mean if you really wanna do something useful \u2014 calculate the cost of the infrastructure, the banking infrastructure, then the governmental infrastructure, and then the first order cost of the currency debasement and the second order impact on the currency derivatives \u2014 the stocks, the bonds, and the real estate! And then after you\u2019ve done that you could throw in the business insolvency and the destruction of good enterprises and the political insolvency \u2014 destruction of good countries, right? The inefficiency of the system results in the destruction of entire countries! I guess the best example being like the meltdown of the Weimar Republic due to the Treaty of Versailles, which was I think largely the result of poor treatment of debt and, following World War I, I mean they pretty much crashed that entire political system because of the way they layered the debt asymmetrically on the Germans and not on the French and the Americans! We know how that one ended! Which wasn\u2019t good for anybody! I think we can see, in the 20th century, we see an example of lots of countries destroyed by the fiat standard. I\u2019m sensitive to all the companies destroyed by the fiat standard as well! The example of that is: as they keep cranking up the monetary expansion rate and as CEOs keep attempting to have their stock hold value, the only way the stock can hold value is to expand the cash flows per share faster than the rate of money expansion! And that means that in an environment where the money\u2019s expanding at 7% a year, if your company\u2019s growing at 3% a year, you can\u2019t store value in the stock, and the political pressure to hold value in the stock causes you to take on massive debt, and then the massive debt is used to either issue dividends or buy the stock back, and so what you\u2019re doing is you\u2019ve taken on $1 Billion of liabilities to actually pump the stock up and then you\u2019re impoverishing the company! Eventually you end up with the company having billions of dollars in debt and no equity, and then when you hit a crisis \u2014 like a technology crisis like Amazon attacks Toys \u201cR\u201d Us while they are insolvent \u2014 or you have a pandemic crisis and they shut down your restaurant and you\u2019re insolvent! So the crises create insolvencies because the companies are undercapitalized because they took on debt under political pressure to keep their stock up! And you could see that playing out even right now, where the majority of CFOs \u2014 like we just saw, I\u2019m not gonna name the CFOs \u2014 but the majority of CEOs and CFOs will say, We\u2019re gonna take our cash and buy our stock back, and conventional financial thinking is: Reward CEOs and CFOs for buying stocks back and issuing dividends, and criticize them for buying Bitcoin or tangible assets with their cash flows! Like, I would be criticized as a speculator taking risks with my balance sheet even though today I have $3.2 Billion of tangible assets on my balance sheet! A year ago I had $500 Million, right? And conventional wisdom is, You should give away the $500 Million and have zero! So conventional thinking is: decapitalize the company! And you\u2019re really ostracized or criticized if you convert cash from a weak asset to a strong asset! Primarily by conventional thinking. I know I said a lot, and I threw a lot out there but I should pause and we should just talk about it because I think there\u2019s a lot of interesting implications and they start with this idea of the fiat system and the fiat standard!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [42:51]: Yeah! That is great! Thank you for that! The cost of the fiat standard is all the things that you mentioned. There\u2019s also the business cycle which is constantly causing misallocation of capital and causes businesses to make malinvestments which get wiped out all the time! And then there\u2019s the fact that \u2014 and this is primarily outside the US , it\u2019s a much bigger problem elsewhere\u2014 which is that you have the countries pay its balances, all of their international account and their current account, all of it is settled with the central bank\u2019s cash balance, which is also used to back people\u2019s deposits in the banking system, and it is also used to buy government bonds, so essentially just financing government bonds. [43:41] And it backs the national currency. So you\u2019re constantly putting all of society\u2019s savings and all of the society\u2019s ability to trade with the outside world essentially as collateral for government to borrow against! And of course, government has high time preference incentives to continue to abuse this all the time, and so it ends up creating all kinds of destruction of savings and destruction of capital. I think that\u2019s really \u2014 well it\u2019s hard to estimate which is the biggest \u2014 but if you think about a century of misallocation of capital, when you think about, How much capital was misallocated? And, How much capital was essentially leaked away from prudent, productive people who have put it away to finance their future and then suddenly saw it go Poof! because their central bank had printed it! And all of that went to finance wasteful government spending and war and investment in things that were not chosen on the market! If you think about the opportunity cost of that over a century, I think the world would be a very different place! And I don\u2019t necessarily have to speculate about technological achievements that we haven\u2019t made, but I think with the things that we have, owning a house with 24-hour electricity and running water is probably something that would be attainable for everybody in the world if money was hard! If you think about it, anybody, particularly people in the poorest country in the world, if they had had gold for the last century, it would be almost trivial for people to be able to secure a modern house with electricity and running hot water as a basic infrastructure! I think the upside of where we would be is almost unimaginable for people in our position! [45:29] But I think the bare minimum would be that: basic technology would be far cheaper all over the world and far more easily available because people could afford them! It\u2019s not that expensive to build an engine that gives you 24-hour electricity! It\u2019s a really simple engineering problem that\u2019s been solved in many places in the world for many many decades. And it just keeps getting cheaper every year! I think the reason that so many people in the world don\u2019t have it is because they have bad money that just continues to lose value. And it ruins their time preference as we were saying earlier! It prevents them from thinking of the future."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [46:03]: One thing that\u2019s interesting to me is: in the perfect gold standard, the store of value is a gold coin and the medium of exchange is the silver coin. As I read The Fiat Standard, I see we kind of had to abandon the gold standard because we needed faster money and we needed larger quantities of it! You know, we replaced the gold standard with this network of tens of thousands of banks and hundreds of central banks and armies of accountants and lawyers and bureaucrats! The currency was the medium of exchange, the store of value when the fiat system worked \u2014 first they tried the store of value as gold \u2014 it seems like they layered on fiat currency over gold to try to do that, and then over time as the gold got seized and it was synthetic gold or hypothecated gold, and then in 1971 the semblance of that started breaking down and then the store of value in the fiat system was sovereign debt! If we look at the world today, there\u2019s all the currency, and the theoretical store of value, right? If you ask a corporate treasurer, What are you gonna do with your treasury, I need to store my value? Well I don\u2019t hold my cash outright, I would hold it in government debt \u2014 treasuries were the gold. The gold standard is treasuries! And that kind of worked! For example, the currency system \u2014 international currency trading \u2014 used to kind of work! There was price discovery in the market! For example, you remember when Greek debt was trading like 8, 9, 10%, and I remember Spanish debt or Italian debt used to trade 5\u20136%. I would say if you go back to before the EU was formed and you had all these countries with all their different currencies, the currencies were in a competitive market, and if a country wanted to keep its currency from collapsing, you had to raise the interest rate! So you remember when people used to have 12% interest rates and 8% \u2014 under the Volcker regime, we go back to the \u201980s: you had Ronald Reagan \u2014 he was fairly conservative, Volcker was conservative. There you had the fiat standard, but they took the interest rates to 18% in the US! The thinking was, countries had to compete to make the currency viable: you had to have interest rates that were market-set, and in that world you have 8% 30-year bonds and you had 5% bonds. In 2010, short-term interest rates were 5%! So you remember you were saying, Well the money supply was expanding at 7\u20138%, maybe 7% or something! In that world, if I\u2019m a corporate treasurer, I can get 5\u20136% on bonds. Call it credit-worthy bonds, AAA credit. The store of value in the fiat system, when it works \u2014 and we\u2019ll go back to good ole days, Ronald Reagan when it was the good ole days \u2014 when it works you buy credit-grade bonds, AAA-rated, you buy sovereign debt, it yields 4, 5, 6%, the money supply expands either 3% or 7%, say it\u2019s expanding at 7\u20138%, you\u2019re getting a 1\u20132% loss, I give you $100 Million \u2014 the half-life of the money is 35 years! So in that world, you can have \u2014 by the way, 35 years or 30 years is kind of a magic number, it\u2019s your career, Saifedean \u2014 so if I\u2019m a CEO or I\u2019m a corporate treasurer and I\u2019m running on the fiat standard in that time period, I can take my capital, I can put it into like credit-worthy bonds, not take a lot of execution risk, not try to guess what happens with Zoom versus Tesla and I\u2019m not \u201cspeculating,\u201d right? The fiat standard, when it works, gives you sovereign debt and credit instruments that allow me as a responsible corporate treasurer to protect the assets of the company for the next 20\u201330 years, long enough for the company to execute its business strategy. That used to work! But then something started breaking down in the last 30 years! And today it\u2019s busted! There\u2019s no price discovery, sovereign debt is not a store of value! Last week the junk bond index dipped below 5%, it was 4.9%! Okay? The theoretical risk of junk bonds, the risk of default to anybody is 4%, but to a rational person it feels like it\u2019s 8%! It\u2019s 4\u20138%, is the risk on the bond, which means that if you\u2019re getting 4% yield, you\u2019re at best zero and at worst, it\u2019s a negative real yield of 4% or something after credit adjustment! So that tells you that corporate bonds, sovereign debt, and junk bonds are no longer stores of value. And the currencies yield no interest! The US 30-year swap was 72 basis points a year ago. Today, it\u2019s 175\u2013180 basis points! And that\u2019s the best you\u2019re gonna get! [51:34] The EU 30-year swap is 20 basis points. It\u2019s nothing! There\u2019s no yield! So what can you say? You can say: the fiat standard has broken down starting the year 2020, because at this point there is no tangible store of value where all the traditional treasury instruments are no longer stores of value! Now, when did it start? And I\u2019m going over this in my head \u2014 forgive me, I read your book, you got me thinking, I\u2019m literally thinking about this this morning but I\u2019m thinking \u2014 I\u2019m thinking it started to break down with the Japanese in 1980s. I think the Japanese had a crisis, the crisis was: the digital revolution, computer chip came out, Intel, Microsoft \u2014 the Japanese dominate analog electronics, the world shifts to digital electronics, their exports start slipping, and as the world moves to the Computer Age, the Japanese economy weakens. Their reaction is: the central bank starts to intervene. They\u2019re a closed system and authoritarian, a single government in a closed system under economic crisis. And so they start buying everything, price discovery disappears, asset inflation goes through the roof, real estate in Tokyo goes through the roof, zombie companies start to manifest themselves, the economy freezes! And that\u2019s the first place you start to see the breakdown of the fiat standard! The interest rate goes to laughable numbers! Non-competitive, and it\u2019s like this self-referential closed system \u2014 it doesn\u2019t make any sense whatsoever! And America looks at it and in America we have 18% interest rates, you know? And so the Japanese response was central bank intervention, and they were the first major country. Maybe not the first, because I\u2019m not a student of China and every other country. I just noticed in Japan. Then what happens next, America has the Reagan revolution and so Reagan and Volcker really define the game plan until 1988. And we have the fiat system lurching toward normal \u2014 you had savings accounts that yield 6, 7, 8% interest! You know, the way you know that there\u2019s a semblance of normalcy is: checking accounts yield 0% and savings accounts yield 8% interest and the banking system offers those things! You know, a savings account allows me to save money! If the money supply\u2019s debasing at 7% a year, the savings account is yielding 7% interest, there\u2019s some hope! When I was a kid, there was hope! And then Clinton came in and Clinton inherited a great economy and Microsoft\u2019s killing it and there\u2019s the Internet revolution and Google and Apple \u2014 this is the rise of America and all of a sudden we thought the Japanese were gonna own everything in America! They were buying the Rockefeller Center, Sony was crushing everybody, etc. So we lurched in 1980, an inflection point! America got its mojo back and we thought technology and the Internet \u2014 that makes us leaders! We didn\u2019t think we were world economic leaders when Reagan was elected! I mean, people really thought the Japanese, they were setting up Toyota plants, there\u2019s a movie Gung Ho \u2014 we thought we were gonna be working for the Japanese! [54:54] The world took a left turn, the Japanese economy missed the digital revolution, and I think this is deep-seated in the Japanese language. It\u2019s a pictographic language, that they didn\u2019t have the programming skills. They missed the digital revolution! America started to rise, the rise of Western Europe, the US started to prosper from digital productivity. And Clinton inherited this very healthy economy from Reagan, and Clinton was kind of a moderate. And we went on to 2000. And what happens in 2000? The EU! And before the EU you had all these different currencies and when you crossed Europe, every currency had to have its own interest rate and its own bank, and they\u2019re competitive with each other! And if a currency prints too much, their currency crashes and no one\u2019s gonna save them! And so there are interest rates! Go look at the interest rates \u2014 they\u2019re real interest rates! It was like a 7%, a 6%, an 8%! Right? There are consequences to irrationality under the fiat standard when there\u2019s 100 central banks and they\u2019re all competing! And you talked about it in your book: there\u2019s all these central banks! The US as a currency swap was \u2014 it wasn\u2019t 87% or 90% of all currency \u2014 it was like 30%! You can see this manifest itself in 1980, because when you had different currency systems \u2014 the Chinese, the Japanese, the Indian, South America, the German bank, the U.K., the French, the US \u2014 they\u2019re all different currency systems. And the US had to raise their interest rates, and there are consequences to our inflation! We had to take our interest rates to 18\u201319% to actually fix that problem! We couldn\u2019t print money with impunity! It\u2019s like pissing in your own bath tub! It\u2019s a small bath tub, and there are consequences to foiling your own bath tub, but when it\u2019s a big ocean, there are no consequences and you feel like you can \u2014 if you print $1 Trillion in a $10 Trillion economy that\u2019s a problem. And if you print $1 Trillion in a $50 Trillion global economy that\u2019s 2%, right? That just goes away! So in 1980, you couldn\u2019t do it! And we started lurching toward globalism, and then the EU was this big change! And what happened? Well the EU came with a light hand, but it was a massive increase in governmental authority and fiat authority. Because now you\u2019ve got an EU central bank! In my opinion, the biggest beneficiary of the EU? When the EU formed, the biggest beneficiary was the US! Because you saw every local country \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [57:46]: Yeah! It limited the ability of Deutsche Mark from competing with the US Dollar I think! It gave the dollar a lease of life, because it tied the Deutsche Mark with weaker European currencies!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Here\u2019s what I saw: when I traveled through Europe in the \u201990s, there were 10 languages \u2014 the menus were in 10 different languages \u2014 10 different currencies, I have to change money at every border, I started with $1,000, I ended with the equivalent of $780 or $900, the money-changing was expensive, and I couldn\u2019t read the street signs! When you travel through Europe after the formation of the EU, all the menus converted to English, EU adopted English as the second language, you converted to the Euro, and if you\u2019re living in Portugal or France or Spain you\u2019re thinking, Well I had to give up Portuguese and Spanish and Italian for English! And I had to give up the peseta and the lira for the Euro, but I might as well just convert it to the dollar! The Italians aren\u2019t gonna adopt French! And so it\u2019s almost like all the Europeans agreed to adopt English, and then they started pegging to the dollar! And the US was the big beneficiary of the formation of the EU, because now everybody had to accept English and the dollar, and that played into TCP/IP and the Internet, and Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, and the entire US economy benefited! And it was US San Francisco progressive views, San Francisco technology, US law. The American legal and economic and cultural system encroached on Europe in a big way! We saw the formation of a Western Europe and the United States, a billion-person trading bloc trading in dollars, convertible dollars trading in English language subject to basically US trade law! So what happened next? Well, the EU was weak, and there was a crisis, and it used to be that, if I wanted to buy Italian bonds I could get 7\u20138% yield, and the German bond yield was 2%. And the Germans had the best credit rating and the French were next, but the Portuguese had a weaker one and the Italians had an awful credit rating and their bonds yielded great! And the Greeks, at some point \u2014 you could probably go back and pull the bond yields, it probably tells the story of the death of the fiat standard, right? Or the encroachment of the fiat standard! If you look at bond yields in European countries from 2000-on, there\u2019s a point at which they all pretty much pegged to the EU bond yield, and that was as the EU central banks started taking responsibility for the default of the Greeks. The Greek crisis was probably a seminal event! [1:00:56] When the EU bailed out Greece, that was an expansion of the EU central bank! I almost think about two crises: we had the Great Financial Crisis, when the United States bailed out every bank, and we forced them all to take hundreds of billions of dollars, and we bailed out every European bank with US dollars! And it seems like once we did that, we owned them all! Like, the US dollar as the world reserve currency, it went from being 30% to 40% to 60% to 80% to 90% after that crisis! And it seems like after the debt crisis of Greece, and after the Italian debt crisis when the EU central bank bailed out those countries, the EU kind of owned them as well! The summary is: by the time this is all said and done, interest rates in the European Union have crashed to zero, short-term interest rates are negative, long-term interest rates were like 8 basis points for 30-year money on a swap a few weeks ago! And so what you really got is the massive expansion of the EU central bank and the Fed from the year 2000 to the year 2020. And as they expanded, all corporate debt, all sovereign debt, stopped being an effective store of value! The currencies became dominant and for whatever reason, the US currency just got progressively stronger and stronger from 1980 to the year 2020! And now the entire transformation has taken its hold!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:02:42]: So I guess what you\u2019re saying is basically: Bitcoin eats the store of value market! So what assets do you see that essentially disrupting? What do we get rid of? Do you think government bonds make sense anymore, or do you see them phased out?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I think that the free market migrated. The death of the savings account forced everybody probably first into bond indexes and then stock indexes. And today, a 22-year old Uber driver knows that the savings account is worthless! If I have cash at some of these bulge bracket banks, you know in their money market funds? They\u2019re actually charging like \u2014 they\u2019re offering 15 basis points yield and charging 25 basis points management fee! The literal fee is higher than the yield on the account! The marketplace has migrated, and it\u2019s being forced. And stage one was gold, stage two was sovereign debt, and then the rise of corporate, AAA-rated debt. You could almost say that in order to replace the gold standard, we had to have an army of credit rating agencies \u2014 Moody\u2019s and S&P and you could say the rise of the junk bond market might be explained by this! \u2014 people desperately chasing after store of value without equity risk. Finally they threw in the towel and they started absorbing some equity risk! And then in 2020, we kind of kicked the thing into high gear, right? March of 2020 is the point where everything just breaks! Like, because 5, 6, 7% money expansion against an 8% S&P index and against a 5% bond yield or 4% credit worthy yield and 8\u201310% junk bond yield \u2014 you can sort of almost make that work, but it stops working when the money supply expands by 25% and the S&P yield is 15% and the junk bond yield is 4%, and the sovereign yield is 0\u20131%!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:06:04]: And arguably, it only worked in the \u201980s and the \u201990s because essentially it was financed by borrowing from the future through manipulated interest rates! And so effectively, it\u2019s not like it was working and now it broke \u2014 it was a short term fix that was inevitably going to break down eventually!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I think right now the only two store of values \u2014 the people are smarter in some ways than the politicians and mainstream media, because even the 23-year old Uber driver knows that they\u2019re probably better off to buy Tesla stock or to buy a market basket of technology stocks, or even take a flyer on GameStop, or buy Bitcoin, than they are to put their money in a savings account and wait! I think that what\u2019s happened is, people have migrated, smart money has determined that there\u2019s only two stores of value left! Really smart money that\u2019s brave says, Bitcoin! If you\u2019re really progressive and if you\u2019ve got some courage, then you realize that the best store of value is Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s digital gold! The other layer of smart money that is either very comfortable \u2014 they\u2019re already wealthy, they\u2019ve got plenty of money and they\u2019re comfortable or they\u2019re conventional \u2014 the comfortable, conventional smart money has decided that Big Tech or growth is the store of value. And the best surrogate for that is NASDAQ. If I go right now case for Bitcoin, and I look, what does that show me? ROI 1-year it\u2019s saying Bitcoin is 356% up, NASDAQ is up 43%, gold is up 14.7%, S&P is up 16%, and treasuries are 2%, and your money expansion was 25% or whatever you want to plug in! And if you plug in 15% going forward you can see you\u2019ll tread water with gold and S&P \u2014 maybe! I wouldn\u2019t [with gold]! I think that you\u2019re more likely to tread water with the S&P. I think with gold, gold is in a ballistic trajectory \u2014 it got a boost in the crisis \u2014 now it\u2019s losing momentum, it\u2019s broken down in the last 6 months and it\u2019s about to crash! And you\u2019re going to see people short gold, reallocate from gold, the price is gonna crash! And it\u2019s probably the scariest possible investment right now, because gold only exists as long as people are looking for a non-sovereign store of value, and you only need one, right? And there\u2019s only one that can be! And you pretty much have to be brain-dead to be allocating to gold versus Bitcoin in the year 2021! You\u2019re just gonna have to go through like mental gymnastics! So I can buy the argument that I buy a market basket of all the stocks, because you\u2019re just buying the economy, but I can\u2019t really buy the argument of gold anymore! And of course, treasuries are disasters because you\u2019re long money \u2014 not only are you taking on cash that\u2019s losing 15% of its purchasing power a year, you\u2019re locking yourself in for 20\u201330 year duration! By the time you get the cash back you\u2019re going to have lost 95% of your money, so that\u2019s just foolish! But you\u2019ve got growth, right? Everybody wants growth! They\u2019ll take growth discounting risk to zero! They\u2019ll even take the prospect of growth, right? Like if you just tell me a story, and if I can\u2019t have growth then they\u2019ll buy GameStop because at least there\u2019s the potential of \u2014 if I can\u2019t have growth, I\u2019ll take speculation of growth, and if I can\u2019t have speculation of growth, I\u2019ll just take speculation of a short squeeze! All of those are more compelling than anything left in the fiat system!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:10:02]: Yeah! And I think Bitcoin becomes more and more compelling over time. Sure, there will definitely be stocks and investing in stocks has its place, but I think for the store of value market, that\u2019s going to distinct from money that you want to risk on high growth, high risk stocks! So the interesting thing will be to see how this develops! Now you\u2019ve been saying that you don\u2019t think Bitcoin threatens the dollar. So would you say that Bitcoin threatens treasuries, but doesn\u2019t threaten the dollar and therefore we can continue to see maybe just more inflation in the dollar, but governments continue turning value against Bitcoin and continue to collect taxes from Bitcoin, so Bitcoin replaces their treasuries, puts them on a tight leash, and makes their inflation a little bit more transparent, but their dollar continues to survive! Is that how you see it?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: We\u2019re headed toward a Quadrillion \u2014 a Quad planet! And Bitcoin will expand at 250%-300% a year\u2014for the last decade \u2014 and that\u2019s about as fast as it can go, because anything faster than that rips the wings off the airplane! People ask, How fast can human beings accept change? I think, if you look at the history of business, companies growing faster than 200% a year are rare! I mean, that\u2019s pretty much as fast as it can go! So it\u2019ll go 200%, and it\u2019ll track that way, and then I think at some point when it crosses gold, it\u2019ll slow down to 150% and 120% \u2014 you could probably work it out over the next 20 years as it goes from a Trillion to $200 Trillion! It might take 30 years. It might take 20 years. It might take 10 years. Somewhere between 10\u201330 years, right? If you look at the rate. And where we\u2019re headed is: a world where there\u2019s 8 billion people on the planet with a mobile phone, and those 8 billion people are storing value in digital gold, and probably that mobile device is gonna have a hardware wallet embedded in it that\u2019s gonna be the token, and you\u2019ll have multi-signature multi-hardware wallets securing digital gold which has become \u2014 I dunno what is it gonna be, a third, or half? \u2014 you have to ask the question theoretically, Saifedean! What portion of the monetary planet should rationally be store of value? And I think it\u2019s self-equibilating, because as more monetary energy \u2014 it\u2019s like magnetism, you\u2019re de-magnetizing something, you\u2019re de-monetizing something! \u2014 as more monetary energy falls off of gold and off of silver and then off of indexes into Bitcoin, price discovery will return to these other assets! So price discovery\u2019s gonna return to gold and it\u2019s gonna return to its ornamental and antique value! And price discovery will return to silver, and price discovery will return to stocks and bonds. What you can assume is that in a free market, price discovery will return, the bond prices will fall, the yields will increase, real estate prices will fall, the yields will increase for commercial real estate, you will see stock prices fall, dividend yields and yields will increase \u2014 everything will rationalize in a free market. Market dynamics, conventional market theory dictates that: no asset can be any more attractive than any other asset in a free market, because capital will flow and migrate so as to equalize the expected return on all assets! Now what you\u2019re gonna see is certain markets become not free! The way you break that is you pass laws! The extreme cases will what you\u2019re seeing going on in India right now. What you saw in China makes it impossible to convert your RMB into Bitcoin. And India\u2019s threatened by it, Nigeria\u2019s threatened by it. You\u2019re gonna see back and forth, and you\u2019ll see some countries will embrace it and other countries will run from it! But you know, the Chinese made Google, Twitter\u2019s illegal, Facebook\u2019s illegal, right? That\u2019s gonna happen! And it didn\u2019t stop them from being successful other places! I think you\u2019ll probably see the Western world will embrace digital gold, I think you\u2019ll see banana republics, corrupt regimes, attempt to resist it! On the other hand, I\u2019ve traveled all through China and everybody\u2019s got a VPN and they\u2019re looking at Twitter and Facebook accounts with VPNs! It\u2019s really difficult \u2014 can they actually stop it? Not really, right? I mean they can\u2019t stop it, they actually have a hard time stopping money traveling on crypto rails over VPNs and the TOR network. On the other hand, will they suffer from it? Yeah! There\u2019s a big cost to not have Google! I mean there\u2019s a big cost to not have YouTube, right? There\u2019s a big cost to not have electricity! There\u2019s costs to reject technology! If your money moves a million times faster, then that means the cost of capital for the world that embraces the technology drops, and that means that innovation accelerates! And you can cling to your gold coins and your giant stone coins of the Yap people and whatever, but at some point \u2014 there\u2019s a cost not having Google Maps, man! Cars that don\u2019t drive themselves, you know? There\u2019s a cost! And eventually it reflects itself in the Cuba standard of living, or the North Korean standard of living, and even the Chinese can\u2019t necessarily stop this thing! So bottom line is: I think the fiat system is going to continue as a currency, and it should! The currency rails work fine! What people still haven\u2019t got through their head is, I could have 150% of my assets in Bitcoin! You can have a million dollars, you can buy $1 Million in Bitcoin, you can mortgage your house, buy another $500,000 in Bitcoin, you could take out a personal loan against your future earnings if you\u2019re a doctor \u2014 buy another $500k in Bitcoin! If it was me, I\u2019d mortgage my house, I\u2019d sell my gold, and I would raise debt and I would buy Bitcoin! You can have 100% of your assets in Bitcoin, get a bank that will give you a loan against Bitcoin, if Bitcoin is going up at 25% a year, and if your expenses are going up at 5% a year, you can borrow money to pay for your coffee and to pay your rent and to drive your car and to live your life forever!\u2014 never pay it back \u2014 keep the Bitcoin, and your debt-to-equity ratio will fall! And so at some point you could literally fund everything in Bitcoin, and so you don\u2019t need to replace the dollar is my point! You don\u2019t really want to spend Bitcoin! What you want to do, is you want to plug your Bitcoin account into a Visa card, and you want to pay for things with Visa, and you want to run up a debt, and you never want to pay it off, and you want to die owing money! It\u2019s not that complicated! You have a million dollars and it doubles every year \u2014 you eventually have $100 Million, you can spend $100,000 a year going up at 20% a year, or you can spend $100,000 going up at 50% a year, and you will die with $90 Million of equity, $10 Million in debt, never having paid tax! And you don\u2019t need to replace the Euro, you don\u2019t need to replace the dollar, you don\u2019t need to get rid of your Visa card, right? Those things don\u2019t matter!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:28:23]: Yeah I think another argument in favor of this is the fact that maybe Bitcoin is actually reducing the demand for the creation of dollars and Euros because if people don\u2019t buy as many treasuries as they do, then fewer dollars are created. People don\u2019t get into as much debt, and fewer dollars are created. And so if people are holding Bitcoin instead of holding debt instruments on their balance sheet then less debt takes places, and the key concept in The Fiat Standard is that fiat is debt. So basically Bitcoin reduces the demand and the supply for fiat! But I guess it\u2019s unfortunately it\u2019s not a choice we get to make, it\u2019s an outcome of markets. So the question is: Can the dollar hold on? And can printing the dollar manage to maintain the Bitcoin storm? I guess that\u2019s what we\u2019ll see! But there are reasons why we can see Bitcoin continue to grow without the dollar having to collapse. I\u2019ve got another question for you, switching gears a little bit: you waltzed into the Bitcoin world at a very very good time, you know! You came in at what was it $7, $8, $9,000, and within a couple of weeks we are now almost at $50,000 \u2014 it\u2019s at $47,000 I think right now. Obviously part of that is probably you and the impact that you have had \u2014 all the evangelism that you\u2019ve done! But also, we\u2019ve had periods in Bitcoin before where prices have declined for quite a while, so if this was high school, you would be signing up for high school the week of the prom and the graduation! You didn\u2019t sit with us through the dark days of holding the \u2014 buying the $1,000 top and watching it go down to $150 over two years! So I\u2019m wondering: you went in at a time where this was a possibility! We could have had another two years, you know? You may have chanced upon Bitcoin in 2018 and Bitcoin hasn\u2019t changed much between 2018 and 2020, but if you bought in March 2018 you would\u2019ve witnessed the decline for quite a while! So I\u2019m wondering, was your entry, were you just thinking, Alright, this is now better technology \u2014 I\u2019m just gonna be buying as much as I can! Or was there some kind of price analysis going on in a sense of, We\u2019ve consolidated for a while, so most likely we\u2019re gonna be getting another jump! Would you have bought as aggressively in 2018? And do you follow any particular models for thinking about the price?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: When I look back at my life, I can count all sorts of fortunate occurrences \u2014 so I\u2019m lucky! Second, I think the best time in human history to buy Bitcoin was starting in March of 2020! If you want to look at this entire thing\u2014starting from March of 2020 the world changed forever! That was the risk/reward point where the risk had diminished by 99%, and the return and the use case had amped by a factor of 100! It was an inflection point in March of 2020! Look, I wouldn\u2019t have bought it at all in February of 2020! I didn\u2019t know it existed \u2014 I didn\u2019t really care to think about it! The world was totally different in February versus in April, so I think March is the beginning of the new era. I think that people in the Bitcoin industry, I think to a certain degree, they\u2019re biased by their history, and it\u2019s a liability for them. I think it\u2019s baggage that they should lose! I think that most people in the Bitcoin industry \u2014 most people in business, most people in life, they want to draw on their experience, because there\u2019s a bias that, I want to make decisions based on my experience, and I want to feel that everything that I experienced was worthwhile! And if I felt pain, I would like for it to have meant something, right? So what if I looked at you and I said, Saif, nothing that you experienced between 2010\u20132020 was relevant! And you could basically flush it all down the toilet and take a clean sheet of paper and start again! That doesn\u2019t feel good! Right? Psychologically it\u2019s hard to let go of that, but let me give you an example of inflection point: for 10 years before March [2020], we had tried to use video conferencing and I used Webex. And my experiences were uniformly awful for the entire 10 years! I could probably write a book on all of the bad meetings and all of the awful dysfunctional business results that came from that, and I fired people that wanted to use video conferencing and wanted to work remotely the previous year! Okay? And I had lots of experience! And then in March we decided to use Zoom and Zoom was 100x better, and I had only good experiences! And the truth of the matter is, the entire decade of experience that I had with video conferencing was of no value whatsoever! It actually just saddled me with a prejudicial bias because I had scars and I had pain, and it\u2019s all irrelevant! So after March, everybody on Earth needed Bitcoin! 1,000 companies! You heard Ross last week, he said, I had 20 clients at the beginning of the year, I had 280 institutional clients at the end of the year, I have 90 in the pipeline now. Ross will have 1,000 clients! He\u2019ll go from 20 to 1,000! All of his experience before March, all of your forecasts before March \u2014 irrelevant! It\u2019s what I said to Keith McCullough, All your models \u2014 destroyed! Why are they destroyed? Because they\u2019re based upon the statistical interaction. A tidal wave hits the beach! Okay? I drop a bomb on your head! Your entire history living in the town or playing on the beach \u2014 irrelevant! Irrelevant! You want it to matter \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter! When $100 Trillion of capital comes through a nozzle \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter! If you took every trade of Bitcoin from the point that Satoshi did the whatever and the pizza transfer took place, all the way through the blow-off top, all of it is irrelevant! Let me explain it a different way: if Elon Musk woke up tomorrow and decided, Screw it! I\u2019m buying $10 Billion of Bitcoin instead of $1.5 Billion of Bitcoin! That one decision renders irrelevant all of the studying of Bitcoin\u2019s trajectory between today and last March! One person, one thing, makes a difference! And likewise, March rendered irrelevant the statistical models in the history before! What\u2019s going on right now is, on February 8th, on Monday, the day that you woke up, if you read the news, the world changed again! You have to keep redoing your models! The human race, I mean \u2014 read Paleo-theory: we ran around getting chased by wolves and apes for 3\u20134 Million years, starving to death! Life was difficult! And 10,000 years ago we invented agriculture \u2014 life changed again! 100 years ago \u2014 life changed again! The life of a human being today: the challenges, the dynamics \u2014 how many children get up and worry about getting eaten by a wild animal today? It\u2019s irrelevant, right? The history of the human race is irrelevant to a decision \u2014 like, you\u2019re gonna get in a car and drive the car? You can kill yourself in 3 seconds! What matters is, you\u2019re in the frickin\u2019 car! When you engineer a new system, it completely renders irrelevant your history! If I take a gun and I point it at your head\u2014and there\u2019s a bullet in it \u2014 nothing in the world that you\u2019ve lived through matters other than: can you get me to not pull the trigger? Everything else is irrelevant! And so, engineering machines, and when your circumstances change \u2014 when you\u2019re skiing down a ski-slope and there\u2019s an avalanche, all your skill as a skier \u2014 rendered irrelevant! All your skill as a human being! It\u2019s back to this issue of the guy that was the chairman of HNA \u2014 he was the richest guy in China, worth $30 Billion! 2 years ago? He went hiking in the South of France, stood on a rock wall, had a selfie taken, tripped and fell to his death! All of his money, all of his models, all of his lawyers, 87 Million frickin\u2019 people in China \u2014 irrelevant! In 1 second, he broke the law of gravity and he died! The point here is: Bitcoin has moved into a different zone, a phase shift! It was in one phase from 2010\u20132015, it went through another phase 2015\u20132018. When Bitcoin pulled ahead after the fork wars it moved into a different phase. And then in 2020 it moved into a different phase. And at the point that publicly traded companies started buying it and institutions started buying it and mainstream media started coping with it, when a Senator got elected, the mayor of Miami Beach, Senator Cynthia Lummis \u2014 when these things happen, when Gary Gensler takes his role at the SEC \u2014 you\u2019re in a different phase! And so, you have to recalibrate all of your models based upon a whole new set of assumptions. And it\u2019s like I took the spear out of your hand, I gave you a bow and arrow! The human race changed! I take your bow and arrow out of your hand, I gave you a gun! I take the gun out of your hand and I give you a bomb! As I change the engineering, the outlook changes and you cannot draw on your history anymore! You have to think differently!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:39:18]: Well I mean, I obviously agree with a lot of that, but let me push back a little bit in the sense that Bitcoin has not changed! It\u2019s been doing 1 block every 10 minutes for the past 12 years throughout all of these phases! And Bitcoin\u2019s volatility and market dynamics have not changed much! We\u2019ve gotten these big bull runs after the halvings every single time. So far, it\u2019s extraordinary what has happened in Bitcoin over the last year, but it isn\u2019t extraordinary by the standards of Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s happened before! So the question is: will this time be different, do you think? Have we moved into something fundamentally different after 2020 or would we still see a market cycle similar to what we had before?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:41:17]: Tell me how \u2014 this is a good question for anybody on the call! How do you think that\u2019s ever gonna be sold?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Yeah I can\u2019t see it getting sold! I see them just accumulating more!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: It\u2019s actually more extreme than that! It isn\u2019t possible to sell it, Saifedean! There is no mechanism to sell it! The construction of the trust is such that, when the money flows into the trust, they buy Bitcoin, there are GBTC shares that are issued. Those shares can be sold and the price of the shares \u2014 the derivatives can go down \u2014 the underlying Bitcoin can never be sold per the charter! Ever! Ever! So you see, there are fundamental different things that are going on! Last I checked they had $30 Billion of Bitcoin. That\u2019s $30 Billion of Bitcoin that can\u2019t be sold! Okay? Held by institutions! A very different world! So these are sources of inertia falling into Bitcoin. And the volatility is not the same! If you look at the drawdowns, they\u2019re not the same. Like when Bitcoin ran up to $40,000 it traded by down to $30,000 \u2014 that was a 25% retracement. Not an 80% retracement!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:42:35]: So you think the days of 80% retracements are over?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Yes! I do! Let me say it a different way: if you\u2019re a Boy Scout and you\u2019re shivering in the freezing cold and you\u2019re attempting to start a fire for the first time, you recall how difficult it is to start a fire and then you recall going to sleep without a fire and then maybe your friend froze to death and you\u2019re mortified by it! But then one day you grow up and you have a furnace in your house, or maybe you plug into someone else\u2019s electrical system and you have an electrical heater \u2014 you\u2019re not a Boy Scout anymore! Right? It\u2019s a totally different world, and the system, the network, is much more mature, it\u2019s just much better engineered, there\u2019s much more monetary energy in it, there\u2019s much more inertia. I mean ultimately, there\u2019s massive amounts of monetary inertia in the system! It\u2019s like an air compressor. We\u2019re compressing energy in a monetary battery and it\u2019s accelerating if you look at the rate at which energy is flowing into it! And as that energy flows, it\u2019s stabilizing! So the more monetary energy flowing in the system, the more stable it is, the more inertia it is, the more difficult it is to change the direction, and the less volatility it has! And I think that you\u2019re gonna continue to see that as these banks evolve! It\u2019s very clear to me ever since March, you can literally see the volatility and the instability in the entire network being damped by rational actors!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:44:13]: Let me give you my counter-case: I think ultimately, the more money comes into Bitcoin, the more the price goes up, the problem there is that you start getting more and more Bitcoin minted, so effectively Bitcoin becomes more inflationary as the price rises and I think this might be why the halving dynamic always will have a big rise but also a crash, because over the past 4 years in the previous halving period we had 4 years in which we were making 1,800 Bitcoins a day worth on average 7, 8, $9,000, so you had about $14 Million a day of new Bitcoins being produced! So for the price to hold around that level, we had to have $14 Million of new demand a day. Now, there\u2019s only so much more the demand can increase! There will come a point in which the demand goes up, and so the price goes up, and then the price of the new coins that\u2019ll be mined is also going up massively, so then the new supply becomes bigger than the demand \u2014 the demand can\u2019t keep up with the supply, and you witness an inflection because there\u2019s also a lot of leverage! A lot of people that are leveraged in so they get wiped out and then the technicals of the chart turn, and then we can have another big drawdown! What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:45:30]: I\u2019m not really a big believer in the halvings as being a driver going forward! Again I think that all of these models are mental models that were formed in the early years, and I think that you should throw them all out! And you should start to reason from first principles and build a new model! For example: I\u2019m staring at the screen of Binance right now! The 24-hour volume of BTC is 93,000 coins on Binance. If you double it, that means there\u2019s probably 180,000 coins traded today! 900 Bitcoin is irrelevant! The amount of Bitcoin being created is so de minimis compared to the volume of the trading, it\u2019s irrelevant! And also, I think it\u2019s irrelevant to any rational investor! It\u2019s just irrelevant to me! For example: there\u2019s 21 Million fully-diluted Bitcoins! Done! End of Story! Like, I don\u2019t care at what point they get printed because \u2014 again, what\u2019s the ratio of 93,000 to 900? The amount of Bitcoin getting mined is 50 basis points! It\u2019s half of a percent! Like when we\u2019re doing a trade, we pay half a percent as the fee! Like, people with serious amounts of money \u2014 they\u2019re gonna blow through this! They don\u2019t care! What matters a lot more than all of these concerns about the halving is if Paul Tudor Jones wakes up and decides to double his allocation from 1% to 2%? Or from 2% to 4%? That matters more than all of these other things, because the demand is excessive! So I think a better way to look at it is, it\u2019s emerging as an asset class like the S&P 500 index. And when it gets to be $10 Trillion or $5 Trillion or $3 Trillion just like the index, there\u2019s so much money coming in and going out of it that it\u2019s stabilizing the index, and it takes \u2014 if you\u2019ve got a $10 Trillion asset class like gold, it would take a Trillion dollars! Why do you think I didn\u2019t buy gold? It\u2019s because I said, Well it\u2019s gonna take $20 Trillion to drive gold up by a factor of 10! How much does it really take, right? If you have a Trillion dollar asset class, then a Trillion dollars will probably drive it up by a factor of 10. Like if you double the demand? Maybe more! But if you\u2019ve got a $10 Trillion asset class, a Trillion dollars drives it up by a factor of 2, maybe, or 50%. So as it gets more monetary energy, the inertial component gets greater, the liquidity gets greater! I really think for institutional investors, the halving just doesn\u2019t matter anymore! The dynamic that matters is \u2014 another example: if Dan Schulman wakes up tomorrow and says, I think I should put Bitcoin on PayPal\u2019s balance sheet! Dan Schulman has a $300 Billion company! He could put $10 Billion of Bitcoin on the balance sheet! When Coinbase becomes public, they might be worth $100 Billion! If the CEO of Coinbase decides to put Bitcoin on the balance sheet, he could put a Billion on the balance sheet! $2\u20133 Billion! The decisions of individuals! Ray Dalio is giving a speech at ConsenSys. Ray Dalio\u2019s got $150 Billion of assets under management. If he decides that Bitcoin is 25% as good as gold, won\u2019t they buy like $10 Billion of it? Ray Dalio, Brian Armstrong, Dan Shulman, right? Individuals! There\u2019s probably 10,000 people in the world that have the ability to put a Billion dollars on the network! 10,000! And there\u2019s 1,000\u20132,000 that have the ability to put $10 Billion on the network! Again, every model that you have and all the history that we have is all irrelevant if any of them act! The actors, the actions that get taken place obsolesce and they overwhelm any statistical models, because the statistical models are based upon \u2014 like if you told me \u2014 for example, in 2018 you have a bunch of Bitcoin and crypto traders that are trading with leverage that have no banks, they can\u2019t borrow money against their Bitcoin, okay? Those people have a very short time preference, Saifedean! You\u2019re the time guy, right? The people that have the shortest time preference I\u2019ve found are crypto traders! I mean, they\u2019re thinking about whether or not it\u2019s trading down in the next 8 hours, right? So when I ask people, Why don\u2019t you put 100% of your assets into Bitcoin they say, Well I need money to live on! Well why don\u2019t you just borrow money? Who\u2019s gonna loan me money? BlockFi! Oh BlockFi, they charge 12%, 10%, right? So there\u2019s a very embryonic industry right now\u2014the consumer banking industry that\u2019s banking Bitcoin. By the way: name 5 companies that\u2019ll give you $100 Million loan against Bitcoin? Name 5. Can you? No! No! It\u2019s embryonic! I can name 5 that\u2019ll give me a $100 Million loan against Apple stock! Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley \u2014 everybody! Okay? And here\u2019s my point: Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need to change! What\u2019s changing is the banks! The banks are changing! NYDIG will give you a loan! Genesis will give you a loan! When Coinbase will give you a loan \u2014 Binance is rolling out some credit products. PayPal won\u2019t give you a loan yet, but what happens when PayPal gives 340 Million people a loan at 4% interest against Bitcoin? What happens to Bitcoin? Well, time horizons stretch out! Now I can own it for 30 years. Oh you mean I don\u2019t have to sell my Bitcoin to buy my Lamborghini? If you actually believe Bitcoin\u2019s going up by a factor of 2 every 2 years you\u2019re an idiot to sell your Bitcoin to buy your Lamborghini! The Lamborghini\u2019s gonna cost you $100 Million! Why don\u2019t you borrow the money to buy the Lamborghini and keep the Bitcoin? Well I\u2019m afraid! I\u2019m afraid of what? I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s gonna crash down by 80%. Why? Well because it did once before! Okay? So you see this circular reasoning which is: I lived in a world of crypto traders on leverage with no banking with no institutional support, and so I act. It\u2019s just like your time preference: I\u2019m afraid to plan for the future because I don\u2019t trust the money! A lot of people in their head, they think Bitcoin is volatile, I don\u2019t trust it, I won\u2019t be able to borrow against it! And that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy! There\u2019s only a certain amount of \u2014 rate\u2014at which you can change people\u2019s perceptions, right? It takes 3, 4, 5, 6 years! As the HODLers discover that they can borrow money against Bitcoin, and as the institutions come in \u2014 by the way, what\u2019s Warren Buffett\u2019s famous quote? We find a company we like, our preferred holding period is forever! Is Warren Buffett still owning Coca-Cola stock? Yes! Did he sell it to buy a Lamborghini? No! Did he need to? No! Why? Because he could\u2019ve borrowed against it! Yeah! What\u2019s the impact on Coke stock? It\u2019s not so volatile! Right? Because he\u2019s a HODLer! So this is not an uncommon idea! So institutions that hold gold, how long have they been holding gold? Like, forever! What happens if you replace gold with digital gold? You hold it for 50 years! By the way, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be able to buy Bitcoin! Bitcoin below $20,000 \u2014 gone forever! Bitcoin below $30,000 \u2014 probably gone forever! Bitcoin below $40,000 \u2014 probably gone forever! Bitcoin in the $40,000\u201350,000 range? Who do you think is selling this stuff? The weak hands, with high leverage, are selling. Who do you think is buying it? Institutions! That have more money than God! That have 1,000x as much money as they\u2019re buying with this stuff. And which ones? The first 1%, just the early vanguard. So as this happens, the institutions take ownership, their time horizon is a decade. The banks come online, that means we never need to sell it ever! I mean all these guys on crypto Twitter go, Well what are you gonna do if you ever need money? And the answer is: I\u2019m never gonna need money! Right? Institutions never need money! If I ever wanted a little bit of cash, I could just borrow a little bit, but the truth of the matter is, the people buying this stuff are endowments! Harvard endowment, Yale endowment, right? So it\u2019s a different set of holders, it\u2019s a different banking relationship, it\u2019s gonna be more diffuse. As it\u2019s more diffuse, the volatility falls! You\u2019re gonna have the stories of Ruffer, Saifedean! Ruffer bought $750 Million of Bitcoin below $20,000 when it traded at $40,000 they took half off the table, so they took a $750 Million profit. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t trade up beyond $40,000! So then it traded down to $31,000. They might have bought back in, Saif! Those guys, the big institutions, they\u2019re going to be damping it on the upside, on the downside, and collaring it. And this will continue for a while! So it\u2019s a different dynamic because of the players and the capital and the banks and the security, and it\u2019s going to continue to evolve and the risk profile and the perceptions will evolve!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:55:36]: Yeah and I think also the best argument against this is just, yeah maybe the mining becomes just completely inconsequential compared to the daily volume and then in that case it doesn\u2019t even matter if it\u2019s \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Look, I would say that it\u2019s already inconsequential! I think the only people clinging to that are people that like to talk about miners! I mean, I don\u2019t think the miners can move the market one way or the other! Let me make one more point: as the miners become public, they have publicly traded stocks! It\u2019s irrational for them to ever sell Bitcoin! What did Marathon just do \u2014 they bought Bitcoin! If you can raise equity or raise debt in the public market, the miners might stop selling it! Because isn\u2019t it the stupidest thing you could possibly \u2014 who goes into the mining business thinking Bitcoin\u2019s going down in price? Right? Nobody! So why would you sell something going up in price by 100\u2013200% a year? You wouldn\u2019t! What happens, Saifedean, if all the miners become public, and they stop selling?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:56:46]: Yeah it\u2019s like new, extra demand. It\u2019s supercharged demand because it buys at the source."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Let me reverse it a different way: what happens if the miners stop selling and start buying? Marathon raised $200 Million in equity and bought $150 Million of Bitcoin! Okay? So my point here really is: there\u2019s other dynamics! It\u2019s possible that you could have 10 miners become public, they all raise $25 Billion \u2014 they just all buy! And then they mine Bitcoin to keep! And now what happens if I reverse the polarity in the entire situation? The halving doesn\u2019t matter! Right? There\u2019s other things that matter! At the end of the day, 1,000 Bitcoin at $40,000 \u2014 what\u2019s that net you? $40 Million a day or something? $40 Million of capital a day is irrelevant compared to $10 Billion of purchasing a day!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [1:57:40]: But it wouldn\u2019t be irrelevant at $400,000 a Bitcoin! A $400,000 Bitcoin that\u2019s $400 Million of new Bitcoin!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: It\u2019ll still be irrelevant! Because the trading of the rest of the marketplace is gonna be 100x more than that!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Well currently I think that \u2014 Daniel just posted a screenshot saying that current daily trading volume is about $15 Billion, so currently it\u2019s at 3%. So if price goes up 10-fold, then mining is 30% of the market if trading stays constant at around $15 Billion. So 3% now, but if the price goes up 10-fold, if it\u2019s at $480,000, then you\u2019re doing about half a Billion of new Bitcoin being minted every day! Which is a lot of [inaudible 1:58:26]"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [2:00:07]: So it\u2019s not that big a deal now, but the point really is: there are other dynamics here and they could flip the polarity! What happens if $10 Billion comes from the public markets into the Bitcoin market because these miners \u2014 I think Marathon\u2019s got a $3 Billion market cap, Riot\u2019s got a $3 Billion market cap \u2014 what happens if they double and they issue debt or issue equity? My point is: all your models are destroyed! Humility here is \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of people here that can tip the apple cart here! So if you construct this model based upon the past, you\u2019re dismissing the actions of rational actors! It\u2019s rational for a miner to buy Bitcoin, not sell Bitcoin! It\u2019s rational for a miner to go public! It\u2019s rational for Square or PayPal to buy more Bitcoin! They might not, by the way! It\u2019s irrational not to! They might not because of volatility. How do you convince your customers to buy Bitcoin with your app when you\u2019re afraid to buy it on your balance sheet, right? Isn\u2019t there a little bit of a marketing hazard there? So there\u2019s rational actors with capital that can move this Bitcoin and they can change the volatility and they can drive it very very hard. And the only thing that keeps them from doing it is getting up in the morning and deciding they\u2019ll take a risk! If you basically bet that nobody will act rationally and nobody will take a risk, then you can run your historical models! But if I can break your model \u2014 if I break your model with action \u2014 then you probably ought to have a more open-ended view of the world, a different model! I look at it and I say, Everybody on Earth with money should buy this stuff and all 7.8 Billion people need it and it\u2019s only distributed to 0.1% of the market \u2014 what\u2019s wrong with this picture? At some point, someone is gonna decide to do the rational thing! Arguably they\u2019re doing it now! If price is going up 300% a year, that seems to me to be rational risk-takers acting about as fast as they can reasonably act! Without, you know, going through the sound barrier! Going through the sound barrier \u2014 there\u2019s a shock wave, and you rip the wings off the airplane! We\u2019re kind of pushing up against the sound barrier \u2014 the rate at which \u2014 what\u2019s the fastest an asset class can take on monetary energy without burning itself up! This might be close to the fastest! Because it\u2019s accelerating, isn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t seen the numbers \u2014 someone should calculate the annualized yield, but I thought it was 230% RoR something, over the last 5\u201310 years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [2:03:22]: The average growth rate per year was about 200% for the first 10 years."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: And it\u2019s accelerated this year!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Well, yeah. But it always goes through those cycles so far with fast and then slow, with variability. So yeah we were due for a very fast year this year anyway. Now look, as an Austrian economist I\u2019m always exactly on the same page with you on that fact that it is the actions of humans that determines economic outcomes and not statistical models and constructs! But, this year we\u2019ve been fascinated a little bit with the Stock to Flow model and it drives me to think that there might be something mechanical about the way that the difficulty adjustment and the mining determine how the price moves, just because there\u2019s a limit over how much the price can go up over time!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [2:03:45]: I don\u2019t think the Stock to Flow model really can explain what\u2019s going on here, because as I said, I immediately assumed it was 21 Million diluted Bitcoin and that\u2019s what I made my decision based on, and I assumed that stock to flow is infinite, and I think that a stock to flow doesn\u2019t take into account the actions of the fiat central banks to inflate the currency and clearly if there was zero inflation versus 400% inflation that\u2019s a factor! You know, Zimbabwe inflation rates are different than the US and the US is radically different than a year ago! So I think you gotta take into account monetary policy and I think you gotta take into account technology! Stock to flow doesn\u2019t take into account what happens if Tim Cook decides to build Bitcoin into the Apple Watch and into the Apple Phone? Those actions in technology, they have an impact, and doing it sooner rather than later will do it! And I know for a fact there are 10 people in the world \u2014 all they would have to do is put out a press release and they would move the price of Bitcoin! And so the technology adoption and the monetary policy \u2014 all those things, they have a massive impact on what happens, yet they\u2019re not really part of the stock to flow!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [2:04:58]: No the aren\u2019t! But I mean\u2014and rationally, this is why you would expect the model to break down, and yet it doesn\u2019t! And that is really the mind-blowing thing as far as I\u2019m concerned! And I think \u2014 it might sound funny to say it \u2014 but the model would\u2019ve expected a big squeeze after the halving! And so you know, that\u2019s needed \u2014 people like you and MassMutual to show up and carry the banner after we\u2019ve done the light lifting \u2014 you guys do the heavy lifting taking us to $100k! And I think, yeah! 2025 is when you would expect people like Apple to be building their entire company around something like Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s a little maybe too early for them to start now but I think maybe by 2025 they\u2019ll be sold and they\u2019ll be convinced and that\u2019s what\u2019s going to take us further! So the trend undeniably is Number Go Up! But what the model shows is that that number going up happens in spurts after the halving and then there\u2019s a bit of a come down and consolidation after it, that it follows this market pattern. So it seems to be holding up now, and that for me \u2014 and it\u2019s really sacrilegious as an Austrian economist to be saying this \u2014 but it suggests that maybe there is something about the way that the network works that is forcing this! And in fact, if you read Mises, what Mises says is, The reason you can\u2019t perform economic calculation and make scientific predictions in economics, is that economics does not have a constant. There is no constant in economics. In physics, in chemistry, in math, in all those things\u2014well not in math \u2014 you go back to a physical constant that is personally determined and easy to assert them and all of them go back to constants of nature, eventually. So based on that you\u2019re able to make scientific relationships and devise them. And it seems to me that \u2014 maybe\u2014the stock to flow model is showing us the ability to form calculations with human action for the first time with this kind of accuracy, maybe 21 Million is economics\u2019 first constant!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [2:07:05]: Well I agree with you, 21 Million is an important constant!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Kelly is asking: What do you think in terms of second and third order effects that you look forward to under our new March \u201920 paradigm?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Well I think one effect is: the first 10 years, stock to flow and Bitcoin miners selling Bitcoin bootstrapped the network. I think we\u2019ll see an inversion, it\u2019s possible that all the Bitcoin miners become public and they stop selling any Bitcoin, and they become banks of their own, they start issuing equity and debt to finance the market, and you could actually see a reverse polarity there! As Bitcoin crashes into institutions that are publicly financeable, I think the dynamic changes quite a lot, because they have different options to access liquidity! So it\u2019s a different network when it\u2019s individuals that are unbanked that are in the cash business, than it is when it\u2019s institutions that are very very well-banked and well-financed! I think the network moving toward the point where it\u2019s just all transaction-based, and I think the transaction block size \u2014 those will get larger and transaction fees will go up and the network will settle into some equilibrium there as well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: How did you come to your conclusion about Bitcoin\u2019s total addressable market?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [2:08:27]: I just take all the money in the world and I figure about half of it needs to be allocated to actual collectibles\u2014trophies! If you look at the typical person, everybody owns a set of things: their house, their car, their boat, their trophy assets that they\u2019re gonna keep, and those will have monetary value imbued in them. Those are the goods and products and whatever. And then there\u2019s another chunk which is just the treasury \u2014 everybody\u2019s got a natural treasury. And that\u2019s capital saved up for the future against uncertainty! I think it\u2019s natural that Bitcoin will just continually absorb that treasury energy from endowments, from corporations, from individuals, and my estimate is that it feels like it\u2019s about half! Half of everything should be treasury and the other half is tangible property! You can estimate it by counting the volume of gold and the total amount in sovereign debt: half of sovereign debt\u2014maybe you want to give a loan to your government because you love the government, but my experience is that 90% of the money invested in sovereign debt wasn\u2019t because we loved the government, it was just a store of value! And if you look at the S&P I think people invested in the S&P because they just didn\u2019t have confidence in their ability to pick stocks \u2014 they wanted a store of value! So I think if you added up all the store of value asset classes, you\u2019ll probably find yourself getting to a $200 Trillion number, plus or minus, against $400\u2013500 Trillion \u2014 it depends on how you calculate it! So you kind of conclude it\u2019s like 40\u201350%. And it\u2019s kind of common sense, right? Half of your money is, you want to save as fungible asset, and the other half you invest in things you love or things you believe in or you take risks on companies or the like. I think that was pretty obvious back in the day when savings accounts existed, it\u2019s just that savings accounts have been destroyed and so now people are saving in the stock market!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [2:10:26]: Yeah! Alright I guess the final question that I wanted to ask you is: when are we going to turn you into a carnivore? How have you not become a carnivore yet? Or are you carnivore?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I\u2019m a big Paleo-theorist! So long before I discovered Bitcoin I was a Paleo enthusiast and I think that a lot of stuff that comes out of thinking about how Paleolithic man lived for 3 Million years, I think is really useful health advice! What did your forebearers eat, and how did they live 100,000 years ago I think is helpful! It\u2019s helpful in your fitness routines and your eating routines. I think that 100,000\u2013200,000 years ago people ate lean proteins and they ate low-sugar content \u2014 maybe nuts. They didn\u2019t eat sugar-laden fruits and they probably didn\u2019t eat highly-engineered modern food, they certainly didn\u2019t eat any processed food. So my view is, I am pretty much carnivore! I eat a lot of steak, I eat a lot of chicken and fish, but I think that vegetables and nuts are okay! I think the keto diet is a pretty good diet. I understand the Salisbury Diet, I think that in the event that you have auto-immune diseases or inflammation or rheumatoid arthritis I\u2019ve seen that it\u2019s very effective, and so I can imagine living off of all meat, but I think it\u2019s equally reasonable \u2014 if you\u2019re coming up with a theory of health, I think if you start with the question: how did human beings live for 3 Million years before the modern agricultural age? And you model your lifestyle based upon that, I think that\u2019s consistent with the healthiest lifestyle, and your conclusions are: you\u2019re probably not gonna drink orange juice, you\u2019re not gonna drink cartons of vodka, you\u2019re not gonna consume processed foods, you\u2019re not gonna sit in a chair all day long, you\u2019re not gonna be afraid to be out in the sun all day long, you should probably do vigorous activity, and you should probably eat lean, healthy proteins!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Yeah! Well I\u2019ll just tell you the case for carnivore is ultimately that if you try it, you\u2019ll see that the difference going from standard American diet to keto is almost comparable to the difference of going from keto to pure carnivore. Just getting rid of all plant matter and your body is made out of red meat and if you just eat red meat your digestive system will just have an enormously easy time with it! So I saw you drinking some cola there! I think if you ate a lot more beef, you would need fewer snacks and fewer pick-me-ups and fewer caffeine things!

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [06:56]: I remember the name of the Jewish bankers: it\u2019s the Warburgs! If you want a great vignette on why it\u2019s important to have capital that\u2019s mobile, study or just read any history of the Warburgs and what their family went through, and what all the Jewish families went through in the 30\u2019s in Germany. And what the bankers had to do to move capital out of the country, and you get a very poignant punctuated appreciation for the need of having secure capital that you control! So there\u2019s some, I think, general themes of technology throughout history, if you look across all of these. The general theme is: human beings marching toward being harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! And everyone that\u2019s succeeded \u2014 every empire, individual, company \u2014 they all found a way to be harder, smarter, faster, stronger. George R.R. Martin, he wrote a bunch of books \u2014 he\u2019s known for Game of Thrones, but he also wrote a bunch of books on superheroes, or at least he called them wildcards. And it\u2019s about a bunch of superheroes or super-people that have genetic mutations, and they get it from some virus, and it\u2019s a universe full of normal people, and then jokers \u2014 people who have been hideously deformed by this virus, and then aces \u2014 people that have been given superpower. And he takes a very modern view of it, and he starts to analyze superpowers: a guy figures out he can shoot laser beams out of his hands, another woman can be invisible, or some dude can be a thin man! And he goes, There a lot of these superheroes, but after a while we quickly realized that the most powerful ones were the ones with defensive superpowers. Defensive attributes overcome all of the offensive attributes in a battle! So for example, the guy that\u2019s indestructible with no other superpower, can pick up a machine gun and kill everybody! And you can shoot him a million times, but he\u2019s indestructible! Whereas, the guy with the laser beams jumping out of his hands, he\u2019s just as mortal as you and me! And you hit him with one rock\u2014he goes down and he\u2019s dead! So it\u2019s the impossible-to-kill ones that end up winning all the battles between superheroes in the smackdown, and the ones with the sexy things, or sexy, really cool superpowers \u2014 they\u2019re useless! Because the guy that\u2019s got none of those \u2014 he just gets a bazooka and he just fires! Or he\u2019s like, I\u2019m indestructible so I\u2019m gonna set off an atomic bomb in the city and kill everybody but myself because I\u2019m indestructible! It\u2019s pretty easy to win the war if you\u2019re indestructible. And it causes you to come to a conclusion about history and who wins in history: unbreakable is better, antifragile is best! So the superhero that\u2019s good is the one that you hit him and you can\u2019t hurt him! But the superheroes that are most frightening are the ones where you shoot him with a laser beam and now they can shoot your laser beams back at you! And you mind-read them and they absorb your mind-reading and they can mind-read you! And you fly at the speed at the sound and now they can fly at the speed of sound! [11:05] Like that character, what is it \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: I think it\u2019s Rogue in X-Men?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [11:13]: Yeah, or Sylar in Heroes. Maybe Rogue! It\u2019s the one that absorbs your power and plays it back at you! You know, pretty soon it\u2019s like, I am indestructible and I have every other power and you just better get out of the way! And that\u2019s antifragile, right? I\u2019m looking for the fight! I\u2019m looking for people because I\u2019m just gonna absorb their thing! So you see that theme through history: the really successful governments, empires, organizations, they\u2019re continually fighting, they\u2019re continually absorbing \u2014 the Romans absorbed the Carthaginian\u2019s navy in 90 days! It\u2019s easier said than done! It wasn\u2019t like some Roman politician said, These are Carthaginian ships \u2014 they\u2019re inferior to us. We will invent our own ships! It\u2019s like, Not too proud to copy, not too proud to absorb it! This kind of principle can explain the success the United States in the wars of the last century or more. Why did we win World War I, World War II? Why is America America? Well there\u2019s two narratives. Millionaires. One is: because we\u2019re more patriotic and we\u2019re righteous and we\u2019re better! The other one is: the Europeans were fighting in Europe and we were fighting in Europe! So we were fighting, they were soft! When you\u2019re dropping bombs in the middle of suburban Germany, you\u2019re attacking the soft underbelly of the citizens in Germany, or the soft underbelly of the citizens in France, or the Battle of Britain. This is the citizen population being ravaged by a war. And that destroyed their economies, right? Destroyed their culture! Same happened in Russia, Italy. It\u2019s happened in China, and the Chinese fought a war in China\u2019s soil. The Japanese fought sort of a portion of a war on their own soil with the atomic warheads. On the other and, the US hadn\u2019t fought a war on US soil since 1865. Okay? So who\u2019s hard? Back to this missile idea, right? If you can throw a missile 3,000 miles and your enemy can throw a missile back 300 miles back at you \u2014 it\u2019s pretty simple: I have a rifle, you have a pistol! I stand back 1,000 feet \u2014 your pistol\u2019s good for 200 feet! I take 100 shots, eventually 1 hits \u2014 you\u2019re a perfect shot, it doesn\u2019t matter! Longer arms! So this idea: art you unbreakable? Or back to terrain: what is the terrain? The geography determines a lot of things! If you take a modern ship: take a modern yacht built in the year 2020, with every piece of modern equipment on it. Now try to sail it to Afghanistan! You probably won\u2019t get there! Something will probably break! Try to sail it to Rome without stopping in a port along the way. You probably won\u2019t make it! Robert, nobody does! They all stop and hide somewhere! It\u2019s really hard to move stuff over the ocean thousands of miles! It\u2019s really hard! Now, why don\u2019t you try to sail an armada of 1,000 ships 3,000 miles in order to invade America? Germans couldn\u2019t sail 13 miles across the Straits of Dover! The Japanese couldn\u2019t cross from Japan to China during the kamikaze, and that\u2019s not very far! It\u2019s really hard! There\u2019s only one guy that ever pulled it off\u2014William the Conqueror in 1066! Nobody else managed to cross 13 miles. That\u2019s your hydraulic moat! It\u2019s really hard! It explains the culture of the U.K. It explains the culture of the United States. It explains a lot of other culture. It explains the balance of power, I think! If you just say, Here\u2019s someone that you couldn\u2019t kill who could kill you! I had the option to fight on your turf, but you would never have the option to fight on my turf. Now, that in and of its way is the reason that security is so incredibly important to the Bitcoin network! What is important is that it not break! If I\u2019m indestructible, I don\u2019t have to be the fastest, the shiniest, the whatever anything! I just have to be indestructible! If I\u2019m indestructible \u2014 the indestructible man goes and buys a machine gun and he\u2019s the most powerful superhero in the room, right? The indestructible blockchain goes and buys a digital app, or another crypto network, an off-chain app, or a Lightning, or a Binance, or a Coinbase, or a Square Cash or whatever, and it\u2019s just fine! It\u2019s the most powerful network in the room! [17:29] Because the thing that made it the winner was its indestructibility, its immortality! Not the fact that it could shoot laser beams from its fingers, or it was beautiful, or it could fly with its pretty wings, or it was invisible. All of these other things? Privacy, transactions \u2014 all these other things, they\u2019re interesting, but they pale compared to the characteristic of immortality! Being indestructible in the here and now \u2014 pretty useful superhero power! Being indestructible and never aging \u2014 double useful superpower! And as for the rest, if you\u2019re an open software protocol, someone\u2019s gonna code an extension to your protocol to give you every other cool power that anybody wants! I can find a way to construct every other superpower by hook or crook, and that makes me antifragile and now I\u2019m like the frightening impossible-to-stop superhero!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [18:41]: That\u2019s a great analogy! Calls to mind that all saying that, If you wait long enough by the river, you can see the bodies of your enemy float by! It\u2019s like, Because Bitcoin is unchangeable and it\u2019s just a rock-solid, absolute scarce quantity of 21 Million, and that is the primary property in money that matters \u2014 I love the analogy that you gave too of, when someone asks you about the EPS of your company, they only care about the fully diluted cap table, right? Who gives a shit if you\u2019ve got 18 outstanding \u2014 whatever! Just tell me the fully diluted number! And that\u2019s what Bitcoin is, right? It\u2019s like, you know that it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s only\u20143 Million have been lost, or 18 Million and a half mined so far and 3 and a half to go \u2014 all that really matters is that fully diluted figure of 21 Million! And that the scarcity cannot be compromised, and then that it has enough antifragility on top of that to absorb other market-proven features \u2014 that\u2019s all you want in money!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [19:45]: Yeah! The mining rate, it\u2019s like a secondary particular effect that happens in the first few years of its evolution, but exponentially it becomes irrelevant. It\u2019s a second order driver. The first order driver is, [Is] the hardness infinitely hard? And then adoption and utility and inflation in the fiat reference frame that it\u2019s operating in. A couple more points that are worth making on technology and human history. Humans triumph throughout history by channeling energy. All of these things come down to: how did I channel energy? So, navy power. The British Navy ruled the sea, the Phoenicians, the Venetians, the Greeks, the Romans. The Americans today control the seas via their aircraft carriers and via naval power. And naval power is just bringing overwhelming stronger force to bear that\u2019s faster, that\u2019s harder, than any other force anywhere on Earth. I park an aircraft carrier somewhere and death rains from above! So we\u2019ve seen all empires are driven by a naval power. In time, we invented airplanes. And then air power became the thing! And air power is again all about death from above: the most powerful navy idea is airplanes flying off an aircraft carrier! First it was the battleship by: show up in your harbor \u2014 I blast everything. Then it became air power. And if I could get above you \u2014 and we saw this in [inaudible 21:56] \u2014 it is impossible for a modern nation state to function if it does not control its own air space. You saw that in the First Gulf War, the Second Gulf War. The United States, especially the United States air force, could pretty much bomb any country back to the Stone Age in a matter of a week, once you lose your air supremacy, once you lose control of your air space. There\u2019s no hope for you! You can take out every port, every power reactor, every generator, every serious building, they\u2019re all gone. Death from above! There\u2019s nothing you can do! You\u2019re at the bottom of the gravity well. And with technology today, someone can sit out 6 miles up \u2014 you can\u2019t shoot down a plane moving at high speeds 6 miles up! You have to fight the gravity well to get there! They\u2019re just working opposite: it\u2019s an energy thing, right? So I\u2019m moving from a lower energy state\u2014I\u2019m on the ground moving enemies around, to a higher energy state \u2014 I have a boat, I\u2019m moving heavy masses around, to a higher energy state \u2014 I\u2019m above you dropping munitions on you. Then after that, it became nuclear power! You harness nuclear power and that ended World War II pretty definitively in a hurry. Then we go to space satellite power! And then you go up the gravity well some more, and that manifests itself primarily with GPS. If you look at the impact of having a Global Positioning Satellite, that\u2019s what allows me to drop a laser-guided bomb or a drone anywhere on Earth and guide it day or night to anything! And that\u2019s a massive source of American supremacy \u2014 controlling those GPS satellites! And you lose them \u2014 big problem, too! [23:53] One of my favorite books, and I note it, is The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. And in it, Robert Heinlein, he writes about a bunch of Loonies\u2014basically Libertarians that live on the moon that believe in making their own way, and their motto is, There ain\u2019t no such thing as a free lunch! Abbreviated to TANSTAAFL, and he introduced that idea, and he introduced that idea. And they take it to the extreme, which is like, You\u2019re air\u2019s not even free on the moon\u2014you pay for everything! You pay for water, you pay for food, you pay for air. Everybody pulls their own weight. No one waits for a bail-out. There\u2019s no bail-out coming from anybody. And they\u2019re not big fans of authority. They don\u2019t like being told what to do! And the plot of the book winds on that they\u2019re being oppressed by Earthlings who are making them work as slaves and they\u2019re taking 90% of their economic productivity and shipping back basically their future to Earth and they\u2019re gradually suffocating and starving them to death. It\u2019s just onerous. Taxation without representation! But onerous. So the Loonies decide to fight back with the help of an A.I. computer. The first A.I. computer I can remember! The name of the computer is Mike, by the way! And their technique is they realize that they\u2019ve gotta catapult, and they start tossing rocks down the gravity well, and they just take a big rock, put it in their catapult, and it doesn\u2019t take that much force to toss it off the moon because they\u2019re low-G, they\u2019re tossing the rock out of a 1/8th G or whatever, and it hits the Earth, goes into a trajectory, and of course this starts picking up speed! And by the time it lands, it\u2019s like an atomic warhead. They just start tossing \u2019em at random places until the Federation Empire that\u2019s oppressing them decides that maybe it\u2019s had enough! And of course the lesson is: it\u2019s humans channeling energy, but they\u2019re channeling gravitational energy \u2014 and a lot of it! And there\u2019s a lot more energy than the stuff that we have! All through human history \u2014 since a million years ago to today \u2014 it\u2019s really the story of intelligent people looking around for, Where is the energy coming from? And how do I channel it in a network in order to achieve something harder, smarter, faster, stronger?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [26:44]: That\u2019s such an interesting point! Back to the terrain of the battle \u2014 they\u2019re holding the ultimate high ground being on the moon! Another thing this calls to mind is, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve read the book Sovereign Individual?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve read it all \u2014 I\u2018ve heard of it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Yeah written in the late 90\u2019s, and it\u2019s been relatively prescient in a number of domains. They predicted the rise of what they called narrowcasting, as opposed to broadcasting, which we would call social media today. They predicted the rise of anonymous digital cash which would be disruptive to the nation state, which we would think Bitcoin is. And it also predicted the digitization of securities, so other property rights going away from a government function to be provided via software. And one of the things that was interesting there is that they compared digital space to the high seas. Basically saying, The reason why whoever controls the high seas controls the world is because that\u2019s the most frictionless environment! You can move things with the least energy on the seas, once you can conquer them. So whoever controls that domain sort of controls the world. But also \u2014 because it\u2019s frictionless \u2014 it\u2019s very difficult to project dominion over the high seas. So we don\u2019t have law, really \u2014 we have international waters everywhere in the world! And they compare that and analogize it to digital space, where it\u2019s a frictionless space that whoever is dominant there will be dominant in the 21st century, but it will also be very difficult to project dominion. So it will be unregulated, largely! So they\u2019re using that to kind of make the case for digital cash, and the fact that people would be able to escape oppressive regimes. Once you get your capital in the digital space, you\u2019re no longer under the thumb of the government of the local oppressive monopoly. So I just think it\u2019s interesting how it just always comes down to the terrain, right?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [28:49]: Yeah. And I agree with you on that! I agree that the digital domain has weakened all the geographic terrain constraints. It\u2019s pretty clear that information is flowing across borders and even when people try to stop it, they\u2019re defeated by VPNs and anonymous browsing and other techniques! And we see places where information\u2019s illegal \u2014 it\u2019s leaking! Where it\u2019s illegal to move capital \u2014 it\u2019s leaking! Where it\u2019s illegal to move information \u2014 it\u2019s leaking! Where one person\u2019s sedition is another person\u2019s news, or truth. [inaudible 29:42] been able [inaudible] who controls the government. And that\u2019s something I wrote about in my book The Mobile Wave.

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Yeah! And we made a lot of money off it, and it did just that! It actually sent out personalized information. So I was always a big fan of that, so I think it\u2019s interesting the way that\u2019s evolving! Probably the key thing there is: technology is empowering the individual and giving them more sovereignty. And it\u2019s harder and harder in those ways for the government to control what information you get, and then how you manage your assets. But it\u2019s a very twisty, complicated subject, because the government\u2019s getting more power over you in some areas, they get less power over you in other areas, and it\u2019s spinning fast!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [30:54]: And you could argue that that trajectory that\u2019s taking us closer to a reflection of natural law, because natural law would say that sovereignty inheres within the individual. Our rights are not given to us from government, they actually inhere naturally within us. So it seems to be that \u2014 and it\u2019s complicated because we\u2019ve never seen a world like that, right? Again, we\u2019ve always needed government to sort of keep the peace and enforce contract law and satisfy property rights, but now in the digital age there\u2019s at least the possibility of some of those functions falling to software!"}

Fast-forward 1,400 years and people think the world is flat! It\u2019s like the Romans knew the world was not flat! And if they hadn\u2019t ripped his statue off the column 1,000 years earlier or whenever they ripped it off and buried it somewhere, they would\u2019ve known the world is round, and it\u2019s so ironic that you could learn and then forget such a basic thing!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: So there is the possibility of significant civilizational regression if we ignore those learnings that we\u2019ve accumulated over time."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: And think about the consequences of that insight!

It\u2019s instantly auditing itself constantly in real time!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [14:02]: And you could say, The Romans were healthy as long as they kept tension and dynamism and this incredible competition in their ecosystem, and when they lost it, they lost their edge. And then when you look at the classic Guns, Germs, and Steel-type narratives like, the Europeans, they got hardened and tougher because they were always fighting with each other and living with your animals made you tougher and having people come through from Asia made you tougher. And as soon as you try to insulate yourself from those stressors and [inaudible] forgets how to do things, or never figures it out!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [14:56]: Right! Taleb calls the stressors \u2014 [they] are the information! So you\u2019re actually cutting yourself off from the information flow that\u2019s driving your adaptation!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: So one way or the other we meandered through that, but it strikes me that it didn\u2019t have to last as long as it did! Life expectancy plunges down to 30 years, from 72 years, and a world without technology, if you don\u2019t have aqueducts and sanitation and rules like, Don\u2019t bring your horse into the middle of the village because he\u2019s gonna crap all over everything and you\u2019re going to get sick! In the absence of all those orderly rules, then you have just a degradation of the human condition! And we started to crawl out with the Renaissance, and what\u2019s interesting there I think is if you look at all of the great cities in the world, all the great cities grew as nexus, as the central node of an empire. So Rome was the nexus of an empire. Carthage was the nexus of an empire. When they lose their empire, they collapse! The only way you generate enough money to make a great city, you have to scrape a tax off of all the energy, all the commercial value, in a large place. A fisherman casts a wide net to capture the fish \u2014 that\u2019s your empire! The Roman schtick was, Pay us 10% when it comes into Rome and 10% when it goes into the next port and we\u2019ll take 20% or maybe 30% out of the value added or whatever we\u2019re gonna take. If you go into Venice and you look around the grand canal, you see all these palazzos \u2014 they\u2019re all just warehouses! I bring a ship into Venice, I off-load my cargo, and then it goes out the back and it gets barged up and down the canal, and it gets transshipped to a new ship. In that world, each ship ran this route: Venice to Alexandria was one trade route, Venice to Rome was another trade route, Venice to Istanbul was another trade route! You\u2019re at the nexus, you\u2019re running these shipping networks, and of course you\u2019ve gotta bribe the guy in Istanbul, or maybe your son marries his daughter, and that\u2019s how you get to come in and out of Istanbul without getting murdered or without getting your stuff stolen. And eventually all the families in Venice intermarry, like I know you, you\u2019re my second-cousin, that\u2019s how we don\u2019t cheat each other! And there\u2019s no way\u2014you can\u2019t solve the traveling salesman problem\u2014there\u2019s no way you can take a ship from Istanbul to Alexandria to Venice to Rome to Ibiza or wherever I would go \u2014 Barcelona \u2014 because I would basically get overtaxed or extorted in each port unless I actually was friendly! So the way that works is, you have a hub and spoke system, and there\u2019s always one central city, and there\u2019s always one set of families or companies, and they intermarry and they trust each other, and they just agree, I\u2019m gonna buy wheat for a dime in Alexandria, I\u2019m going to bring it to Venice and I\u2019m going to sell it to you for 50 cents, you\u2019re going to take it to Barcelona and sell it for $1, and you\u2019re gonna pay a nickel in tax to the guy on the other end. You\u2019re gonna get your 45 cents, I\u2019m gonna get my 45 cents, those guys get paid $1, those guys get paid a nickel. We can play with, What\u2019s the mark up, right? It might be I buy it for a quarter, sell it for 0.50 and you sell it for 0.75 to the dudes that sell it for $1. But invariably, it\u2019s the people at the center of the network that are actually getting 10, 20, 30, 50% of all the commerce! Which is all the energy! And what\u2019s the definition of a smuggler? Or a pirate? The definition of a smuggler is someone who doesn\u2019t want to give me half their stuff! So, how do I stop that? I have to have a navy that goes to kill them! So you have the Carthaginian navy stopping smuggling so they can tax half the stuff! And that\u2019s why the Romans can\u2019t \u2014 Carthago delenda est, right? \u2014 Pliny the Elder or Cato, I forget which one, said in every speech he gave in the Senate for 20 years, Carthago delenda est \u2014 Carthage must be destroyed! Why? Because two people can\u2019t shake down the same guy of half his stuff \u2014 there\u2019s nothing left! If I take half your stuff as a tax, I can\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s like the tax wars! The Carthaginians are taxing the shippers and the Romans want the money! Therefore, the Romans must defeat the Carthaginians! Now the Romans tax you, then they fall, then the Venetians rise! Now the Venetian navy controls the Med. Then you\u2019ve got \u2014 you know, you ever go to Venice, there\u2019s this great Renaissance painting, The Battle of Lepanto. And The Battle of Lepanto is when the king of Spain allies with the Pope from Rome, the head of the Roman Catholic Church, and with the Doge of Venice. And those three navies fight the Turks, the invading Muslims from Istanbul \u2014 and they beat them! And it\u2019s the triumph of Christendom! But it gets you thinking: why were they all killing each other in the first place over the Med? And you realize it\u2019s because they\u2019re fighting over control of the mercantile network! And then the next interesting observation is, you\u2019ve heard the word Roman Catholic Church, right? You ever hear the phrase, Venetian Catholic?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [21:45]: I don\u2019t think so!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: There was a time when the Venetians terminated the Catholic Church in Venice! The Catholic Church in the entire Venetian empire didn\u2019t terminate with the Pope in Rome. It terminated with the Doge in Venice! And so that means all tithes, all due, goes to Venice and stops! You can\u2019t have an empire, unless the person at the top of the empire is also in control of the religion, because if you don\u2019t control of the religion, then someone else takes half your money, you see? It\u2019s all about energy flow! And the energy is flowing \u2014 by the way, the Pontifex Maximus originally refers to the Roman consul, to the head of Rome! Augustus Caesar was the Pontifex Maximus. So the Romans had eventually the high priest. So the Roman consuls were the high priest of Rome for 700 years! If you\u2019re elected the general, you\u2019re also the priest. You run all the religious ceremonies. They didn\u2019t separate those two! So the church and the mercantile empire and the power to tax migrates from Rome to Venice. When did Venice start to decline? When they lost control of the church! At the end of the day, they start sinking, because you can\u2019t afford to maintain those buildings. You can\u2019t afford 100-story buildings in Manhattan unless you\u2019re the center of a financial empire! I have to basically buy your bonds for 68 cents on the dollar and sell them for 82 cents on the dollar and cut the difference. You know there are a lot of securities on Wall Street where there\u2019s only two market makers: there\u2019s the one bank and the other bank and they trade with each other, and if you\u2019re buying, you\u2019re buying at the top of the spread and you\u2019re selling at the bottom of the spread. And the spread is 2%, Robert! So if I turn over $1 Billion worth of bonds, I\u2019m paying $20 Million in commissions, and there\u2019s a monopoly there, and the $20 Million is just flowing into what? It\u2019s flowing into the building! My buddy works for that bank and I work for this bank and we drink together and we just kind of joke about the 200 basis point spread!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [24:34]: Interesting! So it\u2019s these groups sort of competing to be the head gatekeeper in a way. But to preserve that gatekeeping, it\u2019s intimately connected to the church \u2014 control of religion, I guess you might say. So does this somehow connect the actual connections between money and religion? Even today we have a In God We Trust on the US dollar bills?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [25:00]: It takes us to the Reformation! By the way, if you go to Amsterdam, Amsterdam is a city of canals! If you\u2019ve ever seen a distribution center, the trucks come in one side, it goes through a very complicated set of conveyors, and it goes out the other side! These trucks come from the manufacturers, those trucks go to the stores or the locales, and the distribution center is a maze of conveyors. Amsterdam\u2019s that, but it\u2019s that for barges, before we had machines. That\u2019s what Venice is! That\u2019s what they did in every mercantile center. And when you get to Martin Luther\u2019s time, you realize one of the key drivers is there\u2019s no way that we can rise or elevate our civilization if we have to send all of our money to Rome! You see this struggle throughout medieval history \u2014 William the Conqueror had that struggle, you see the struggle of the Northern European German nobles, and then of course it punctuates itself with Henry VIII, who eventually forms the Anglican church so he can be the Pontifex Maximus, and if the church terminates with the King of England, they don\u2019t have to ship any money down to Italy, nor do they have to ask permission to change their alliances and get married and do what they will. It\u2019s useful to have God on your side! [Inaudible] useful! And so that drives a lot of stuff throughout the Renaissance and you can say that Northern Europe broke off from the Roman Catholic Church for religious reasons, or you could say the Northern European powers that be created the religion for political and economic reasons, to break off from the Roman Catholic Church! But either way, it\u2019s kind of a triumph of history that everybody\u2019s forgotten that there used to be lots of \u2014 why do they call it Roman Catholic if there weren\u2019t other Catholics? How many different branches of the Catholic church do you think there were? Like, a thousand! They just kind of coalesced over time! But here\u2019s the general principle: everywhere on Earth where you see a big city, it was the center of an empire! Paris, London, Hong Kong, New York, Venice, Rome! Everywhere! And by the way, everywhere where you see a city that\u2019s fallen upon hard times, that\u2019s been destroyed \u2014 it\u2019s empire lapsed! Carthage, Troy, right? You could name them on and on and on! Venice\u2014had an empire, lost an empire. And that\u2019s because you can\u2019t physically create this kind of economic density. I mean, you go to Paris and you look at the Cathedral of Notre Dame and you look at how much human effort went into creating Notre Dame \u2014 there are people that are selling postcards and bottled water in the shadow of Notre Dame Cathedral making money off of tourists, where the guys inherited the concession from his father\u2019s father\u2019s father\u2019s father, and if you go back 10 generations, the concession was 700 years old! They are living off of the vestiges of an empire long past, and now the question is: what are the empires of the future? Where do they form? And that takes us really to the Steel Age, the 19th century, the robber barons and the like, and you can see \u2014 with shipping networks, those canals gave way to free ports and eventually gave way to container ships, and container ships totally remade everything and they shifted power to Singapore and Hong Kong and companies like Maersk. And ultimately it\u2019s a low-energy \u2014 it\u2019s a componentized way to move things around! The most efficient to move anything on Earth is modern containers! By the way, the biggest rage and technology in service today is containerized software via Kubernetes and Docker. Which is the same principle as: put all your stuff in the container ship, and then the container goes onto a ship, they get standard loading facilities into a port, they\u2019ve got standard train cars and standard trucks \u2014 everything\u2019s standardized! And the cost and the transparency of that was cut maybe by an order of magnitude with that innovation!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Right! Standardization once again! So I do have a question about these empires that we\u2019ve discussed historically: ostensibly the purpose of an empire like this is to basically preserve the walls of the city, protect the peace, honor private property rights within that dominion, enforce contract law, ensure that there\u2019s a non-violent means for dispute resolution such that commerce can be conducted fluidly. And you mentioned the Empires of the future \u2014 this is something I think about a lot, is that we\u2019ve always needed this monopolist on violence to sort of honor private property rights within their jurisdiction. But another really interesting aspect of Bitcoin is it\u2019s kind of the first private property right that is agnostic of government completely! You don\u2019t need government to enforce your right to hold private keys! It\u2019s like holding physical gold or any other bearer instrument. So I wonder how much that plays into the relevance of an empire in the historical sense going into the future?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [31:42]: Yeah a traditional empire is producing security. The #1 export in the United States is security! Like literally, I can live in Miami Beach and I don\u2019t worry about someone shooting me across the intracoastal waterway. And if I was in certain other parts of the world I\u2019d be surrounded by 100 bodyguards \u2014 so, security! They have that saying about Genghis Khan, they said, When the Mongols controlled all of Asia, a virgin could\u2019ve ridden from one end of the empire to the other with a pot of gold on her head and not be molested! The Mongols weren\u2019t screwing around either! You intercept their mail, if anything gets stolen, anybody gets hurt, they show up with an army and they murder everybody for 100 miles in every direction, trying to make the point: don\u2019t eff with the system! Now most of these empires they generally provide this kind of security for their citizens, not always for the non-citizens or the aliens or the slaves or the whatever \u2014 the underclass. But they do manage to establish them! [32:57] Bitcoin is security, and Bitcoin\u2019s #1 value proposition is security! It\u2019s security of energy. If energy is translated to money and money is translated is translated into Bitcoin and you store it on the Bitcoin network, you\u2019re securitizing your assets in a cloud of \u2014 behind a wall of \u2014 encrypted energy. And in that regard, it provides an important right and empowerment to the individual! It hasn\u2019t quite addressed the physical security element. When do we actually come up with something that will surround your person with a field of repulsive energy. Your own force field! Then you will have accomplished the same thing in the physical domain that Bitcoin does in the virtual domain. But if I secure your life force \u2014 money is energy, is life force, money is power \u2014 if I secure your power, that can be converted into physical security either by allowing you to travel away from the [threat]. We have the example \u2014 Nazi Germany in the 30's \u2014 all the Jews had their money locked up in Germany and so the way the system worked is they operated as bankers and they allowed people to launder their money out of Germany and they would take a hair cut of 10, 20, 30% initially, then 50%, then 70%, then 90%, until pretty soon it was like a 90% hair cut to get your value out, and so consequently, people didn\u2019t want to leave! And so if you don\u2019t have your monetary power or your assets secured virtually, then your physical security is always at risk because you can\u2019t leave nor can you protect yourself, right? You can\u2019t pay for anything to protect yourself, and you can\u2019t get out, or you can\u2019t pay to get out! You would think that probably one of the most useful or one of the most compelling use cases of Bitcoin would be if I\u2019m a refugee trying to flee a war zone. Because it\u2019s either that or gold, and the problem with gold is there\u2019s a lot of people with guns \u2014 they\u2019re gonna take it from you! And at least with Bitcoin, you could pay the guy with the gun half the money when you started, and the other half when you got there, and the worst he could do is blow your head off, but he\u2019s not getting the money. Whereas gold, he just blows your head off \u2014 takes the gold! So yeah I think it\u2019s second order beneficial to physical security in a lot of different ways and it makes the world better, but it\u2019s first order beneficial to economic security! If we think about the Steel Age, these rail networks are another network to deliver energy faster, stronger, smarter, harder! Of course, at the nexus of every transportation hub, there\u2019s an economic center, so rail heads \u2014 if a great city is in a port, it\u2019s at the center of a railroad juncture! And a lot of times at the center of the rail juncture you can tax all the trains! So if goods come from Spain into Paris and they\u2019re going to Germany, the French get to take a tax right there in Paris! The rail heads became a nexus. The other fascinating thing about the railroads is they became really instrumental to logistics, movement of armies, and they drove economic and political power. And one interesting example is Winston Churchill when he was like 25, he wrote a book called the River War, before he was famous for anything in fact! He was quite the adventurer \u2014 he went off to fight in the war in the Sudan under Kitchener. And the entire book is about the British working to win a war in the Sudan, and they had to take Khartoum \u2014 it\u2019s like going 1,000 miles up the Nile, maybe 1,500 miles up the Nile! \u2014 across desert, and why they would even want to do it is an interesting question, but here\u2019s the bottom line: the entire outcome of the war comes down to the question, Can the British build a railroad to Khartoum? And if the British succeed in building a railroad, they win. And if they can\u2019t build a railroad, they can\u2019t provision the army and they can\u2019t move the heavy equipment and they lose the war! The entire war \u2014 it\u2019s called the River War \u2014 but it ought to be called the Railroad War. It\u2019s just about building a railroad across the desert, and at the end of the day, as soon as the railroad arrived, a bunch of guys with explosives and Gatling guns showed up, they devastated everybody and it was not a fair fight at all! Like Gatling guns versus guys with spears and musket loaders \u2014 it\u2019s kind of very unpleasant! And if you read it through the modern view, it doesn\u2019t necessarily leave you a good taste in your mouth! But it\u2019s a reminder that a lot of times, the difference between winning and losing, and living and dying, is via railroads! I think there\u2019s a similar story in the American Civil War, if you look at the way railroads functioned. Even the conquest of the continent, the Union Pacific Railroad! Once the railroad crossed the continent \u2014 it\u2019s Manifest Destiny \u2014 you think the United States was gonna dominate without that railroad? What is it, 1,000x more expensive to move stuff over land than over water? And Google is very good at saying, We don\u2019t do anything that\u2019s gonna be 10x or 100x better \u2014 I mean it\u2019s a Silicon Valley trope. Don\u2019t bother to do it unless you\u2019re gonna break through this 100x! Well all these things were 100x better, but a railroad we take for granted! I give you 5 tons of stuff \u2014 carry it from New York to California. Count the amount of energy it\u2019s gonna take you! Now put it on a railroad car \u2014 try again! You think that\u2019s not faster? And stronger? 1,000x faster? 1,000x stronger? Something like that! Orders of magnitude. And that takes us to John D. Rockefeller. Before Standard Oil comes along, people are actually hunting whales \u2014 they\u2019re getting in wooden ships chasing around in the Indian Ocean to kill a whale, boil down its blubber and make kerosene and burn a lamp! Not a very efficient way to gather energy! So then along comes oil, and oil is 1,000x more efficient way to get energy, and what Standard Oil was, was it was first an energy producer, but it was also an energy storage device! It\u2019s a battery! Because the best way to store energy is put it in a tank! It was also an energy network. Standard Oil, they bought up all the \u2014 they didn\u2019t actually buy the fields, they bought the refineries. They refined the oil, they stored the oil, they bought up all the tanker cars, they bought up all the tanker ships, they locked down all of the networks, and they basically had an energy network! They actually had guys driving around with carriages to deliver their energy to every single retail store. They had retail distribution! They would even give away the furnaces to sell the energy! They did a Jeff Bezos thing. You know \u2014 Amazon Prime. People think Jeff Bezos invented it? He didn\u2019t invent it! He read the biography of John D. Rockefeller! Rockefeller invented it all! He did it all! He gave away the razors to sell the razor blades, he\u2019s the first guy to realize that you have to form a cartel or you have to form some kind of understanding of scarcity. If there\u2019s no scarcity, there\u2019s so much volatility that the market is chaotically destructive. So you had the world\u2019s first serious energy network there, and it\u2019s such a powerful network that 100 years after Rockefeller\u2019s dead, those companies are still around, worth $1 Trillion! They\u2019re still instrumental!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [42:38]: Yeah! What does that mean? You said that Rockefeller realized that he had to institute a cartel in order to impose scarcity on the market, such to offset volatility? Can you elaborate on that?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [42:52]: It comes in booms and busts. Like people would \u2014 you talk about scarcity. The problem with using a commodity as money is when the price goes up, people produce too much of it! Well so he \u2014 it was a very inefficient industry with massive volatility, and so he consolidated it to drop the volatility so that they could standardize every component along the way! So that he could drive to a lower energy level, a more efficient energy system. Ultimately, if you want to look at the human condition \u2014 you ever get on one of those rowing machines and you row as hard as you can for an hour, and a kilowatt-hour is hard to come by! You start to think \u2014 if I rowed all day long and I was an Olympic-level rower, I think the sum total of my effort is like 29 cents? Like, if you calculate the value of all of your human effort in modern energy cost? A quarter? A nickel \u2014 some people couldn\u2019t even do a nickel worth of work, right? And you think about where we got to, and we got through to that by channeling this energy, and it must be 1,000x, 10,000x more energy! In fact just a general theme you see everywhere where there\u2019s an explosion of innovation and an explosion of vitality, somebody tapped into a 1,000x more energy or figured out how to deliver the energy! Oil was originally all about kerosene and lighting, and then heating, and then of course the automobile shot it up by a factor of 10 and that was the killer app! But if you go on to some other industrial-era robber baron networks \u2014 here\u2019s an interesting one: Kraft, Hershey\u2019s, and Post Cereal. They\u2019re technology companies! People don\u2019t think of \u2019em as that! Before they came along, there was no breakfast. People didn\u2019t eat breakfast! Kraft and Post figured out how to box corn flakes, and what they did is they stabilized food energy and put it into a container that didn\u2019t bleed the energy, that didn\u2019t leak energy! If I give you a bottle full of tomato sauce, and I just make it in my kitchen, and you put it in your refrigerator, it will spoil over some period of time. How much? Well, there\u2019s bacteria in it. The origin of branding \u2014 the Kraft brand, the Hershey\u2019s brand, or whatever brand \u2014 the origin of branding is I make it in a clean room, hermetically sealed. Everybody has to clean up, scrub down, sterilize, get the bacteria off, I have machines to load the can, to seal the can, to seal the bottle. I stamp it with my brand! The #1 value proposition wasn\u2019t, It\u2019s good ketchup! Or it\u2019s good tomatoes or good soup or good whatever! The #1 value proposition is it\u2019s not gonna kill you! You ever actually make some leftovers and leave it in your refrigerator for 2 months and eat it? Here\u2019s a better one: why don\u2019t you make something in your kitchen, and then leave it in your closet for 2 months without a refrigerator, because they didn\u2019t have refrigerators! Frozen food came along later! And Marjorie Merriweather Post became one of the richest women of the century, a) because her father gave her Post Cereal, and they were able to stabilize starch in a box at room temperature, and then b) because she bought the first frozen food company, and she realized the ability to actually freeze food was gonna be a game-changer! And before that, no one had ever frozen food before! You think they\u2019re not technologists? It\u2019s a food energy company!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [47:46]: Energy storage technologies!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I mean, you need energy in food form, in nutritional form, to not die! If I could store it \u2014 now it\u2019s like, it\u2019s very interesting here, right? Can I take electricity from Detroit and deliver it to you in San Francisco today? No! Can I deliver electricity from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Michigan? Yes! When it gets to you, how long can you store it in your battery? It bleeds 2% a month! You\u2019ll probably lose it all in the year. Can I ship food from Detroit to Grand Rapids? Yeah. When it gets there, how long can you store it in your cellar? A day? A week? If the answer\u2019s 2 weeks, there\u2019s no national business there! There\u2019s no national brand! The answer needs to be 3 months or 6 months \u2014 now there\u2019s a national brand! Now it matters! So these guys that were launching these businesses, they were really launching clean room manufacturing plants that captured energy or something of value. They were stores of value, Robert! A store of value that would not decay or bleed due to bacterial infestation or spoilage. And because of that, the brand became important, just like the Standard brand was important \u2014 the kerosene\u2019s not gonna explode \u2014 it\u2019s clean, right? Is the gasoline clean? Is the ketchup clean? You go to Hershey, Pennsylvania, they got a factory \u2014 it\u2019s a work of art! It\u2019s more complicated than most computer programs! They wrote a computer program in steel! Like, don\u2019t eff that up, right? There\u2019s no version 2 coming \u2014 write your program in an analog computer welded in steel that takes up a football field \u2014 that\u2019s what they did! And in one end goes milk and eggs and out the other ends comes boxes of chocolate bars \u2014 50,000 an hour! And it\u2019s not just they come out perfectly uniform, it\u2019s they come out without bacteria in them and you can put them on the shelf and they won\u2019t make your kids sick! And therein is the rise of all of those CPG companies.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [50:27]: I love the perspective you have on all investment being an investment in technology! Because that is what we are doing, right? We are making tools, protocols, technologies, that basically improve our productivity, and that\u2019s how we advance is these layers of innovation on top of one another, such that basically every business is a technology business! I think that\u2019s a very unique insight I have never heard before! And I think the other thing is, the interesting connection between this hyper-sanitation \u2014 so really make sure there\u2019s no bacteria or anything that could cause harm to the user of energy \u2014 which would be the eater of the food, how the hyper-sanitation\u2019s connected to the preservation of the food, or the energy store. And that seems to somehow kind of mirror Bitcoin in a way! That it\u2019s got a hyper-sanitary ledger, right? There\u2019s never any errors in the blockchain whatsoever, such that it preserves its sanctity maximally across time.

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Just one little nuance! Just one little problem!

But you try to find a metal which is stable, that\u2019s going to be a structurally sound metal for aviation, and aluminum\u2019s the one! No aluminum \u2014 no aviation! Nothing! Nothing! You\u2019re talking about balloons, right? Or maybe you\u2019ve got the right flyer! But it\u2019s an elemental force, and on that element, you make that breakthrough, then you have a $1 Trillion industry based on that breakthrough \u2014 how do you work it, how do you create it, how do you use it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:01:44]: It\u2019s so interesting that these raw material breakthroughs then have so many follow-on consequences.

And then we have to think about how much commerce is actually conducted through the city and through the aircraft! I mean it\u2019s foundational to global civilization as we know it!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:02:12]: And they all kind of come down to networks that move energy around! Standard Oil was an energy network! The railroads are energy networks! By the way, no railroad \u2014 no tanker car with energy on it, right? The railroad is the energy network moving the oil around! The airplanes \u2014 another energy network \u2014 moving high frequency cargo around, and information around. And each one of them build on another one. And then the food networks. The result of all of them is, there are large corporations and huge opportunities for wealth creation, if you get to the node of the network! One last point on the Steel Age before we move on that\u2019s worth noting is: average life expectancy at 1900 is 50 in America! It was 70 under the Romans, it was 30 in the Dark Ages, it might have been 32\u201333 in the Revolutionary War in the US. We crawl back up to 50, and then by 1950, it\u2019s 70! And so probably the most rapid expansion in the quality of life in thousands of years is in this 50 years from 1900\u20131950, because of the conquest of infectious diseases! And that\u2019s all really a function of discovering the science of microbes and sterilization \u2014 understanding that you need to be sterile. And then the second is antibiotics. And those two things together were extraordinary! Antibiotics alone and Penicillin is responsible for the defeat of Tuberculosis, and Tuberculosis killed a billion people! The White Plague! When you caught Tuberculosis it was a death sentence! I think it killed Chopin \u2014 it killed all sorts of people! A billion people \u2014 more than any war! [1:04:27] And of course, in this particular case, if you look at history books on the 20th century, they give it like 2 paragraphs! If you were weighting the text based on the significance of what happened, something like half of all the history of the 20th century ought to be just about Penicillin, antibiotics, and sterilization \u2014 half! And everything else can be the other half! But in fact it\u2019s not even 0.01%. The only measurable mortality rate in the 20th century is the flu epidemic around 1920 where you could see a blip. You can\u2019t see an impact on the average life expectancy of any other event \u2014 including all the wars \u2014 World War I doesn\u2019t register, World War II doesn\u2019t register. It\u2019s kind of like, the impact of technology, of modern medicine and antibiotics and networks and cheap energy and sterilization and sanitation and [inaudible]. The impact of that so dwarfs every political thing that took place in the century that what you really got is I think it\u2019s just a small blip in 1920. And that was like, different estimates: 100 million people died, people say as much as 10\u201320% of the population died in that 1\u20132 year time frame, and they\u2019re still debating what that is, but it\u2019s the only event you can see on the chart, and all of the activities of all the politicians and all the ideologies and everything we fought over, turned out to be not as relevant as defeating Tuberculosis!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:06:33]: And it was derived from a Mycelium?

{"prompt": "Robert Breedlove: Hey everyone! Welcome to Episode 1 of the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show! I\u2019m your host, Robert Breedlove, and our purpose in this show in general is the pursuit of truth. We\u2019re gonna explore many topics in depth, and many of them will take us down to the proverbial Bitcoin rabbit hole, by pursuing what I call is the rabbit! And the rabbit is that question \u2014 that all-important question \u2014 \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d And this question is a seemingly inexhaustible generator of answers that have continuously reshaped my perspectives on the world. And I think they will for you as well. Our first episode is part of a long series with Michael Saylor. He\u2019s the CEO of Microstrategy. Michael is the latest and arguably the greatest proponent of Bitcoin, and an ally of this space in its battle for truth and freedom in the world. And Microstrategy is a NASDAQ-listed business intelligence firm, so Michael has very deep experience in the fields of technology, network architecture \u2014 things like this. And in fact, he was actually educated in the domain of scientific paradigm shifts and the impact of technology on civilization. And ten years ago, Michael actually wrote a book called The Mobile Wave, that depicted many of the impacts that he saw FAANG stocks would have on the world: Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google. He had laid out a case \u2014 an investment case, largely \u2014 for these companies, and their dominance in the global marketplace. And clearly over the past ten years\u2014as we sit down in 2020 \u2014 those stocks have been stand-out performers and have become in many ways the new dominant monopolies in the world today. So Michael has a very deep understanding of these topics that I think actually predisposed him to gaining a rapid understanding of Bitcoin. And as you\u2019ll see \u2014 or as you may have heard in other interviews \u2014 he really entered the Bitcoin space in 2020 and got very deep into the rabbit hole very quickly, in the wake of the COVID global lockdown situation! So Michael\u2019s a very intelligent guy, very high energy, very hard working, and I think his acceleration into the Bitcoin rabbit hole also demonstrates that a lot of this trail has been blazed for him. So a lot of Bitcoin maximalists have laid the foundation for others to gain a more rapid and clear understanding of the impact of Bitcoin. In the wake of that as you all probably know \u2014 you may have not heard \u2014 Michael\u2019s firm, Microstrategy, actually named Bitcoin as its primary treasury reserve asset. They initially invested $425 Million into Bitcoin, and that Michael personally disclosed that he holds about 17,000 Bitcoin himself, so he\u2019s got a lot of skin in the game to say the least! And I think you\u2019ll see why as we go through some of this! So in this, what we\u2019re calling The Saylor Series, we\u2019re gonna start from the first principles of energy, of anthropology, of technology, and really build a solid foundation for really gaining a deep understanding of Bitcoin\u2019s potential impact on the world. And Michael and I, to craft this series, we iterated on its discussion framework, and we finally arrived at his overarching thesis \u2014 which he was kind enough to lay out in very sophisticated form \u2014 and he goes very deep on the topics we\u2019ve laid out here, which starts very early, like Stone Age, and we go all the way into modernity! So this is a long narrative arc that\u2019s super fascinating, very interesting stuff, and clearly, it takes us some time to build up to Bitcoin, but the journey itself is purposeful and it\u2019s well worth it! So we divided the content itself into time-stamped chapters and sub-chapters which we\u2019ve chopped into a bunch of episodes. Each episode is comprised of chapters, and then two of those chapters are sub-chapters. We\u2019ll have time-stamps available both in the video bar and in the description to the video. And the early episodes will include a lot of Michael talking \u2014 so a lot of him speaking solo about his bedrock thesis on energy, anthropology, technology, things like this! And then as we build into modernity and to Bitcoin, it will become much more of a dialogue conversation as we go back and forth about Bitcoin and things of that nature. So I realize this is really long form content, but I assure you, I can promise you, you\u2019re gonna find it deeply meaningful! I myself found the feeling of chills at times, there were various epiphanies I had going through this which I\u2019ll articulate in some of the outros to the episodes. But this was just dynamite content! And I think it\u2019s a great view into the mind of Michael Saylor, and it makes a very powerful case for Bitcoin and how much it\u2019s going to reshape the world. So I promise you that you\u2019ll find \u2014 despite the time it may take you \u2014 you\u2019re gonna find this extremely intellectually satisfying, perhaps even philosophically satisfying. We go really deep on a lot of topics! So I hope you enjoy it! And I firmly believe the insights that come out of this will actually reshape your worldview! So if this is the kind of content you\u2019re interested in, and you\u2019re really interested in going deep and getting to truth, I think you\u2019re in the right place today! So with that, let\u2019s jump into Episode 1 of the Saylor Series here on the \u201cWhat is Money?\u201d Show!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [07:36]: Michael Saylor! Thank you for joining me!"}

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: It\u2019s been a busy quarter I would say! Really busy. It\u2019s been a busy year. January 1st of this year, the year started out one way, and then it became something altogether different in March, and it became something altogether different again by June! And now we\u2019re in September! I look back on it, and certainly there\u2019s a lot of things I didn\u2019t expect. I joke with people, If I\u2019d gotten what I\u2019d wanted, I wouldn\u2019t have gotten what I needed. I wouldn\u2019t have been nearly as successful if at any point in time I\u2019d got what I wanted! I\u2019m sure this is not what I wanted when I started the year, and for a while I thought it wasn\u2019t terribly a good thing, but now as we move toward the end of the year, I see the silver lining here and I\u2019m glad these things happened, which is fascinating!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [09:06]: Yeah so it sounds like the world in a lot of ways got a wake-up call this year, right? On a lot of different levels. And for you particularly it was the melting ice you were sitting on, that maybe started to melt a little bit faster!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: You know there\u2019s quotes from Lenin\u2019s era. There\u2019s Trotsky\u2019s quote: You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you! And this year we launched one war on COVID, and another war on currency. And so we were caught up in kind of two wars, in two dimensions. And then there\u2019s Lenin\u2019s quote: There are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks when decades happen. And this was that year in both of those ways! I\u2019m grateful that our company is an enterprise software company \u2014 our value proposition is we ship software to large enterprises to help them think better! And the value proposition is intact, even improved, by all of the changes this year. And our cost structure and our operational systems \u2014 the way we operate \u2014 were dramatically impacted, and we had to adjust. But I would say, this was the year that digital transformation went from being a bromide or a dalliance, to being something that you really had to internalize! This was the year that digital transformation really did transform you at the core of your being. I mean, it transformed my ideas about: money, sales, marketing and services, what product offering we should deliver to the market, the marketplace in the future in general. And it\u2019s been thrown around, it\u2019s been a buzzword for a decade \u2014 maybe for two or three decades! But this is the year when you got it viscerally in your bones, if you had been dragging your feet the least amount!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [11:32]: Great points there! As if the world wasn\u2019t changing quickly enough \u2014 as we\u2019ve progressed further into this digital age \u2014 it\u2019s as if COVID was just a massive accelerant on the entire process! So not only are things transforming much more quickly now, moving to digital much more quickly, but are likely to change even more quickly, exponentially so, into the future! With that, the theme of this conversation today is deep conversations! And I know you\u2019re a deep thinker, and I really appreciate the media work that you\u2019re doing, and the voice that you brought to the Bitcoin community. I\u2019d like to jump in, kind of like a first principles look at history, and what got us to today? What got us to this digital age that\u2019s changing so quickly? And where do we see it going? And I know you\u2019ve thought deeply about this, and maybe we could start just at the beginning, so to speak, with the story of technology?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [12:45]: Okay! Well I mean the phrase that runs through my head is, There has never been such a thing as a fair fight! Humans have been struggling for millions of years, right? In order to rise, first to become the apex predator in nature, but if you look at our struggle against nature, there\u2019s never been such a thing as a fair fight! I remember seeing eagles fly along a mountainside that\u2019ll hone in on a goat, and it focuses on a baby goat, not the parent goat \u2014 catches it from behind, grabs its foot, and drags it off a cliff, and then backs off and waits while the goat goes bang, bang, bang, and hits rocks every fifty feet and is smashed to death five-hundred feet below, where the eagle circles down, lands on the goat, eats it \u2014 leisurely! Nothing fair about it! You know, you feel sorry for the goat, and then you realize, this is not a human being! This is nature! It\u2019s not fair! Then you see lions \u2014 and it\u2019s not like one lion chases down one gazelle \u2014 it\u2019s eight lions chase sixty-seven gazelles into a channel with three other lions waiting! And one gazelle is forced to take the right side because it gets crowded out by the other sixty gazelle, and that one\u2014bam! \u2014 it\u2019s dead for no reason other than that it just happened to be on the right side of the herd, and there\u2019s nothing fair about it! Nature\u2019s not fair, and when you think about the plight of Man the amazing thing is we actually evolved to be the apex creature on this planet! Now because a single individual, on their own, has almost no chance! There\u2019s that scene in Jurassic Park, and there\u2019s the bully, and he just is mean to the little dinosaur creature, some kind of small raptor, and he\u2019s like the size of a little dog and he kicks it around, and he\u2019s a bully and a sadist! And there\u2019s this part where he gets trapped in the park\u2014he\u2019s walking and he sees that little creature, and it nips at its legs and he kicks it, and then he turns around and he sees its got a friend and there\u2019s two of \u2018em! And he looks around again and there\u2019s four of \u2018em! And then they jump on him and he knocks them off and there\u2019s sixteen of \u2018em! And then they all jump on him and he fights them off and he gets up and he runs and now there\u2019s thirty-two of them! The human being\u2014the modern American that lives in their world of shopping centers and cars and air-conditioned houses and locked doors and 911 and policemen they can call and feeling safety \u2014 they look at nature through a zoo! And they look through the bars and that\u2019s nature! Or it\u2019s in paintings and it\u2019s all just so romantic! Right? They don\u2019t have this view of nature! The view when there\u2019s sixty-four of those things \u2014 and the horrifying realization that that guy is as sure as dead! He\u2019s a dead man walking \u2014 he\u2019s gonna die! There\u2019s not a damn thing he can do, it doesn\u2019t matter if he has a bazooka, it doesn\u2019t matter if he has a machine gun! It doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 he\u2019s going to die! At some point, in the next 48 hours, he\u2019s going to fall asleep and they\u2019re going to eat him! And that\u2019s the human condition! So when you think about that 3 million years ago the first question is, How did we even make it here? It\u2019s pretty obvious that, in that circumstance, if you\u2019re alone \u2014 you\u2019re dead. You\u2019re gonna have to have someone guard your back. And my heart goes out to that Adam and Eve wherever they were \u2014 you needed two, three four \u2014 you needed a tribe. You needed someone to watch, because when you fall asleep, something is going to eat you! Watch a pack of wolves hunt! The one that kills you? Isn\u2019t attacking from the front! You\u2019re not going to get to fight it off! It\u2019s gonna be an asymmetric attack from the rear, while you\u2019re asleep! And so, the importance of human beings using their brains and thinking is incredibly important! And you start to think about \u2014 how do we survive in a hostile universe? We have to figure out how we can get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! And that takes us to the beginning of Man, so if I look back at Stone Age technology and you ask, How do we even emerge from this incredible, terrifying scrum? There\u2019s just key technologies that you decide you kind of like in a hurry! One of them is fire. One of them is missiles. One of them is hydraulics. There\u2019s a lot more that we could talk about, but if we start with fire: fire is like the prime energy network of the human race! It all started for us with channeling energy. Fire\u2019s a chain reaction where we\u2019re releasing a latent energy in matter \u2014 we\u2019re converting matter into energy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [18:52]: Which is like the stored sunlight that we\u2019re releasing, right?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Yeah stored sunlight\u2014you\u2019re that human being, and you want to rise above the tigers and the packs of wolves and the other creatures and the snakes in the jungle. How are you gonna do that? You\u2019re going to have to tap into and channel energy! And that\u2019s why Prometheus has such an incredible mythic place. Prometheus is to Satoshi as fire is to Bitcoin! Bitcoin\u2019s a fire! It\u2019s a fire in cyberspace! And most people don\u2019t realize it, but it has its antecedents, right? And fire came along first, and when you think about what it means \u2014 and most people don\u2019t necessarily think very hard about it , you always had it \u2014 if you\u2019re an individual, what can you do with fire? Well, you can start by starting a fire so you don\u2019t freeze to death! That\u2019s pretty useful! The fire will scare away the animals. So I start the fire, I can sleep around it, I can not freeze. I can also put it around my camp and maybe like a snake that would\u2019ve slithered in and eaten me will go away. I can scare away insects and smoke away insects with it \u2014 that\u2019s useful! I can hunt with it! I can start a fire, and I can drive the prey away from the fire. And if I\u2019m smart, I drive the prey from fire off the cliff! I wait for them to trip, I go to the bottom of the cliff, I find one that broke its neck. You ever get in a fight with a horse? Or a fight with a hippopotamus? Or an elephant? It\u2019s not gonna end well! This idea of heroic hand-to-hand combat is a great idea in the movies! It\u2019s an awful idea in reality! And if you went back a million years, you would find that your great-great-great-great-great-grandparent thought you were pretty frickin\u2019 stupid to fight hand-on-hand with anything or anyone! So I hunt with it \u2014 I cook with it! There\u2019s a lot of biologists and the paleotheorists that make a very compelling argument that human anatomy actually evolved because we mastered fire. And when you\u2019re cooking something, you\u2019re pre-digesting it. And if you pre-digest something, not only do you increase the scope of the foods that you can consume, you also accelerate and you also increase the efficiency with which you can convert that food into calories by a factor of 10:1 or 20:1! And if you can actually metabolize the food 10x more efficiently, your digestive tract shortens, and the energy that your body expends in order to digest food can be redirected \u2014 probably to your brain! Right? Animals that don\u2019t cook food have small brains! A human being that can cook food can have a very short digestive tract, can eat anything\u2014we\u2019re omnivores \u2014 we can go anywhere, we can metabolize calories that are very efficient. It only takes us 10 or 15 minutes a day to get all the calories we need! There are animals that have to graze all day to get the calories they need! So fire is critical for that. It\u2019s critical for seeing! You channel your fire and you can light up a cave, a camp, a tent, you can light up anywhere. And with seeing comes communicating. You ever travel through the ancient world you see they have all these watchtowers! The Romans built watchtowers! You put a fire in the tower, you can see it for miles and miles away! You create a signal system! A certain presumptive arrogance or ignorance among modern men \u2014 we think kind of everything worth doing was done in the past 2,000 years or 3,000 years. I kind of figure 100,000 years ago, people were doing all of this stuff! We might not have the writings of it, but they were pretty smart! So I\u2019m gonna use the fire for all of those things and eventually for communicating, but once I figure that out, I can use it for hardening, right? I can cook things, I can harden the tip of a spear, I can use it to work metals \u2014 eventually we used it to work metals, and that ushered us from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. Fire is intrinsic to all sorts of manufacturing processes. And of course \u2014 I give you 1,000 acres of forest, Robert \u2014 how are you gonna clear it?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [24:06]: Sounds like fire would be the easiest way!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Tractor, in 100,000 B.C.? Fire! You\u2019re gonna burn it! I see these discussions, Oh! Well paleo-man, they\u2019re all hunter-gatherers and they\u2019re all just like walking around chasing after things that are running away from them! I doubt it! Like if I dropped you into 100,000 B.C., I don\u2019t think you would\u2019ve \u2014 solo \u2014 chase after a bunch of stuff with four legs! I think you would start by finding a canyon and start a fire on one end and dig a trench on the other end and let a mastodon trip on it and break its neck!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [24:52]: It\u2019s sort of life\u2019s way to take the most energy-efficient strategy, right? That\u2019s why the eagle drags the goat off a cliff and lets gravity do its work. Instead of trying to fight it out! And it\u2019s interesting that you bring up fire and it\u2019s almost as if we were using it to energize our strategies in the world. I think as you put it earlier, channeling energy through our intellect. I think the one piece that maybe we didn\u2019t hit on as much is the intellect itself developed through trade and interaction. That\u2019s how we are more than the sum of our parts is through our cooperation. And that\u2019s at the kernel of all economics, right? We have these ideas, we swap them, they become better over time, and we get to energize better and better strategies."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [25:43]: The phrase, You\u2019re playing with fire \u2014 be careful you might get burned? And what makes human beings unique is, as far as I can see, they\u2019re the only animal that plays with fire! And from the point we started to play with fire, we started to evolve at a very rapid rate. Genetically, intellectually, sociologically we evolved. And we talk about the fire of truth and the fire of faith. It\u2019s like the keeper of the flame. The keeper of the flame really means something when you have a city, a village, a civilization, a tribe, and you\u2019ve got a fire and it goes out, you might very well die! You don\u2019t want that fire to go out, at all! Bitcoin and the Bitcoin blockchain is a fire! We don\u2019t want it to go out either! We talk about feeding the fire of Bitcoin and we talk about feeding the fire of faith and simply being the keeper of the flame. It was an old idea thousands and thousands of years ago. I suspect it\u2019s the difference between life and death for humanity for a million years! You\u2019ve started the fire\u2014it\u2019s all good! But now once you go back 100,000 years you\u2019d be running around in 42 degree temperature while it\u2019s raining on you! Or what happens when it goes to 20 degrees? If it\u2019s cold and you\u2019re wet and the fire goes out, you\u2019re going to die! It\u2019s not an academic thing \u2014 it\u2019s a serious thing! So human beings harnessed fire and it made all the difference, and then along comes the next set of thoughts. If you can harness fire, maybe you can develop a brain, and maybe you\u2019ll live long enough to use it. The next observation is: you ever wrestle around with a lion or a tiger or a bear? Pick any animal that you wish to kill \u2014 you ever wrestle with a dog that weighs 80 lbs? Not easy! Would you like to fight with one? How do you feel about fighting with ten? How do you feel about trying to run one of these things down? I read about in Runner\u2019s World, runners want to tell you about how humans were always made to run, because ancient mankind chased its prey and it could run 20\u201330 miles a day, and we just run them down until they get tired! Okay well that\u2019s one idea, and maybe we did. But you ever try to catch something that\u2019s running away from you while you\u2019re hungry around dinner time? I don\u2019t really want to run for 20 hours straight until I tire it to death \u2014 I have a better idea, which is hit it with a missle! And by the way I literally mean missles! I mean a primitive sling or an arrow, and I think they found arrowheads that go back 100,000 years! They\u2019re old! Most people think of the slightshot and they think about the kid\u2019s slingshot with the rubber band and the [leg] that kids play with.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [29:16]: This is more like David and Goliath\u2019s sling, right?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Yeah if you study Roman history and you go back 1,000 years before Rome, they had slingers. I mean the Balearic Islands like Ibiza they were very famous for slingers. And if you read about them what they\u2019ll say in the ancient texts is, the natives of the Balaeric Islands were raised from age 3. Before they could speak they were raised to operate a sling. The sling is about 6\u20138 feet long, it\u2019s made of animal fiber, and you know, you don\u2019t throw a baseball \u2014 and you\u2019ve seen highlights, right? \u2014 if I increase the lever at the end, if your arm was 12 feet long, you\u2019d generate some serious leverage. A whip action! So those slings give the average person the equivalent of a 10-foot long arm, and they practice with those for years, from age 3! You can imagine after 15 years of practicing, you get pretty good! And they weren\u2019t slinging little light stones or the shit that you pick up on the seashore. They\u2019re actually forming lead bullets! Everybody thinks, Oh yeah! Bullets are from guns! Well they\u2019re not! I mean, people invented bullets thousands of years before guns! Guns were just the latest idea putting bullets together with gunpowder! The lead bullets probably came along 10,000 B.C. And maybe more, maybe 100,000 B.C.! This is a straightforward idea \u2014 if your life depended upon it, you would figure it out. And the figuring out is, you get yourself a very condensed bullet, you put it in the sling. You ever see a good pitcher? A good pitcher can place the ball 90 feet away plus or minus 4 inches? Can a good pitcher hit you in the head if you\u2019re standing at the plate? Now imagine someone that\u2019s pitching a 1\u20131.5 inch lead bullet from 50 yards away that can hit you on the head every time! Because the Romans said they could! So now think about \u2014 and this is how bad it is, right? We\u2019ll talk about this in a bit, but to make the point, these guys could stand 100\u2013200 meters off, and from 200 meters off they could actually hit an animal on the head, or another human being in the head. I mean it didn\u2019t matter if they hit you on the head \u2014 if they hit you on the torso they\u2019re gonna rupture your ribs and you may have organ failure! There\u2019s even stories \u2014 Livy, when he writes about the Second Punic War, he writes about Roman slingers, and they sling so many of these things that they pretty much break all the bones of the Gauls beneath their armor! They\u2019re wearing leather armor \u2014 their ribs are broken. And if they\u2019re not wearing leather armor and they get hit, just like getting hit with a bullet in your helmet it may still give you a concussion. It was never a fair fight! Try taking your 8-foot long spear and having a fair fight with a wolf or a pack of wolves? No. A bear? No. Humanity wouldn\u2019t be here if we hunted or defended ourselves using spears or using \u2014 these close quarter swords and clubs \u2014 they\u2019re all very romantic and they film well in Hollywood movies, in gladatorial combat because you\u2019ve got the two adversaries that are in the same frame, but if you go back a million years, the adversaries were never in the same frame! If you made it this far and you were a human being, you mastered the art of death from above! I mean, killed from a distance and nobody knew that you were there! Not a modern invention. Not only would you stand back 50 meters or 100 meters, you would stand up \u2014 and by the way, you would be up at the top of the hill where you have gravity working for you \u2014 that gives you more range. You would be back. If you were really smart, Robert, if I told you there\u2019s a bunch of whatever creature on the plain and any one of them can eat or trample you, wouldn\u2019t you like to stand up 20 feet on a cliff that they cannot run up? Stand up 20 feet above them, wait for them to come by, blast them either with a sling or use a bow and arrow, and if you miss \u2014 what happens if you miss?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [34:37]: Load up and try again, right?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: How many chances do you get? Till you run out of bullets. Now what happens if you walk down on the plain with your beautiful spear and sword with all of your buddies standing next to you and fight it out?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Risk of ruin! You can never take that on. I think this is very interesting and it also highlights another difference that we have from animals. I know that humans are one of the few animals that rely on visual acuity as their primary sense. I think it\u2019s humans and predatory birds. And that also comes down to our dexterity, right? Our ability to handle and manipulate bow and arrows, slings, these types of missile weapons. It just highlights the difference with us and everyone else. And those two things too are both intimately related with speech and thought and other tool-making, so I think that\u2019s very interesting!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [35:36]: You think of the idea of missiles \u2014 I need my eyes, my brain, I need to set up the kill zone. Oh by the way I left off one other observation: it\u2019s 500,000 years ago \u2014 you want to kill something, you\u2019re downwind from it, the sun is to your back, you\u2019re above it, and you have a missile. And hopefully you have a chance! It\u2019s like, you really want to live, you\u2019re gonna go find that spot! You\u2019re gonna say, At this point in the day, the sun is gonna be to my back, the prevailing winds are going to be blowing in my face, I\u2019m going to be 20 feet up, oh there\u2019s a path up here but guess what, I\u2019m gonna block that path because I don\u2019t want the bear running up to eat me once I start [shooting]. Then I\u2019ve got a hundred missiles, and again, it\u2019s not a fair fight. There\u2019s only two types of human beings: there\u2019s the type that figured that out and that\u2019s your grandparents, and there\u2019s the type that were a bit sloppy about one of those things and they didn\u2019t make it!

I\u2019m gonna paraphrase here but he said, Terrain is the most important aspect of any battle. It\u2019s almost like the smart general only goes into battle essentially knowing that he\u2019s won based on these preparations that you\u2019re describing, right? The sun at your back, wind at your back, high on the hill, undercover, plenty of missiles."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [37:18]: Technologies that are dominating today, they\u2019re dominating because they\u2019re able to deliver force faster, harder, stronger, smarter! If you\u2019re going to dominate, how do you deliver force harder, faster, stronger, smarter? And I could think of a hundred examples in history and they all \u2014 you tend to see those things, so if it\u2019s got the characteristic that it can be made harder, smarter, stronger, faster, there\u2019s something compelling about it! That\u2019s why digital gold is thousands of times better than gold! Because you\u2019ve got all those dimensions to work on! That\u2019s why the natural creature \u2014 gold is a rock, a bear is a bear, a mastodon is a mastodon. They\u2019re not getting harder, faster, stronger, smarter, they\u2019re just doing what they do! Human beings are! But only because of innovation! So missiles are just a tool but they\u2019re illustrative. Fire is an energy network and an energy source! It\u2019s a battery. An energy source and you can deliver it in a certain way. And then that takes us to hydraulics, which is power from water, and water is a network. And we talk about elemental forces: fire and water. Well, you ever look at the ocean, and what the ocean does \u2014 wave action is incredible energy. But another source of energy is buoyancy. You every try to pick up a 2,000 lb weight and carry it on your back, up a hill? Or just across! Put a 2,000 lb weight on a carriage, put it on the back of a donkey, drag it onto skids \u2014 problem, right? And this particular case can\u2019t be solved with fire, we can\u2019t easily burn it! On the other hand, if you needed to move 2,000 lbs you put it on a barge, you put it in the water, and the water pushes back 2,000 lbs, and I can push it with one hand! And the mastery of hydraulics is fascinating! I went to MIT. MIT\u2019s mascot is a beaver! And we have rings that have the beaver on \u2019em, and we talk about, Why have you got a beaver? The answer is, the beaver is nature\u2019s engineer! And the beaver is this near-sighted, short, waddling creature. It shows up, looks around, sees the water flowing. It can just be what, bobcat bait or whatever, their dinner, or it can do something about it! And what the beaver does it just pretty unbelievable! The beaver starts chopping down trees! First the beaver figures out where to chop down the trees, then the beaver chops down the trees, then the beaver turns the tree into a dam, then the beaver channels the river into the dam, creates a pond, floods the pond. It\u2019s like it\u2019s reading the terrain! After it\u2019s got the pond it creates a lodge in the middle of the pond with an entrance underwater, and then it creates its life in that lodge. That pond-water \u2014 water is elemental to life, and that pond creates a vibrant ecosystem and in that ecosystem lots of things grow. And lots of creatures benefit, I mean the ecological diversity improves, and it\u2019s good for all the plant life, the wildlife \u2014 people lament the loss if the beaver screws up forests, and the beaver is just doing its thing and if there\u2019s a storm and the dam gets messed up, the beaver swims out in the middle of the thunderstorm or hurricane or whatever it is and fixes the dam! It\u2019s a very industrious creature! And you just sit back and you\u2019re in awe. You think, Huh? How did a creature figure that out? And then what does that mean to humanity? Of course, it means a lot to humanity! I\u2019ve been all over the world, and I\u2019ve been to the desert, I\u2019ve been to Riyadh, I\u2019ve been to UAE, I\u2019ve been to Singapore, I\u2019ve been to Miami Beach. People think oil is money! They think oil is power! And let me tell you: oil is not really power, it\u2019s not wealth. Water is wealth! Water is the key to life! If I gave you $10 Billion and as much land as you wanted in the desert, you can\u2019t create life! The cost for you to create a pond in the desert, the cost for you to actually create a park with oak trees \u2014 if I gave you $10 Billion and you lived in the desert, Robert, what would you do with the money? What\u2019s the first thing you would do?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [43:13]: Buy Bitcoin and exit the desert?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Spoken like a progressive! So let\u2019s parse that: what if you didn\u2019t know about Bitcoin and I gave you the $10 Billion and you lived in the desert?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: I guess you\u2019d be looking for trading partners with water."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: You\u2019d exit the desert, right? So what do they do? You buy yourself a jet, you buy yourself a villa in the south of France. You buy yourself a yacht that floats in the Med. And then you figure out how to live your life, because the cost to grow a palm tree in the desert is $20,000 a year! You want 100 palm trees \u2014 it\u2019s $2 Million a year to have 100 palm trees! You want 4 acres of grass in the desert? You have $100 Million a year? For 10 acres of grass? By the way, you still can\u2019t have it! Even if you spent $100 Million a year to put 10 acres of grass in the desert, the sandstorm comes! And it wipes you out! Water is elemental to life. We underestimate how important it is! Until you start paying to create it. Yeah you can stay alive in the desert, but a person making $50,000 a year that lives in a city that has parks and rainfall and a nice temperature lives better than a billionaire in the desert! It\u2019s just that powerful. Now coming back to hydraulics. Hydraulics will generate power, right? I can harness running water running down a hill and create a turbine, then I can create a mill with that \u2014 that\u2019s interesting. Again back to the hunter-gatherer thing. If you dropped me 100,000 years ago and you said, Okay well Mike, use your brain! Go hunt and gather! I\u2019d be like, Screw that! What would I do? I would go find a stream with a little bit of elevation, maybe a mountain stream that had fresh water \u2014 you can drink it. And I\u2019d find a big enough one that had fish in it, and then I would find a point where I could divert the stream to create a pond \u2014 I mean if the beaver can do it, I can probably do it! I would do some digging, I would divert the stream, I would create a lock, and at that point in the year when the salmon or whatever are running I might just flip that lock and I would actually divert the stream into my pond and create myself \u2014 maybe it\u2019s a 100-foot wide pond, maybe it\u2019s a 20-foot wide pond, maybe it\u2019s a 300-foot wide pond. Maybe I would waste a lot of the water \u2014 I don\u2019t care! And I would let 500 of those little fishies get trapped in my pond! I\u2019m not chasing after them with the stick like in Blue Lagoon! There\u2019s no such thing as a fair fight! I\u2019m not fishing with the hook! My idea of fishing is with dynamite! I\u2019m gonna blow up everything in the lagoon, and I\u2019m gonna walk and pick up the fish. But in the absence of dynamite, I\u2019m just gonna divert the water. What\u2019s the flow rate of water? How many fish swim by you? I want them all! Put them in the pond, then what do you think I\u2019m gonna do? I\u2019m gonna go pull out one a day! And I\u2019m gonna let the other fishies swim around, and if the winter comes and the pond freezes over, that\u2019s okay! I\u2019m gonna chip a little hole in the pond and I\u2019m gonna walk out every day and I\u2019m gonna reach in and grab my fish and I\u2019m gonna eat my fish and I\u2019m not chasing after stuff! When you chase after stuff you twist your ankle and if you break your ankle you\u2019re dying! Right? If you chase after stuff and then a wolf pack catches you from behind, or you piss off an angry mastodon. So hydraulic power, it\u2019s the water, it\u2019s gonna bring you something to drink, it\u2019s gonna bring you something to eat. Maybe if I\u2019m worried about the little creepy crawly creatures or whatever, I\u2019m going to dig a trench around where I live, and they\u2019re gonna have to cross the water to get to me. Maybe I use water \u2014 a moat. If I live on the seashore, I\u2019m gonna find a natural tidal basin. And in that tidal basin, I\u2019m gonna let creatures crawl in! I went to Maine once. You ever watch lobstermen?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [48:21]: I\u2019ve seen it on TV, never in person though!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: So if you don\u2019t know anything about lobstermen, you\u2019d think, Oh well these are guys out hunting lobsters with the trap! When you go watch the lobstermen operating, you realize, they\u2019re not hunting lobster, they\u2019re not catching lobster \u2014 they\u2019re farming lobster! Big difference! They\u2019ll create a trap, they\u2019ll put some kind of herring or something in the trap that the lobster wants to eat, they\u2019ll drop it, they\u2019ll put 10 of those cages down, and then they wait! Lobsters are lazy, lobsters crawl into the cage, they grab the food, they get stuck in the cage. They pull the trap up, they find a big lobster, they keep that one. They find little lobsters, they throw them back in because they need them to keep growing. They\u2019re creating agriculture to feed the lobster, the lobsters living in happy lobster hotels their entire life \u2014 it\u2019s not so bad, Robert! If I said to you, I\u2019m gonna give you free room and board to age 70 and then I\u2019m gonna eat you! Well, not so compelling! But if I said to you, Robert, I\u2019m gonna give you free room and board until you\u2019re 750 years old, and then your life is gonna end, or, you can make it on your own and you\u2019ll suffer a horrific death being eaten up by a barracuda at age 35, you might think it\u2019s not so bad living in your lobster hotel 10 times longer than you live naturally! It\u2019s not like these lobsters would\u2019ve made it very far! They\u2019re liking it!

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [50:50]: The Pyramids got built 2,000 years before Cleopatra and Caesar. How\u2019d they haul it up there? And some of the most fascinating videos I\u2019ve seen on YouTube are those YouTube videos that show how they built hydraulic elevators to move the 2-ton or 4-ton stone up by floating it up the channel to the side of the pyramid!

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: You have a tube of water. If I put something in the bottom of the tube that\u2019s lighter than water with a float attached to it \u2014 I\u2019d put a rock with a float, maybe you\u2019d take animal skins and you blow them up with air, it will float up the tube and pop out the back! So what you do, is have the tube be able to hold the integrity. I can\u2019t do it for 1,000 feet, but I can do it for 20 feet. It\u2019s like the way a lock works in a canal, like I\u2019m going into a lock, I close the gate, I flood the lock, it lifts the barge, I open the other lock, and I got out! So imagine a series of locks that I use to actually life 100,000 tons of stone using water! Very interesting! I think that that\u2019s how it was done in my opinion. But water can be used for farming, for fishing, it can be used for security. It can be used for sanitation! In fact, without understanding water and the dynamics of water, there is no cradle of civilization in the Aegean or anywhere! I\u2019ll give you another interesting vignette.

And when it gets dry and this stuff desiccates and it blows through the air, you\u2019re going to be breathing it, smelling it, it\u2019s just going to be awful! So, you want to drink it and eat it? I mean, this is not just a matter of creature comfort \u2014 you\u2019re gonna die! You can\u2019t actually bring together a bunch of human beings unless you work out the sanitation problem! And it was then and there that it dawned on me very viscerally, there\u2019s a reason why all the streets in Mykonos are so narrow that you can\u2019t get a horse or a cart through them! They\u2019re walking cities! There\u2019s a reason that the equestrian class were the Roman knights. The knights were the equestrian class, and what it meant in Ancient Rome was the top 1%, or the top 0.1%. The nobles of Rome were the equestrian class. What it meant to be rich and powerful was: you had the right to bring a horse into the city. Nobody else could! The problem was not that they couldn\u2019t afford the horses. The problem is if they allowed anybody to bring a horse into the city, it would be so unsanitary as to render the city uninhabitable! So most ancient cities, if you wanted them to work, you would have to have them human-powered, and now you\u2019ve got this dilemma of how do you move goods around? Tell me, how do I move things around cleanly? I need a clean energy source that is not going to foul my sanitary system, that it\u2019s not gonna actually kill me! And of course it\u2019s a boat! What do you want? You want 25 cities with ports on an inland sea with at least a season 6\u20139 months a year where you can cross from one point to another point without being bashed and killed on the rocks. So you need a fairly mild sea, but you have to have water, because if you have the same 25 cities on land and you\u2019re gonna use horse or animal power in order to move goods and services back and forth, it\u2019s just so dirty, so unsanitary, that your civilization\u2019s probably not gonna get off the ground!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [58:04]: So the Mediterranean was ideal for this it sounds like!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: The Mediterranean is the perfect ocean, because you can oftentimes navigate without leaving the sight of land. It\u2019s hard to get too lost. There\u2019s a lot of ports.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Very placid, relatively."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: And there\u2019s a lot of stops. If you look at all of these empires: the Phoenician empire, the Roman empire, the Venetian empire, the British empire, if you actually tour all the great ports in the Mediterranean \u2014 all the really good ones \u2014 the story goes something like this. Maybe you go to Bonifacio in Corsica. Well in 1,000 A.D. this was the Phoenician port. And then the Greek empire came along and it was an Athenian port, 500 A.D. And then the Carthaginians kicked them out and it was a Carthaginian port. And then the Romans kicked them out and there was a Roman port. And then after the Romans stole them the Venetians took this over it was a Venetian port. And then eventually it became a British port, you know? That\u2019s the story of Malta, that\u2019s the story of Corfu, that\u2019s the story of lots of different ports in the Mediterranean. And the reason why is, if you want to dominate the Mediterranean, you need to have a port within one or two days\u2019 sail that you can hide in whenever the mistrals blow. And if you control that network of ports when the weather goes bad, you go into the port and your ship doesn\u2019t get sunk! And if you don\u2019t and you\u2019re like a week away from a port that\u2019s friendly and the weather gets bad, you get dashed against the rocks and you just die! And that\u2019s the end of it. So these are all nautical networks and they\u2019re all based upon terrain. And the Mediterranean was a good crucible for the beginning of a civilization. And when you put together the incredible power of hydraulic transportation and then you consider the consequences of not having it, you realize: you can\u2019t really develop the economic density. We haven\u2019t touched much on agriculture. We could but the general theme is the same: when I drop you and you find a fruit tree, you\u2019re not gonna go, Oh duh! There\u2019s a fruit tree in this clearing! I\u2019m gonna walk 18 miles to the place where I can find a different fruit bush. And then I\u2019m gonna walk 5 miles back to the place where the fish are! You\u2019re gonna actually pick up a fruit tree and plant like 100 fruit trees next to your fishing pond! You\u2019re not stupid! Like, paleolithic man there\u2019s every reason to believe they were smarter, stronger, and tougher than we were!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: I think it\u2019s a great point that all of these inventions were leading towards increasing economic or energetic density, and that\u2019s what actually provided the bedrock on which to build a civilization. So I was trying to get a quick overview and feel free to jump in if I\u2019m missing anything, but: it started out with, We can\u2019t handle an animal one-on-one. It\u2019s kind of our wits that make us who we are! Through our wits, we\u2019re able to communicate and coordinate with one another. One thing we didn\u2019t get into is the Yuval Harari Sapiens thesis where he says that, Man came to dominate the world because we can tell and believe stories! Like we\u2019re actually able to abstract and represent reality in symbols, and that\u2019s what gives us the ability to make tools, and so on and so forth. So with those strategies that are often cooperative, we\u2019ve energized them with fire as our base \u2014 I guess we\u2019re harnessing the energy of the world and ancient sunlight through using fire \u2014 and then the other interesting thing about fire is that it actually accelerated our own evolution, right? Our cognitive development was increased because we\u2019re able to liberate more calories from food and whatnot. It also gave us the ability to make harder, stronger, better tools in terms of metalworking. I think that\u2019s a great point too, is that mankind actually changes his own course of evolution through the conscious decisions we make, like the tools we make in turn make us! Which I think is a really interesting point to touch on later as well with money. And then we had missiles, so we could actually take advantage of our visual acuity, which is something unique to people \u2014 and our dexterity \u2014 and actually hunt animals at a distance, and hunt them on a terrain that\u2019s advantageous to us. Then we had to tap into water, because we are water first of all \u2014 humans are 70% water \u2014 we have to consume a lot of water very frequently. I think that\u2019s the quickest way to die! It\u2019s like oxygen first \u2014 we have to have that most frequently \u2014 water second \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: 3 minutes without air, 3 days without water, 3 months without food.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Exactly! And I\u2019ve read too that people going without water actually cry tears of blood \u2014 it\u2019s actually one of the symptoms \u2014 it makes your eyes bleed. So not only is water clearly this life-giving substance that we have to have access to fresh water and be able to implement into our agricultural systems and whatnot, but it\u2019s also a tool for overcoming gravity, so we can actually construct larger-scale structures and conduct commerce at scale! So I think that\u2019s a great first principles view on what makes us unique!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: And we gotta do all of that to get to the Iron Age! And we come back to this issue being harder and stronger. We harness that fire and we start to work metals and we move into bronze and we move into iron, and I think the Roman Empire is a great model for the way that human beings interact with technology and the way that they interact with a competitive world and become both antifragile and get harder, smarter, faster, and stronger! This same thing was going on in other parts of the world, but I\u2019ll focus upon Romans for a bit! You go read Livy\u2019s History of Rome and he writes about the Roman republic had 700 good years! 700 years before even it went to empire! And we started with this idea of Roman politics. You\u2019ve heard the phrase, Beware the Ides of March, in Julius Caesar, and people think of it as, Oh, well that\u2019s when someone\u2019s gonna kill Caesar, but it\u2019s really referring to the fact that for 700 years, the Romans got together on March 15th and had an election, every year! The Romans were the most organized of all of the civilizations we can find in the ancient world and that\u2019s how they grew to dominate \u2014 they were just organized! One of their forms of organization is \u2014 and this is a thing of beauty \u2014 they\u2019re running a process where every year, Marh 15th they have their election. They appoint two consuls, they appoint all of their officers. The consuls then, they conduct about 2 weeks worth of religious ceremonies. They all worship, they appease the gods, they\u2019re getting psyched up. They\u2019re reminding themselves that they\u2019re unique \u2014 they\u2019re celebrating! Simultaneously they raise an army. They train the army! We go from March 15th all the way through to May 1st \u2014 6 weeks. In those 6 weeks they get organized, celebrate, get excited, wait for a good omen, and they\u2019re really getting ready, and then the campaigning season starts May 1st. Everybody that knows anything about Europe and the Mediterranean knows that the weather gets good on May 1st! The problem before May 1st? It rains, there\u2019s storms, if you set out to sea or you set out across terrain before that time period, if the cold doesn\u2019t get you, the storm\u2019s gonna get you or your ship\u2019s gonna sink or something! Ultimately, in the history of all of these wars, more people die from natural causes than they die from bullets from the enemy! So the number one danger is: nature\u2019s gonna kill you! So they were all basically doing these summer campaigns. So May 1st they started to campaign. That goes through June, July, August, September \u2014 all good months. If they\u2019re still fighting something, maybe around October they wrap it up. They go into winter quarters by November. November, December, January, maybe they\u2019re having November, but certainly December, January, February \u2014 that\u2019s winter! They\u2019re not doing anything because the elements are a much bigger threat than the enemy is! And if you know anything about the Med, you can\u2019t navigate the Med in the winter! Even in the modern day, no one would want to go yachting in the Med in the winter \u2014 it\u2019s just not comfortable, you get storms, weather is very uncertain! So all this time, they\u2019re rest, they\u2019re recuperating, they\u2019re regrouping, they\u2019re politicking\u2014you can imagine! They\u2019re discussing with each other who\u2019s most suited. That guy\u2019s long in the tooth, that guy\u2019s lost his step, this is the up-and-comer \u2014 you support me, I\u2019ll support you. They\u2019re working through that consensus back in Rome, and they\u2019re remembering what it\u2019s like to be a Roman! And then along comes March, and then they decide who\u2019s gonna do what \u2014 you\u2019re gonna be a tribune, you\u2019re gonna be a consul, you\u2019re gonna be a governor \u2014 let\u2019s put in place an administration. And they\u2019re always rotating and they go and they do it again! And if they send off the best and the brightest and the guy takes an arrow in the back, well next year there\u2019s another guy! Scipio Africanus, one of the most famous Roman generals of all time, he rose to power in his early 20s after all of his uncles and his father died in the Second Punic War. His entire family is getting wiped out, but there\u2019s always another Roman! Always another one! From a very early age! And so the political system had a certain elegance to it because it was tied to the calendar \u2014 it was tied to nature! It was a natural cycle, and it took into account the need of human beings to celebrate each others\u2019 successes. I go campaign, I come back, I get a triumph! It took into account their need to have a common faith. The faith is critical! If we\u2019re not all Romans and we don\u2019t all believe the same things, why are we gonna die for each other? Faith mattered! But the weather mattered! And you know, people don\u2019t realize they did it every year on March 15th, because if I told you the weather\u2019s gonna get good on May 1st and you need an army, when would you start? They\u2019re pretty smart \u2014 700 years of it \u2014 that\u2019s the Roman way! And then they also took into account human motivation, which is: everybody\u2019s got an ego. Everybody needs their turn. Nobody can hog all the power, so even if you were the greatest general this year, you\u2019ve gotta give it up to someone else next year! And as long as they kept turning \u2014 and if I\u2019m the second-most powerful family, you\u2019re from the most powerful family, maybe I\u2019ll support you for consul with the understanding that it\u2019s my turn next year! And then maybe my family will fight and die for you! Because we have a chance at glory next year! But at the point where you take over and you tell me, Well you think you\u2019re gonna keep the job for the next 62 years \u2014 at that point, the fabric of the civilization starts to break down, because that equity and that citizenship and that sense that ,We\u2019re protecting the Roman way of life, starts to degrade to, We\u2019re just protecting someone\u2019s dynasty \u2014 screw them!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: So the dynamism of the hierarchy keeps it revivified and fresh, and they\u2019re harmonized with nature!

And he goes, Well I went to the naval academy and I did this for a few years, and every 1\u20133 years I move to a different command, and I finally made it as an XO, #2 officer, 2 years ago, and I got promoted 6 months ago and I\u2019ll have this command for 24 months or something! And I said, Well let me get this: so there\u2019s only like 12 of you, right? So if you\u2019re 1 of the top-12 most talented officers in the entire navy! Like how many people are in the navy? Hundreds of thousands of people in the military! There\u2019s just 1 of the 12 most important jobs in the US military, bar none! I\u2019m like, So, in like, 12 more months you\u2019re leaving? He said, Yeah, I\u2019m leaving! I\u2019m like, Why wouldn\u2019t they want you to do this job for 20 years? Like, you could start World War III! Why would you take the risk of changing and putting someone else on the job? What if they screw it up, you know? By the way, Robert, we don\u2019t do that in any other part of our economy! We don\u2019t actually put 40-year olds\u2014with term limits of 36 months \u2014 in charge of cities, states, countries, companies. We don\u2019t even put \u2019em in charge of yachts! If you had a 100-foot pleasure craft, you wouldn\u2019t do it. I\u2019d be like, I\u2019d find one captain \u2014 I\u2019m keeping the guy for 20 years! I\u2019m not changing him! You wouldn\u2019t actually do that with a person that cooks your food, or mows your lawn! So, why do you think this guy\u2019s gotta go after 36 months? Any guesses?

We rotate the forest rangers in order to keep anybody from bribing or corrupting the forest rangers so they don\u2019t misuse public national park resources. Brilliant idea, right? A better-off forestry service and a great anti-corruption technique! But that\u2019s not why! I\u2019m standing on the deck of this aircraft carrier talking to this guy whom a lot of people would think like he\u2019s just a junior executive, maybe we\u2019re ready to give him a whatever.

He goes, Well Michael, there\u2019s a lot of really really good people coming out of the academy every year! And everybody needs their turn! Everybody needs their turn. You\u2019re talking about a 21-year old lieutenant coming out of the naval academy saying, These people signed up to commit their life and their career and potentially sacrifice their life to be a navy officer! And at the pinnacle is their hope that they can be the captain and have their own command, and at the pinnacle of that is captain of an aircraft carrier! And if you want people to love and fight and die and cherish your institution, you\u2019ve gotta get out of the way and give \u2019em their chance! Everybody needs their turn!

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: That respect! And that\u2019s what the Romans had in those 700 years \u2014 the height of the republic! It\u2019s, You\u2019re a Roman first! This year, maybe you\u2019re under the command of your family\u2019s #1 adversary, but next year that\u2019ll be your command! And that\u2019s the Roman way! And there\u2019s a certain submission to nature and the organism is greater than any one individual and any one family. It\u2019s continually refreshing itself! We have to have a constant flow of new talent, new leadership. Someone drops the baton, someone else picks up the baton! That\u2019s what made the Romans great! They suffered no kings among them! You look at the Second Punic War and then maybe it was the Second Macedonian War? Eventually the Romans went to fight against Philip of Macedon. He was a king! And he had an awful son, and his one son got fighting with his other son, and convinced the father to murder the second son, and then the father realized that he\u2019d made a mistake because his first son lied to him! And the father was a nutcase crazy guy, and the son was kind of crazy, and it corrupted the entire society, and the Roman consul was just the most talented general and he knew that \u2014 the way it worked was, his officers were from every other competing family in Rome! If that general was lazy, drunk, cowardly, or stupid, it got reported back by the officer corps to Rome and to the Senate! And so they were slightly gossipy, but the point is, when you know that everybody\u2019s watching you and that you can be replaced and will be replaced next year and your future is uncertain, it brings out a higher degree of professionalism, and that\u2019s the competition in the market! You\u2019re a miner, and they cut off your electricity, well your mining rig stops and the mining shifts somewhere else!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:22:32]: Absolutely!

So I think it\u2019s really interesting!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:22:53]: So the Roman political system, it bred harder, stronger, faster, smarter individuals! No apologies about it, from age 3, this is the way it is! And Rome comes first, and everybody else\u2019s interests are subjugated! And when you look at that, they started with that system \u2014 a good system! \u2014 I mean people forget about it! 700 years as a republic! Find me another republic that lasted 700 years [inaudible]. Then you\u2019ve got the Roman army, and that tells a different story. The Roman army takes us back to this issue of, There was never such thing as a fair fight. The Romans weren\u2019t fighting fair! They would\u2019ve laughed at you! The Roman approach to this was to take my illustration of the slinger on the cliff and take it to a whole new level! The Romans manufactured ballistas, catapults, every sword and shield to be the same length, every soldier took the same step the same length, everything was the same! You could be an 8-foot tall goliath, and the Roman 5' 10\" tall normal dude is gonna beat the crap out of you because you\u2019re not gonna get within 12 feet of him because you\u2019re gonna take a spear in the gut from the 12 guys standing to his left and his right as you charge! In all of these time periods, all of these wars, and you read Livy and he describes them very in depth, over and over again: hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of battles, and they always consisted of the Romans maneuvered to get the high ground, the Romans maneuvered to get the enemy out on the plain, the Romans unleashed the artillery onto the enemy while they stood and obliterated 10% of them. Then the Romans unleashed some more artillery! There\u2019s one story where the Roman army cornered the Gauls. The Gauls are on a mountaintop, on a hillside, and the Romans are below \u2014 they just surround them, they stop, they start to pummel them, and they rain down hell from above \u2014 bullets, boulders, napalm, and Livy writes, Before a Roman even took a step toward the enemy line, half of the Gauls were dead and 80% of them had been maimed or incapacitated from the bullets. And then the Romans start to move up and do something! It\u2019s like, there\u2019s none of this, Let\u2019s just charge into battle and fight it out with our sword, right? Never happened that way! It was always going to be: find a way to get an advantage. And by the way, the technology is very critical! The Romans had a military industrial complex. There\u2019s a way to do it, you\u2019re gonna do it in a certain way. They had an entire body language, and entire system of how you\u2019re going to act. If you want something which is eye-opening, there\u2019s this story of the Roman navy from the First Punic War. The Carthaginians dominate the Mediterranean, the Romans are a land power. The Romans don\u2019t know anything about naval power \u2014 but it tells you a lot about the Roman psyche and intellect. The Romans are getting beat up by the Carthaginians because the Carthaginians control the ports and they have the fleet. The Romans have no fleet! One day, a storm kicks up, and the storm drives a Carthaginian naval ship into a Roman port \u2014 it\u2019s blown into the port by a bad mistral. The Romans capture it! They take it apart to try to figure out how the Carthaginians make their ships. You can\u2019t make this up! This is the most amazing thing in history! They find out that the Carthaginians make their ships from a kit from reusable standardized parts, and not only are all the parts standardized, the Carthaginians have labeled each part with the instructions with where it fits and the number of the part. The Romans deconstruct the entire thing, steal the entire blueprint. 9 days later they made 150 ships! You think these guys were screwing around? They\u2019re not screwing around! It\u2019s like, everything\u2019s, Oh you know, I\u2019m gonna take my time to figure this stuff out. No! War has a way! War has a way of quickening your activity! Bam! I\u2019m losing? I find a ship, that\u2019s the DNA, that\u2019s the formula of the ship \u2014 150 ships. To make a long story short, the Romans win the First Punic War and they vanquish the Carthaginians and they become the naval power! Of course, it\u2019s not that the Romans invented everything, it\u2019s just that the Romans stole every good idea from every civilization from the Greeks, from the Carthaginians, from the whatever that they crushed! And because they lasted, we\u2019re able to read their histories! It kind of blows your minds that in 500 years \u2014 by the way, you think the Carthaginians invented that? Maybe they stole it from the Phoenicians! 500 B.C., if you want to win wars, you don\u2019t just make ships. And you don\u2019t just train hard. And you don\u2019t just make wagons, right? Roman roads. The Romans had standardized parts, a standardized gauge for a wagon wheel \u2014 every Roman wagon rolling on the road is carving ruts in the road. That gauge has to be standardized, you can\u2019t just make any wagon, you have to make it exactly the same! For all those people that recoil at standardization, well that Roman wagon gauge eventually became the standard width of a railroad track in Europe. And then the standard width of a railroad track everywhere! So if you want to know how wide a Roman chariot was, or a war chariot or any chariot, just go stand on a railroad anywhere on Earth \u2014 the Roman\u2019s gave that to you! And the reason why they did it that way is because, if you build wagons with different gauges, they fall in the rut, they snap the axle, and that\u2019s death! So it\u2019s like, Henry Ford said, You can have it any color as long as it\u2019s black! No! You can\u2019t have it any way you want it! It\u2019s not that every civilization figured this out. It\u2019s just that every civilization which insisted upon doing it a different way with different bells and whistles got crushed to death! There\u2019s an analogy with this in the Bitcoin world too! When you come up with a different feature it\u2019s like, It would just be 10% better, you know, if you made your wagon 10% wider: it would hold 20% more and you would need 10% less and your transaction costs would be less!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:31:21]: It points towards path dependence too. The fact that a technology already took a certain path, it kind of has an inertia that\u2019s carried the width of the gauge of the wagon wheel to the width of the modern rail! I thought it was interesting too you pointed to the civilizations that won out, the Romans over the Carthaginians, are the ones that studied their history! So they\u2019re actually gleaning insights from civilizations that had come before them, which again hearkens back to that Yuval Harari concept of our ability to abstract our learnings into symbols like language or whatnot, and then pass them from generation to generation such that the most successful strategies take advantage of the collective learnings up until that point! Versus trying to just do something from scratch on your own. Like we all stand on the shoulders of giants, so to speak."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:32:16]: Yeah those roads were the logistics network of the Roman empire, and if you can move goods and services, if you can move armies faster inside your borders than your enemies can move inside their borders, then you\u2019re gonna win! Well you\u2019ve got a major major advantage! If everybody lays down a railroad track that\u2019s a certain width and you come up with an idea for a car that\u2019s got a different width \u2014 who are you gonna sell it to? People talk about protocols being important, right? Well TCP/IP wasn\u2019t the first protocol! Roman roads probably weren\u2019t the first protocol either, but the point is, protocols matter, and it\u2019s arrogant \u2014 by the way, I\u2019m sure that the Egyptians had protocols to build those pyramids! Standard sizes, widths, weights and measures. Those protocols matter a heck of a lot! And if you don\u2019t have them, it\u2019s impossible for people to cooperate! So we\u2019ve talked about money a lot as being essential for civilization to cooperate and allowing us to specialize, but all these other logistics protocols or military protocols are in their own way equally important! I\u2019ll make one last point on Roman engineering on aqueducts. The Romans understood the importance of hydraulics, and they took it to a new level. They actually created aqueducts that would bring water from up to 70 miles away to a given city. There are a lot of coastal cities on the Med that are uninhabitable \u2014 the natural economic density is really a function of the amount of water per year, so if the amount of water per year is based on rainwater, maybe you can have 500 people live in the city. And if you bring the aqueduct it goes to 5,000 or 50,000. And so the economic density requires the hydraulic flow for sanitation and just to keep everybody alive! So engineering the roads, the aqueducts, it\u2019s the rails upon which the entire Iron Age civilization was built! And Romans \u2014 if anything \u2014 they\u2019re engineers! And they elevated engineering, above all! What is engineering? I am an engineer. I think engineering is an incredible honorable, ethical life-affirming profession. The basic credo of the engineer is, I look at nature, and I look at the circumstances that I\u2019m surrounded by, and I use my intellect and every material and technique at hand in order to construct a better world for everyone and everything that I love! That\u2019s the credo! I\u2019m not going to be a victim of circumstance! I\u2019m going to actually change my circumstances with my intellect and that might mean build a bridge. It might mean build an aqueduct, build a road, build a ship \u2014 whatever it is, just like the beaver builds the dam, the engineer builds the world! Look at any city where you take the bridge down, and try to figure out how life changes! And it\u2019s pretty consequential! I\u2019ll leave you one more vignette on Rome and then we\u2019ll move on I think to the Dark Ages. I have a holding company, it\u2019s called Alcantara. And Alcantara is based upon something I saw in Alcantara, Spain. It\u2019s a Roman bridge \u2014 it stood for 2,000 years! And if you go underneath that bridge you\u2019ll find a Roman inscription in Latin, where the Roman Engineer whose name is Julius Locker said, This bridge will stand for all time. They took their engineering seriously!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:37:09]: I recall from Taleb\u2019s writing that the architects of the Roman aqueducts \u2014 to give the architects skin in the game, so to speak \u2014 he would be required himself or even with his family at times, to stand beneath the aqueduct as the scaffolding was removed. So he knew it was his life and possibly his family\u2019s life on the line, should his architectural abilities be incompetent! Again it\u2019s a protocol! It\u2019s a protocol and an incentive or a disincentive to malperformance for that architect, to take his profession very seriously! Another thing that came to mind, Rome as being incipient too all these civilizational technologies and protocols we use \u2014 what ultimately led to their downfall was their monetary protocol being compromised! It was the debasement of the coin, I think it started with Nero, and eventually led to the forking into the East Roman empire \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [1:38:20]: And their political protocols compromised! A series of civil wars \u2014 Caesar\u2019s being the most famous, but a series of civil wars where the political protocols broke down, even before the monetary protocols broke down. You can see they\u2019re all related and at some point the integrity of the society broke down, and when they lost their integrity across all of these areas, the collapse of the political system begat the collapse of the military system. The religion \u2014 how do you maintain your patriotism in Rome when one Roman army is fighting another Roman army?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: Right!

Taleb I think makes great points in his books about how it\u2019s the death penalty in Babylon if you screwed with weights and measures! Or if you\u2019re a builder and your house collapses, your own family dies. There are definitely skin in the game points, and they just remind you that in a society that respects natural law, nature is not going to pity you and she\u2019s not listening for excuses! I know this is not quite relevant but I can\u2019t help but state it: The richest man in China a year or two years ago was out on summer vacation in the South of France. The guy\u2019s worth $20\u2013$30 Billion. And he decided to take a selfie or get a photo, and he stood up on a rock wall at some ancient ruin in the South of France, and while they were taking the photo, he slipped and fell off the side of the wall and plunged 50 feet to his death! Again, somewhat emblematic of the point \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter if you have an army of lawyers and $1 Billion of clout \u2014 in that last 2 seconds of his life, he was punished by violating the law of gravity with a death sentence! You know, gravity doesn\u2019t care who you are! Nature doesn\u2019t care! The richest man in China, out of a billion people, and he was sentenced to immediate death \u2014 no appeal, in a split second, for being careless! And when society forms all of these appeals and excuses and they let everybody off the hook, it\u2019s like, Well, if you make a market in accepting excuses and lawsuits, you\u2019re gonna get a lot of lawsuits and a lot of excuses!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:42:05]: And then Too Big to Fail institutions were interrupting the evolutionary impulse!

Where did your understanding of a lot of these topics like Austrian economics come from?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [05:24]: Well I started studying Austrian economics in high school after the financial crisis happened. And I realized that I knew nothing about economics. I was hearing on the radio people talking about all these different things going on and, despite being a high-performing student in some respects, despite being kind of a smart guy or whatever, I had no clue what they were talking about! And that was quite humbling! So because of that I reached out to some people online to get some information on economics, and I was sent \u2014 thankfully \u2014 basically Rothbard and other ways to the Mises Institute. So I was devouring that all through high school and college, and I think that gave me a very strong if not somewhat heterodox view of money as far as the modern age goes! But that also set me right up for being able to incorporate Bitcoin into my worldview!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I find this interesting in the sense that \u2014 obviously that event is definitely gonna draw attention to the mindhive \u2014 and so I can completely understand you diving into it a bit.

I\u2019ve learned a lot about economics here, but I\u2019m still probably gonna get a four-year degree, maybe a job somewhere. I mean not everyone takes that information and thinks it\u2019s gonna enhance their life in any way that might impact their actions or their behavior down the road. And sometimes you say, Okay well you might study economics and you might find out that maybe you think a certain system is not designed properly or is gamed \u2014 but what is the individual gonna do about it? And what are you gonna do with this knowledge?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah! It\u2019s a very good question but I guess it\u2019s funny because for me it was like, Well, when it really comes down to it I wanted to win arguments online! That was what it brought me, was the ability to win arguments online. It does also paint a generally coherent view of the world, and having that I think is just generally powerful to have because you\u2019re able to make rational decisions about what to do! It sets the stage so you can apply it to just about any part of your life. So especially with Austrian economics with its specific ways of looking at things like entrepreneurship, it sets you up for thinking about entrepreneurship in a very broad way, encourages entrepreneurship, encourages capital accumulation and all that. With that, whatever it is someone has an interest in beyond just the economics, it can help you in your decision making \u2014 it sets up a good picture of the world to place yourself in.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I wonder how much of it was from \u2014 I think you\u2019ve called yourself a lifelong contrarian?

{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: You know, this is so long ago now I don\u2019t really remember what kind of online discussions I was getting into or if it was just me lurking the Internet on those topics! It\u2019s been too long for me to remember! It could have been one or the other, but as far as finding that, the very first thing that I read of a sort of Libertarian and economic \u2014 in that realm \u2014 was an essay called I, Pencil by Leonard Read, which is a famous one. I think most people would know it based on the Milton Freedman retelling in Free to Choose.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: That\u2019s what I\u2019ve seen, or at least a video of it."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah it\u2019s just describing how when you actually come down to it, no one person knows how to create a pencil! It seems absurd but it\u2019s true because you have to get the wood from somewhere, and that requires all of this specialized knowledge of cutting down the wood, etc., then you have the people who have to go get the graphite, the little metal piece, the eraser, you have the rubber of the eraser \u2014 you have all of these lines of production that go into this single thing! And so there is a factory where probably one guy knows how to take all of those resources and put them together, but that ignores all of the structures of production that lead up to that point! So what that essay taught me \u2014 I mean before I was even done with the essay it just all clicked \u2014 what a market really is, it\u2019s a very expansive set of these structures of production and exchange between different producers and consumers and all of that. Also, because of how complex it is, you probably don\u2019t want to mess with it! So it was very easy with those simple realizations to get sucked into the anarcho-capitalist mindset of Rothbard. From there, I\u2019ve certainly tried to challenge that worldview a lot, but for the most part it\u2019s just been sharpening over time! Adding nuance where needed, but mostly just diving into the implications of this and how we can apply it perhaps to our understanding of the historical events and the world around us.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [14:55]: So you get to University of Texas, and do you start the Mises Circle right away? Is that something you just start up? And what kind of reaction did you get in the Mises Circle? I ask in the sense that, I think you also mentioned that the Longhorn Libertarians were the best Libertarian group in the country, and it seemed like this was a really special crucible! Or did you just make things happen there?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [15:24]: No there was already a group there, the Libertarian Longhorns, that at the time it was all a bunch of hardcore Rothbardians on UT campus! I was actually sad that I wasn\u2019t able to get in touch with them while I was still in high school, because it\u2019d be nice to have that camaraderie. They were already like that, so I fit right in! And it was a wonderful group of people and that\u2019s where I met many friends who I know to this day! Yeah the Mises Circle was started later on because when you\u2019re in these groups there is this kind of understandable pattern where you stick with a lot of basics, because you always have new people coming in to check out the group, so you want to keep it accessible to a wide audience. For instance, when the topic of economics comes up, you\u2019ll find that a lot of groups like this, it\u2019s talking about the broken window fallacy over and over and over again. It\u2019s like, That\u2019s a good lesson! It\u2019s great! Every new person needs to learn that lesson! There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s the very first thing in Henry Hazlitt\u2019s Economics in One Lesson. However, as someone who already knows that lesson and has a deeper interest in the economics, there was a desire to be able to dive in deeper with friends. So a few of us just made an additional group that could act as a reading group and dive into whatever was interesting us at the time! There was a gazillion different rabbit holes you can go down within economics!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [17:18]: Sure! It sounds like the group is a little bigger than I imagined in the Libertarian group, and then you guys moved into the Mises Circle to get a more intimate experience, dive deeper into certain subjects?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: It was just like an offshoot, yeah.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Right. And did the Mises Circle become the Nakamoto Circle at some point?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: And later on you start to see that there was a lot of Bitcoin-related discussion, and that came about in late 2012 and early 2013. As soon as you get into Bitcoin, it\u2019s hard to stop thinking about it! So in a way it did become the Bitcoin circle! The Nakamoto Institute idea did kind of stem out of that, but basically the Mises Circle was where these ideas were first being developed. We were the ones \u2014 sorry I shouldn\u2019t say the ones, there were other places that were thinking about Austrian economics! \u2014 but it was a place where we were trying to take this thing, Bitcoin, that we had all gotten interested in, and try to apply an Austrian lens to it, to understand it through Austrian analysis! At the time online, there was just not that much to go by to think about Bitcoin from a serious economic perspective. So I was like, Okay, well, we\u2019ll just have to figure this out! The good news is that the Austrians pretty much had money completely figured out! So it was really just about porting over what already existed onto Bitcoin. But that does have its hurdles that I think a lot of people have recognized: that not all Austrians have been able to make those leaps!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [19:38]: Yeah that\u2019s the hinge that I really want to dive into here! So in high school you come across Austrian economics, which is not a brand new science. It\u2019s been around since the mid-1800s I believe. But you come across it, you\u2019re not learning about it in school, you dive into it! I don\u2019t know how you come across Bitcoin between 2008\u20132012 but you do, and I see the Nakamoto Institute as a natural extension of the Mises Circle and discussion, but, like you\u2019re touching on, there is that hinge where you\u2019re reframing the conversation, and I find it remarkable that your mind was able to not switch the conversation but switch the framing very quickly upon this new idea! And what I\u2019m impressed by is your ability to digest a new idea to you, and decide what it means to you! So I just think that\u2019s remarkable and I wonder \u2014 for Bitcoiners today a lot of Bitcoiners today they might discover it on Twitter and it still is a very solo experience! And I gotta imagine it\u2019s quite different to be able to have these incubated conversations very early on, and very interesting and very special to maintain these relationships over this long period of time and still be interested in the same thing! Sort of like, I\u2019m amazed when four guys end up in the high school and form Radiohead, and they just happened to meet as children and they\u2019re able to create music together, but also maintain those relationships! Because people change, and your views change, and maybe Bitcoin is this one fundamental thing that doesn\u2019t change. But I find it remarkable! Maybe you could just touch on: Has it been a different ride for you? Having that experience \u2014 you know in college I used to stay up with friends and we used to talk about things all night! Maybe all weekend! And you can get into things in philosophy and metaphysical topics and esoteric things. I have less time with my friends to do that \u2014I\u2019m not saying I have less time now. And then to maintain that dialogue I just think is remarkable!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [21:56]: Yeah! I think I was very lucky to be with a group of people who had a similar worldview because having a sort of hardcore Rothbardian outlook on the world is not something you come across often! So the fact that there was a good group of people that I could be chatting with all of the time on these things \u2014 I was very very fortunate! I agree these sustained dialogues, they\u2019re just amazing to have! I think everyone could benefit from being able to find even just one person that they can maintain a dialogue with over the course of years. To this point, people see how Pierre and I are \u2014 we have a podcast together, we did the Nakamoto Institute and all of that, you know? We met at the University of Texas while doing this and it\u2019s been able to maintain that the whole time! So yeah I was very fortunate to be able to have those particular things come together.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [23:12]: Yeah well it makes me think that UT is a very special place!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: At least our part of it! I don\u2019t know what the rest of the school was like!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I understand! But the fact that it was there, and I believe UT is in Austin and you\u2019re still in Austin, so I\u2019m assuming that there\u2019s more to it than just the campus! I mean you moved there from a different part of Texas and it seems like you\u2019re still there!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Texas is home! So it\u2019s just what it is!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah. We\u2019ll touch on that hopefully a little later! I do want to turn our attention to the first piece I want to dive into. You did write this in September of 2014, I think that\u2019s important to note. And it\u2019s Everyone\u2019s a Scammer! The first thing we\u2019re gonna touch on is there was a war going on! What do you mean by that? Especially in 2014?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [24:03]: Yeah! It\u2019s funny, over the years people have always been very upset about throwing around the word scammer, which I made sure to put my disclaimer all the way at the end because they\u2019re not gonna read the whole article!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I was gonna touch it! It\u2019s a heuristic, we\u2019ll get there!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah it\u2019s a heuristic rather than an accusation. Now there are actual scammers \u2014 I think everyone would agree, including shitcoiners, that there are many for real actual scammers in this space! But the real thing is just, this article was me trying to take the scarcity of Bitcoin completely seriously! And take these implications to the logical conclusions and think about, Well what is the implication of that in how I should view other people in the space? To me that\u2019s like, If everyone\u2019s a scammer, that doesn\u2019t mean to have a negative view of everyone! But it\u2019s more about being able to cultivate the lowest time preference attitude possible! Because if your default is that everyone is just trying to take your Bitcoins, then it sets a high threshold for what you\u2019re willing to actually give, which means that you are cultivating serious standards for yourself! And all of this is just very important because there are only 21 million Bitcoins and as we\u2019ve seen the price since that article has continued to increase at an exponential rate, and you just have to take that seriously! There\u2019s no going back, and I wish there was going back, because I was a college kid up until around when that article was written! It\u2019s like, I couldn\u2019t even afford Bitcoin when they were super cheap because I was completely broke! So I wish I could go back and be buying $10 Bitcoin! So you have to have that forward-thinking attitude, but not just to tomorrow but deep into the future! So when a person is offering to sell stuff for Bitcoin it\u2019s like, Well what\u2019s in it for you to pay in Bitcoins? Now if there wasn\u2019t a capital gains tax on just any Bitcoin spending, then there could be a reason to want to spend and replace because it\u2019s just like, there are obvious benefits to being able to spend in Bitcoin rather than using a credit card. However as far as pure economics, a lot of people talked about spending Bitcoins as if it\u2019s this sort of great, altruistic thing that grows the network or whatever! No, what grows the network is its scarcity and Number Go Up, not dis-HODLing! And so you\u2019re not really helping, especially if a lot of these merchants are just gonna be turning around and selling the Bitcoin themselves, they\u2019re just suppressing the price \u2014 that\u2019s all you\u2019ve done! Whereas if you HODL it, you\u2019re helping add \u2014 you\u2019re helping the value increase, thus on the very margins you\u2019re benefiting from Bitcoin\u2019s growth!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [27:59]: Right. I mean for me, I think the root of this article is praxeology. I didn\u2019t know that word at the time I read this article. It\u2019s funny you say you\u2019re gonna get people upset \u2014 you\u2019re calling everyone a scammer! So you read that title and I\u2019m like, Alright bro! Let\u2019s go! Like, how am I a scammer? I\u2019m reading through it and I\u2019m thinking, Yes, yes, well he\u2019s gotta call me a scammer somehow, how is he gonna include me? How is he gonna upset me? And then I think the really interesting part is that you did call me a scammer. You said: Hoarders are scammers! They want your Bitcoin! I said, Holy fuckin\u2019 shit! I\u2019m a scammer! He just got me in here! And I\u2019m not mad at him! And I think the reason that \u2014 what clicked for me is that it goes to something that Breedlove just said on my show recently or on Twitter I think, but it was like, Bitcoin kind of unlocks the selfishness to selflessness. So it\u2019s encouraging selfishness to get to a more selfless place for the entire community. But you gotta recognize your self-interest first! That\u2019s what I got through it: I\u2019m a hoarder! I\u2019m a scammer! I want your Bitcoins! I want them for less than you think they\u2019re worth right now!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [29:14]: Yeah! Before the show you were talking about growing up Jewish, I forget what Jewish thinker or whatever but I remember I was hearing something about, You can\u2019t help others if you don\u2019t help yourself, kind of thing. So that\u2019s a bit of wisdom that people walk around with and can often forget about it when they demand that other people just be altruistic for no other reason than someone wants some free stuff. But yeah that\u2019s a common viewpoint of how free market capitalism, not corporatist capitalism or whatever the heck you would even want to call this hellhole that we have. Because Mises writes about the sovereign consumer. Where ultimately a producer on the free market \u2014 he has to be selling to someone, and the person buying things is the person who gets to decide what makes or breaks that producer! They are the real sovereign! You can put a product out on the market, but that doesn\u2019t mean that anyone is going to buy it! So if you cannot create something that people are willing to buy, then you\u2019re shit out of luck! So in a free market capitalist system, you have to think about other people\u2019s wants and needs in order to even satisfy your greediness! Which I think is a very good thing for a society, because you do have to basically be empathetic of others and think about others\u2019 needs! And then if you do well at satisfying those peoples\u2019 needs, you get handsomely rewarded, so in a sense what Breedlove was saying, that sort of selflessness is kind of rewarded. So the only way to be very successfully selfish is to be selfless in one sense of the term.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [31:49]: The other thing that I want to bring up that you note in this article \u2014 again it\u2019s really important to note when you wrote this article, in 2014 \u2014 you say, All investments are scams! And I\u2019m reading this article probably in 2019, maybe 2018? And so now there\u2019s five years where I can look at data points, and see how right you are in the article! And then you bring up under the topic of Investments are scams \u2014 and this blew me away when I was revisiting this the other day \u2014 you talk about, Investments are scams because they\u2019ll lead you to believe that you can get a higher return than holding the Bitcoin itself! Despite the economics of Bitcoin naturally making this an absurd claim in the medium-run, in a post-fiat world there\u2019ll be plenty of investments that have a greater return and risk than holding Bitcoin, but they\u2019ll be assets that generate Bitcoin cash flows. I think that\u2019s astounding, talking about Bitcoin cash flows in 2014! You know, we look at this in 2021, and the writing\u2019s on the wall: you can look at something like MicroStrategy and what they\u2019ve done with their treasury, and you could just look at the data points of the price of Bitcoin compared to anything else in the market! And that\u2019s what gave me\u2014when I\u2019m revisiting your work and I\u2019m enjoying the humor and the wit and the cleverness, is also the truth in it! The facts and the data points."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Well at least with Ethereum 2.0. There is at least a running network and I have to at least give them credit for starting the network. Based on some metrics, some people have done better against Bitcoin at different scales. But even now, a lot of the people who got interested in Ethereum say in the giant bubbles in 2017 and stuff \u2014 they\u2019re doing very poorly. Once again this goes back towards needing to have a very long term view of Bitcoin, and be very cognizant of those exponential trends!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [34:22]: I took the article in a different way! Because I think you do mention Ethereum, not so much as a success, but you note the fact that they sold the Ethereum for Bitcoin! That to me was a huge wrinkle in the shitcoin paradigm."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Right I think the Ethereum Foundation held Bitcoin, yeah.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: They all sold it for Bitcoin! They didn\u2019t sell for dollars, for stocks and bonds, or for yen! They took Bitcoin, and that was the key! If you zoom out far enough, I will argue that the Ethereum holders will lose in Bitcoin terms and they lost their Bitcoin to the scammer who took their Bitcoin!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [35:10]: Right. Okay, I\u2019m looking at the article again! And I\u2019m remembering now, yeah. Because the original thing \u2014 there was like the Exodus address that everyone was sending to for the crowd sale!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: So now we kind of talked about Everyone\u2019s a Scammer, and we know that it\u2019s a heuristic and not an accusation. But we\u2019ve learned about praxeology here. You had a conversation with Peter McCormack, that was also one of my favorite pods of all time! And the name of that conversation Rejecting All Forms of Activism, and that was actually maybe ten minutes out of the hour and a half \u2014 and I think the whole hour and a half is astounding \u2014 and people should check that show out on its own. But the idea of Rejecting All Forms of Activism, again this was a pivotal in my worldview when I was listening to this conversation. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen the movie Fallen Down?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [37:28]: Yeah I mean I think it\u2019s great to try to influence others, but it\u2019s important to understand where are you actually doing the influence! So I think that the real key there is it\u2019s trying to think through a lot of the actual economic opportunity costs of these different activities. There are a lot of things that I think everyone wants to change in the world. There\u2019s certainly things I want to change in the world, it\u2019s why I\u2019ve been interested in Bitcoin and other related topics! But a lot of people have been trained to think that, for instance, going to the voting booth every four years or whatever is the highest calling as far as actually doing something to change the world. Now, do some elections matter? Probably, there\u2019s probably like different local elections that people could get involved in, where they can actually have a real impact. I wouldn\u2019t discount that! But as far as like, voting for a president, for one, I still don\u2019t even know if the president is actually even a powerful entity or if it\u2019s just an entertainment show in front of other power structures!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I\u2019m gonna go with the latter!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [39:05]: So if that\u2019s the game, it\u2019s like, What are you even voting for? It seems even less relevant than voting for American Idol because at least that has like \u2014 it seems more real!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: You could maybe get what you want!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah! So there\u2019s that but it\u2019s also the sheer number of people in your voting blocs, you just don\u2019t have an appreciable statistical effect! So if that\u2019s the case, then why expend so much energy on that one act, as opposed to other things that you can do in your life? People look towards that activity as a way to address a lot of big problems in life, so like, You name the area of their life and someone will tell you how voting for the right person is going to fix everything, or get us put on the right track! Meanwhile, I think there\u2019s just laziness in, at the very least, assuming that elections are the be all, end all. So externalize all of that responsibility onto just some ballot thing you throw out. Because I think about the world around us: there\u2019s a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities, there\u2019s a lot of places that you as an individual can make actual impacts in your community, in your family, and none of that involves having to go convince a bunch of people to fill in a bubble the same way you do! But, it does involve having to do actual hard work, and I think that\u2019s perhaps something that people are not interested in doing, and certainly it is hard work! But in order to get anything done in this world, you do have to put in the work! So I find it unfortunate that people hinge so much of their life on politics, without thinking about these other opportunities they can take to improve their station in life, especially when those other opportunities not only will have an effect, but probably could have an even bigger effect than those elections themselves! So I think Bitcoin is just the best example of this, because the Federal Reserve has been a problem since the day it began. It was created because banks wanted to control the money supply further so that they could manage our lives more than they could manage it prior to the Federal Reserve. And it\u2019s devalued our money since then in a dramatic way, it\u2019s had all of the effects on the economy that we could have whole podcasts on. So it hasn\u2019t been fixed, it was never fixed \u2014 for the most part people weren\u2019t even talking about it! It wasn\u2019t even that much of a topic at all until Ron Paul and especially in his presidential runs, where he opened people\u2019s eyes to this! But even then Ron Paul was merely educating \u2014 now, I say merely and yet, I think most of the people who hate the Fed, that kind of stems from Ron Paul \u2014 so, many thanks to the good doctor for spreading the word and getting us to believe that. Even so, as far as political action \u2014 to actually do something about it \u2014 that\u2019s been at a complete standstill and obviously we\u2019ve sort of regressed in the sense that the monetary supply continues to increase, there are no checks on the system, we\u2019re seeing what\u2019s happening this week with Gamestop and it\u2019s revealing a lot of absolutely insane inequalities in the way the monetary and financial system is set up and effectively rigged. So it just doesn\u2019t go anywhere! We make no progress no matter how much we might stamp our feet with regards to the fact that the Fed exists and hasn\u2019t been audited. But Bitcoin comes along and it comes at it in a completely orthogonal way that\u2019s also completely productive, it\u2019s just like, Okay! We\u2019ll just make our own! And we just do that! I don\u2019t even have to consider the idea of calling a Congressman to say, Hey! Can you uh, think about ending the Fed? I don\u2019t have to do that at all! I can just go stack sats! And every sat you stack is at the margins pushing us towards hyperbitcoinization! Now, maybe not to a large extent, but they all add up! Every sat that\u2019s going into deep cold storage is pushing us closer to a fully Bitcoinized economy. So because of that, the actual expenditure of energy is going towards a much more fulfilling place. We\u2019re actually getting something for the effort that we put in now! So before, I was a Libertarian pre-Bitcoin, I\u2019d stamp my feet, I was like, Oh! How bad is it that we live in this world that has the Fed! I don\u2019t have that negativity anymore! I don\u2019t care! In fact I feel bad for all of the Americans who are harmed by it, but I actually kind of relish the Federal Reserve taking absurd action, because it\u2019s like, You\u2019re just digging your own grave! So we can actually be somewhat accelerationist on that now! It\u2019s like, Yeah! That\u2019s fine! We have our own thing now!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [45:33]: Yeah! There was a lot there that I agree with and that I want to touch on. One thing was the cost-benefit of voting. You were the one who really struck a chord with me. I actually thought this last year, for the right not to vote! To use that time to do other things! I wasn\u2019t doing a podcast then but that was the argument, it was like, Well I could go do a podcast, and that will be evergreen and in perpetuity creating value for us, whether it\u2019s from what I learn from there or whether other people learn from there or whether it takes off, but I\u2019m doing something for us, for our life, versus taking time out of my day to try to solve a problem or \u2014 I agree with you, I don\u2019t think I have any impact \u2014 that was the cost-benefit analysis! I\u2019m like, My vote doesn\u2019t matter! There are other things I could do that matter! I could spend that time with my family, my friends. There was this conversation around, The most important election of our lifetimes, I would argue that \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Every single election is the most important!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Right! And I would argue that they get less important each time! In terms of them being figureheads and not really the seat of power. But one thing I want to touch on is Ron Paul. Not his presidential bid, but my question is: I\u2019m not very familiar with Ron Paul. And when Ron Paul ran for president, I saw it in the same way \u2014 I was in New York, I wasn\u2019t familiar with this senator, and I wasn\u2019t listening or hearing the arguments per se, so I just knew that there was a flank senator running from one of the lower states of the union. And it wasn\u2019t anything more to me than a flank \u2014 an Andrew Yang running, or anybody else, right? And I think Andrew Yang\u2019s a bad example here, I\u2019m not discussing him here either, but I think he\u2019s been more well received than Ron Paul was by the greater masses! I\u2019m not saying I receive him well or not, I think more people received Andrew Yang better. And what I\u2019m getting at is, Ron Paul was not received well in the north, or in New York, or in my circles. And that precluded me from doing my own research. So I\u2019m curious \u2014 and I\u2019ve heard you speak very highly of Ron Paul \u2014 so my question is, Where did he come from, and what did he mean to you \u2014 and I\u2019m not talking about presidential run \u2014 I\u2019m talking about him [rising] up and speaking to the Fed?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [48:05]: Well it\u2019s interesting because when Ron Paul ran in 2008, that was when most people caught wind of him, even though he had been in the House of Representatives for many many years before that doing great things. People should actually go back and read some of his statements in Congress. He has amazing stuff! I think relevant to Bitcoiners, for instance \u2014 they would probably love reading what he had to say about KYC regulations and stuff like that! When that was going on I was not that familiar with him. I knew one or two people that were into him, but there was in particular a moment in one of the debates \u2014 I don\u2019t think I was even watching the debate live but I think I saw a clip later on \u2014 one that I think had a big effect on many people, which was him standing up to Rudy Giuliani with regards to Osama bin Laden and the War on Terror, and Ron Paul pointing out that, You know, they attacked us for a reason, and they stated that reason! Now that doesn\u2019t mean that that was a good reason, but we can go and see what was the grievance that they felt that caused this to happen in the first place, and in what ways can that cause a need for self-reflection? And in this case it\u2019s like, Well we\u2019ve been meddling around in the Middle-East for so long, it has created a lot of aggression towards the American foreign policy machine and the war machine that has been basically oppressing those people! And of course they\u2019re gonna be mad about that! So it was a great moment \u2014 people should go watch that! In hindsight really what that did \u2014 that didn\u2019t make me a Ron Paul fanboy, it just made me [think], Oh! He\u2019s like a cool Republican! And he was on my radar like, Okay, this is a guy that\u2019s cool. He gets it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [50:30]: Do you think it\u2019s all altruistic with him? And I\u2019m just asking out of carte blanche."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah. He\u2019s very much an educator through and through. I think his whole life is one of service to the community. His work as an OBGYN delivering babies and all of the stories around that \u2014 he\u2019s delivered thousands of babies in the Lake Jackson area, including people in need. And his time in politics was also like a means to be able to educate people about these topics that you don\u2019t hear about! No one talks about the Fed! Going forward though I was all on Mises.org and reading all about Austrian economics, and I kept seeing the name Ron Paul! Which was very surprising, because he was just like that random old guy that was pretty cool in the election! And I soon found out that all of this Austrian economics stuff I was getting into, he was all into that! That was the whole basis of his entire political platform! In hindsight it was like, Oh! That\u2019s why he was so cool! Because he was spouting this stuff that I\u2019m learning right now! And so I came to respect him because I found out he had been a major proponent of the ideas that I was very much getting into. And by the time the 2012 election was happening, if he had become president, how cool would that have been? But, it was more a time for me to use Ron Paul\u2019s bid as an education opportunity, to be like, Hey! There\u2019s this candidate \u2014 what are the ideas he\u2019s talking about? They\u2019re very important! Let\u2019s learn about Austrian economics and anarcho-capitalism! I didn\u2019t care so much about the actual politics of it, if that makes sense.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [52:34]: Yeah that makes a lot of sense to me especially coming from you! I\u2019m trying to frame up, so 2008 the great financial crisis was obviously a huge inflection point in your life \u2014 that\u2019s what kind of brought you to Austrian economics, Austrian economics I don\u2019t want to say brings you to Bitcoin but takes you in a new direction. And I don\u2019t want to speak for you but it seems like that\u2019s a really big inflection point in your life, and I\u2019m gonna make up numbers here that are off by a couple years just to round things out, but if you\u2019re 21 when the great financial crisis happens, you were 10 when there\u2019s the 9/11, and you\u2019re 30 when there\u2019s COVID. And I wonder, a) is crisis just a major backdrop to our lives and your life, and b) are 9/11 and COVID as big events in your mind as the 2008 financial crisis?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [53:30]: Well the funny thing is, the 2008 financial crisis is actually almost this non-event in my life because I was just too young for it to have actually had any real effect on my life! It didn\u2019t really have an effect on day to day living for me and my family.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Right, but I mean your thinking and your interests were changed \u2014 not changed, but awoken!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: I kind of just like, happened into [them]! It was obviously this topic that everyone was talking about and it\u2019s like, Well I want in on the conversation but I don\u2019t understand this! And when I get in on the conversation it turns out that, well, everyone is completely wrong about how all of this stuff works at all! The point is is that the event itself was not impactful on me, but the fallout of it, spurring an interest in economics, was extremely impactful on me. So I would say that 9/11 and COVID and stuff were much bigger events as far as an actual appreciable effect on me, because 9/11 I was quite young, but I certainly remember the effect that it had on the community around me. And COVID had obviously we were all stuck in our homes and stuff like that. I never had to wait in line to go to the grocery store and I know that\u2019s very minimal compared to the hardship that a lot of people have but I bring that example up because that was the first thing [where it] became apparent that something it for real different here! It\u2019s not like COVID was the first time there had been a scare about some kind of viral epidemic. In my childhood I remember there was monkey pox, SARS, a brief time in 2014 that people thought Ebola was gonna find its way over, so it was not the first time that there had been a scare of a viral epidemic, but it was the first time that it had been a viral epidemic that actually had an effect. [The line outside the grocery store] was of course just the beginning! Just wait, there\u2019s more!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [56:17]: Has COVID accelerated your thinking at all? I\u2019m not talking about COVID and restrictions and stuff \u2014 maybe you have less restrictions than other people \u2014 but has it accelerated your thinking, this event?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [56:31]: So being in Texas there haven\u2019t been nearly as many restrictions as for most people. My life has mostly been normal except I need to wear a mask when I go into retail environments. As far as accelerating, I had a Tweet about this like, 2020 turned everybody into normies! What\u2019s weird is that I don\u2019t actually feel that weird anymore! For a long time I was kind of the weird one because, Hey! I think that it would be better to homeschool kids than to send them to public school! I think that perhaps it\u2019s actually better to live away from a city! Instead of being in the middle of the city. Or I think people should probably have semi-automatic rifles at home for self-defense! I think people should have magic Internet money that they hold for the future! And all these things were a little crazier to say in 2019 than they were by the end of 2020. Now it\u2019s almost like, Yeah! Who doesn\u2019t want to go move out into the country! I mean everyone has had to homeschool to some extent and I\u2019m sure many people have kind of seen some of the benefits! So it has accelerated and I think it\u2019s great! You know I think it\u2019s terrible circumstances, but I do hope that in the fallout from that, people got shaken out of their norm in a way that can reorient them towards a more positive way of living life! So I\u2019m hoping that we can come out of all of these negative events with a better way of living. That\u2019s a little bit of optimism I have. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s unwarranted, but I\u2019m gonna hold it anyway!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [58:48]: I love optimism! I\u2019m fully optimistic that things will resolve themselves in the long term. I\u2019m not so optimistic in the short term! One thing I want to ask you about is, In the US today, when you see things like Gamestop and what\u2019s happening on Wall Street, and you have the Federal Reserve whether you like it or not \u2014 I\u2019m not speaking to you I\u2019m just saying in general \u2014 you have more restrictions than we\u2019ve ever had before, and I\u2019m not getting into the warrant of those restrictions and what\u2019s needed and what\u2019s not needed, but what I am getting at is, Do you think we\u2019re fully sovereign, or an individual can be fully sovereign in America today?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [59:34]: No! No. I mean I don\u2019t know if an individual can be fully sovereign ever.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Okay! I get what you\u2019re getting at there. Let\u2019s dial it back a little bit! Do you think that sovereignty is achievable at some individual level \u2014 you\u2019ve talked a little bit about this where we\u2019re a ways away from an individual being able to accumulate enough capital to take on the state and be sovereign. But in terms of, you can stack sats! You can be 100% Bitcoin! But, you\u2019re gonna get taxed if you spend and replace, most of society is still operating on fiat and central banking usury, and now the government I feel is \u2014 and whether it\u2019s on its last legs or not as Alex Svetski believes \u2014 it\u2019s sort of rearing its ugly head and involving itself more in our lives. And I feel more restrictions and more externalities than ever since I\u2019ve been involved with Bitcoin. Bitcoin gave me a lot of that freedom in my mind and a way to put myself out of circumstances I didn\u2019t want to deal with! Kind of like what you were talking about \u2014 why fix this field? If this field is horrible, let\u2019s go find another field and farm that land! I don\u2019t have to spend my life making this field better! But there\u2019s a part of me now that\u2019s like, I can\u2019t even find a field around here!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:01:11]: So I do think that Bitcoin does create a bit of sovereignty in people, because they can walk away from a lot of things in life that just kind of suck! Like there\u2019s just a rat race! I look around and there\u2019s a lot of people that are in a rat race that I\u2019m not quite as concerned about! For instance like having to be able to save money and then go an invest it or whatever. I feel like having Bitcoin in a portfolio helps slow that down. It\u2019s like, Well! You have your Bitcoin! You have this thing for the future! You don\u2019t have to be constantly looking for get rich quick schemes, which a lot of millennials seem to do! Which is I think what drives a lot of this Gamestop behavior! Some of the other forms of that \u2014 people just want to find the quick way out because it\u2019s the only way out! So Bitcoin kind of fixes that rat race a bit because even if you just have a normal wage job if you can just put a little bit away each paycheck, you\u2019re going to be making a lot of progress, especially as time goes on! We see what happens in four-year cycles! So I think that\u2019s going to have an even bigger effect on someone of lesser means! And so in a way that\u2019s sort of more sovereignty because it\u2019s like feeling less constrained by the universe! You don\u2019t have to worry as much about where food is gonna come from next week, and you can think more about a long term vision of stuff. And when you have that long term vision and the actual idea of what capital you\u2019ll have available to achieve that, when stuff like a tax or something comes up \u2014 Yeah we can all go on about how taxation is theft \u2014 but you\u2019ll also be able to take that reality into consideration much more easily! It\u2019s like, Okay! Yes! Add that cost of doing business, but that won\u2019t get in the way of my bigger vision! Yeah I don\u2019t know that anyone gets to true sovereignty, but you can always be accumulating that capital to be able to address and build towards those long term visions, even with certain constraints popping up!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:04:14]: Yeah. That was something that really struck deeply with me and you were talking with McCormack about how you speak of, The accumulation of capital is really how we make change in the world in our favor. I think that\u2019s very important!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah! Just on that topic, I think what people do need to realize is like, In order to do anything, you need to be able to do something! You can\u2019t eat unless you\u2019ve produced the food! So capital is a necessity, it\u2019s not \u2014 but I think when that word comes up it\u2019s often in a Marxian view where capital is seen as this being of its own that\u2019s above us or whatever. I view it as just tools. Capital is just tools. If you want things, you need capital! You need the tools in order to produce it, you need to accumulate capital so that you can address human wants beyond just what\u2019s in front of your face! You don\u2019t want to be the person who\u2019s living paycheck to paycheck which is what you\u2019re doing in the state of nature. Austrians like to talk about Robinson Crusoe economics, meaning the person who\u2019s stuck on an island! So you get thrown on a deserted island \u2014 when you start out, all you have is whatever berries and fish you can gather day after day. And it\u2019s not until you start finding a way to catch more than you actually consume that you can start to think beyond, What am I going to eat today? And once you can solve that problem, you can begin to solve a bigger problem. And it\u2019s only through that process of accumulating those tools \u2014 whether it\u2019s in the form of knowledge, physical productive factories or whatever, but you need that in order to actually, for real, solve the the problem, so you can get to bigger problems!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:06:22]: Right. Yeah I agree with everything you just said. I want to touch back on sovereignty of America. Something you touched on again in the McCormack conversation was neighbors. And the importance of choosing good neighbors! And that no man is an island kind of thing, and you\u2019re affected by your neighbors. Has your neighborhood changed over the last year? Maybe with an influx of people or something like that? And it seems like you\u2019re outside of town. I\u2019ll loop that in with a little bit of, What is your take on the word citadel, and are you in a citadel situation where your neighbors don\u2019t matter? Do you have a citadel in your mind, and your neighbors don\u2019t matter? Or are your neighbors getting better or worse? How are things going in the neighborhood?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:07:16]: I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever commented on my neighborhood, but I can certainly talk about the abstract. As far as citadels, the original Reddit post that citadels came from was this super-dystopian vision of the world where basically we lived in this Brazilified world where you have slums everywhere and then pockets of very wealthy people and they have these fortified areas to keep out the riff-raff. Like the movie Elysium or whatever \u2014 that\u2019s how this envisioned it, and if you don\u2019t get your Bitcoins then you\u2019re stuck outside of it! I don\u2019t really think about it like that! I actually think that a sound money economy will be good for everyone, rich and poor! And it will increase the quality of life for everyone who\u2019s able to denominate their economic life in Bitcoin rather than a fiat currency. Certainly there\u2019s going to be people who were able to buy thousands of Bitcoins and they\u2019re going to be uber-wealthy and I hope they enjoy their many yachts! Although more boats means more potential for boating accidents so I hope they stay safe out there! My vision for the so-called citadel has more to do with what Hoppe describes with city-states, and just having more localized governance! So that instead of being ruled over by a highly central organization that manages millions upon millions if not billions of people, you have localized governance systems that are more in control of their own private lives without the input of those groups. And with that, you then have more of those groups who are having to peacefully interact with one another because they rely on one another for trade of resources. And I think that just turns back the clock a little bit in some ways but also turns it forwards with the technological capabilities. Back to a time \u2014 massive centralization of state apparatuses is a new thing. Before the mid-1800s, Germany was hundreds of little nations! And same with Italy, and same with all of these places \u2014 a gazillion little micro-nations! And these places will tend to be generally more peaceful because they rely on one another, for one, and they\u2019re also inwardly focused on some things. I would recommend that people go \u2014 there\u2019s a Hoppe talk, The Advantages of Small States or something like that. He\u2019s gonna do a better job than me at explaining that! But that\u2019s more of what I think of with the citadel is more about localized governance so that people can find communities that best serve their individual needs as opposed to what a faceless bureaucracy thinks your life should be managed as.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:11:21]: I agree with you totally in terms of the external world! I really hope we don\u2019t end up in that feudal state where we have wastelands in between guarded \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: That would be very sad to me! That would be very sad if that happened.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah that\u2019s not the goal for me or what I\u2019m optimistic about! The citadel for me is more in my mind. To have as much sovereignty and independence and freedom as I can envision for myself within my mind! For me that goes back to Shawshank Redemption where Tim Robbins can find freedom in prison because this man is free wherever he goes, whereas Red was institutionalized and the moment he gets out of prison he wants to go back to prison and go back to the rules, and he doesn\u2019t want to be free because he\u2019s been institutionalized. So that\u2019s kind of my citadel, it\u2019s just always be as free as I could be in my mind, and find the tools in the real world that will expand my physical freedoms. Not to satiate physical needs, but to satiate my mental mindset."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:12:25]: Right! It\u2019s very much like Stoic thinking. And Epictetus himself was a slave! There was almost a need to develop a Stoic attitude to be able to understand it\u2019s like, I can be a slave and yet I am still in control of my own mind and how I react to things! So someone in that situation \u2014 more than certainly any of us \u2014 is really going to have an understanding of this having this citadel in your own mind!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: And you can go back to the Old Testament with Joseph being sold into slavery by his twelve brothers and rising to be the vizier of Egypt \u2014 from prison! So it\u2019s incredible what an individual can do! I really want to turn now to some of the fun stuff! How to meme Bitcoin to the moon! And the moon part is not so important to me, but it\u2019s really about meme warfare and meme ideology! Again this article was written a while ago and I think it\u2019s prophetic! The first thing I\u2019d like to ask you is, How do you define the memetic landscape?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:13:37]: So for those who don\u2019t know this was a talk that I gave at BitBlockBoom! in 2019.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah I do want to touch on that real quick! The introduction is, A lot of people talk about price fundamentals, but I\u2019m gonna talk about how to troll and take the curves hard! I\u2019m glad you brought it up \u2014 where this talk took place \u2014 because I wanted to go to that conference in my mind, but like, I was just stacking sats and we were in the middle of a bad market. It was really hard to convince my kids and my wife that I need to go to Texas to listen to these guys talk about this money that keeps going down in value in terms of US dollars! And in my mind I wasn\u2019t really worried about the USD denomination because I understood what I was getting into at that point, but it was hard to convince other people! It\u2019s like I\u2019m telling them, I want to go vote. And they\u2019re like, Yeah. Okay, cool! But maybe this is not the year. And I didn\u2019t get to go. And another reason there is it generally takes place on my birthday! Again \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna be here for my birthday, which is generally when we throw the biggest family party of the year because my daughter was born right after me, so it\u2019s not even my birthday party and I don\u2019t even tell people it\u2019s my birthday! So I didn\u2019t get to go, but I\u2019m sitting at home, and, Yo, that shit came across Twitter, and it lit a fire! That was the first time that Bitcoin entered the physical realm for me! Where I felt the vibrations! It felt like the mind hive \u2014 the human global consciousness. Bitcoin reverberated with me as an individual before that \u2014 I had sort of enlightening moments with Bitcoin, but this was where I was like, Holy fuckin\u2019 shit! People are actually getting together and creating this vibe in real life! And something electric is happening! And I think that your speech hit Twitter before you got off the stage! And I think you were even responding like, I didn\u2019t even know people could hear this at home!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: They\u2019re loose, and they themselves are like memes. Of course I was not intending \u2014 I do not want anyone to be physically bullying anyone! But when those words come up, for people who were not hearing the tone of it, I think they thought that I was using those words in a very direct way. Someone joked to me like, You can read that transcript in the voice of Mussolini and then you can understand why the \u2014 for instance Ethereum folks that were upset by it \u2014 why they were so upset! I was like, Yeah if you read it in that voice it\u2019s gonna be a bit upsetting! But that\u2019s also part of the fun of the talk, is these layers of rhetoric and how \u2014 I mean that itself illustrates an important point which is that the way you say things is going to be interpreted by literally everyone in their own way! And messages have to be crafted in a way where you\u2019re cognizant of that fact! Like I just know that even a lot of stuff in this podcast \u2014 someone\u2019s gonna be listening to it and they\u2019re gonna take something, that I meant something totally different than what I actually meant!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yep. I have those conversations with my wife after every show!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:18:18]: Yeah! It\u2019s just part of the landscape! So this was what the talk \u2014 one of the important themes of the talk was that we are in a rhetorical world. I think a lot of people have come to this understanding over the past few years. You know, facts don\u2019t really matter to a lot of people!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Can you talk a little bit about the difference between rhetoric and dialectic though? We are using these terms, and this talk \u2014 I mean first of all I thought it was witty and clever as fuck, but it was really hard for me to take this talk and put it to use, but I think it is a how-to in how to Tweet and what Twitter is about!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:19:16]: So rhetoric and dialectic \u2014 the idea there is, rhetoric is like persuasion. It is using different persuasion tactics to try to win someone over on an idea, or make someone feel a particular way. Whereas, dialectic is very much like dry debate! It\u2019s like, let\u2019s look at the facts, let\u2019s argue through the logic. Think of an Oxford-style debate! That would be a dialectic! A rhetoric is more like a United States presidential debate where you just get on stage and no one\u2019s trying to make a clear argument about like the system of government and, Here\u2019s why this not a good way to do things. I propose that we do this because XYZ \u2014 it\u2019s all a bunch of \u2014 it\u2019s a show! And the problem is a lot of people want to engage in dialectic because it\u2019s how you learn, you have to sit down and really think through things. But not everyone is having a good faith discussion! When you\u2019re on the Internet, there\u2019s millions, there\u2019s billions of people on there! So each one of those people is going to have a different interpretation of everything that\u2019s flying through the screen\u2014another problem with that is it\u2019s a very hostile environment! A lot of people I think they\u2019ve finally come to realize this: the Internet for a while had a hippy feel-good feeling to it, where it\u2019s like fun good times, people are nice, everyone\u2019s having fun!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: A lot of optimism about what the Internet could do!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah and I think more recently on Twitter the past couple of years there\u2019s been increasing hostility and people have really come to feel that!

When do you argue and when do you troll? When are you speaking to the echo chamber and when are you just trying to dominate?"}

So I think I put in the recommended reading on my talk a book called The Art of Controversy by Arthur Schopenhauer the philosopher.

All you have to do is turn it around with this jab and you\u2019ve totally destroyed him! So it\u2019s like the art of the troll from the 1800s! You know, these ideas, they have been around for a long time\u2014on the Internet, because there\u2019s such a high volume of information, we get to see more of these little argumentative simulations happen in real-time, and so we almost get a sharper sense of them. That\u2019s not to say \u2014 I don\u2019t want to suggest that we\u2019re better than Schopenhauer or something, we\u2019re better than Aristotle \u2014 Aristotle\u2019s gonna be better at dialectic than I am, and Schopenhauer\u2019s gonna be better at rhetoric than I am, and probably dialectic than me. And Aristotle also wrote on rhetoric \u2014 both of these guys are gonna be better at both than me! But, I\u2019ve probably seen more argumentation than they have, and so there\u2019s been more iterations. So in a way, I would guess that a lot of people today have sort of strengthened those muscles in ways that they couldn\u2019t have imagined! And the landscape is I\u2019m gonna guess much more chaotic than it had been, and it\u2019s engaging in much different media, so we also have to deal with like imagery! How does an image come across! Neil Postman in the 80s spoke in Amusing Ourselves to Death, where he was basically saying that television, the medium, totally changes our interaction with intellectual concepts because it sort of turns everything into cheap entertainment! Because everything now is based on these visual things rather than \u2014 he describes how normal Americans were going to the Lincoln-Douglass debates, which meant that normal Americans were sitting down and listening to Lincoln and Douglass engage in dialectic for like six hours straight! And they were able to take in all of those ideas! We don\u2019t have that landscape anymore! We have like, Here\u2019s a funny picture! And you could generate those extremely fast. We get on Twitter and we just have a constant stream of Tweets. It\u2019s a very heated battlefield! And yeah, I think if you don\u2019t have this attitude ready to understand that people are going to engage in rhetoric, troll one another, be hostile to one another, purposefully misinterpret one another \u2014 if you don\u2019t have that attitude, you\u2019re probably going to have a bad time!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:29:31]: Yeah. I\u2019m gonna just read off a little bit of this: Definitely know when to argue, when to troll. It\u2019s important to have echo chambers \u2014 it let\u2019s you cultivate a group of people who share these ideas. That\u2019s something that I kind of struggled with. I sometimes feel that we\u2019re in a Bitcoin echo chamber. I was definitely someone who was outside the echo chamber, and the Bitcoin echo chamber drew me in! I saw the Tweets, I don\u2019t know how they kept coming across my feed, but I couldn\u2019t argue with them, I couldn\u2019t refute them! So I do think it feeds out, but it is also about growing the group and giving an opportunity to get good feedback and information from the group. You\u2019re not really talking to the people who you are replying to on Twitter \u2014 it\u2019s for the other people! And it\u2019s really key to understand that! And you must understand who your actual audience is! I love this: relentless propaganda every single day! Just do it! Pump it out! This is good for Bitcoin, there is no bad news for Bitcoin! We must always anchor on the most bullish position! You should never be afraid to take the possibilities to their logical extreme, and from there work reality into your model with nuance as necessary, as needed, and as deserved. A no-coiner doesn\u2019t necessarily need to understand that, Oh we might be going to $99 million instead of $100 million \u2014 always give them the most bullish! Their opinion isn\u2019t merely wrong it\u2019s completely wrong \u2014 always be bullish! And one of your final \u2014 and this really struck with me \u2014 trigram memes are good! Think about three-word memes! That\u2019s what resonates right now!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:31:14]: The funny thing with that, I think a lot of people what they got from that was me saying that it\u2019s sort of a dictum like, Oh! Go find the three-word memes! It was actually supposed to be more of a positive observation of, When we look around and see what ideas have stuck, it\u2019s tended to be these three-word memes. That\u2019s just a pattern that has emerged. So that\u2019s me making an observation, not so much a dictum! Because if you took it as a dictum, then Have Fun Staying Poor would never have emerged! But that\u2019s an example of one that worked with more than three words!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:32:02]: Right but there\u2019s still an economy of scale there!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yes, and I think there\u2019s a reason, which is just like, We have so much information going through, you gotta be able to condense an idea into \u2014 it needs to be pure and distilled, and if you can\u2019t take an idea at both a distilled form and a very long interesting extrapolation of it, then it\u2019s not going to be as good! So like, you can read someone or play for someone the audiobook of The Bitcoin Standard \u2014 you can also just say: Number Go Up! It\u2019s both effectively the same thing! But you need that idea to be able to fill in for every type of discussion. So if it\u2019s a very long \u2014 you have time to read a book \u2014 discussion, you can read the book. But if it\u2019s an argument about the future of Bitcoin you can just say, Oh! Number Go Up!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:33:22]: And I think it\u2019s important to know when you\u2019re speaking to the out group, there are certain techniques for that. You go over re-framing, agreeing, and amplifying, and the concept of dominating. So the importance of reframing is that no person in the out group should be defining your narrative for you! If that happens for you you lose! And one way that you mention of reframing is if someone is actually anti-Bitcoin, they\u2019re a Bitcoin accelerationist!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Which they totally are!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Right! And just reframe that shit on their ass! And dominate that conversation!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yeah a great example also is with Bitcoin energy. You have these, Oh! Bitcoin wastes energy! And they go on about how Bitcoin uses as much energy as however many millions of households. And a lot of people are tempted to say, Well, actually it doesn\u2019t use so much energy because blah blah blah. Thankfully this has evolved more towards, Actually the energy use is just good, because it\u2019s progressing humankind! But the point is, we shouldn\u2019t allow them to be sitting around having to argue whether or not Bitcoin is good. We already know Bitcoin is good and that its energy use is good! We should instead say as much, and point out how, Yeah, we\u2019re going to be using energy, and here\u2019s why that is great!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:34:50]: And what I really like about this at the end is, You never need to give an apology, especially to a nocoiner! Reject nocoiner orthodoxy! Do not fall into their frame! Show no mercy, always remind them Orange coin good! Number Go Up! And you do give some good advice at the end: You need to get your knowledge down to be a good memer! You need to do the work to prove it! And you talk a little bit about the end. Ethical trolling is more than just getting a rise out of people. You get back to, Stick to the truth! Don\u2019t just troll the troll! And part of sticking to the truth is having a low time preference. Sticking to the things that are true so that the truth give you long term focus that gives you long term content for perpetuity! I think that\u2019s very important. I\u2019ll definitely open it up to you for any more meme advice from the memelord!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:35:53]: Well there\u2019s plenty of people out there who just say they are just trolling for the sake of trolling. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m personally interested in. There can be a certain entertainment value of that, but the reason I talk about Bitcoin at all is not because I just want to troll people! It\u2019s because I actually believe in Bitcoin and I want more people to become Bitcoiners so that they can also share in the wonderful gifts that Bitcoin has to offer! So with that, yeah! We need to actually understand how Bitcoin operates if we want to be able to communicate that, no matter in what form we end up communicating that best. So it could be best that you\u2019re talking in a very trollish tone sometimes. It could be better for other people to be doing academic research or whatever. But the point is either way, in order to be able to craft the best message whatever that best message might actually be, you\u2019re gonna have to actually understand how does this thing function. And once again, because I am interested in doing this because I actually believe in Bitcoin, I also want to make sure I understand what I believe in! I don\u2019t just want to be believing things just for the heck of it! I also hope that the people who do get brought in\u2014and I think they do!\u2014there tends to be this great culture in Bitcoin where once people are brought in, they\u2019re lured in because it is so strange and interesting, and then they themselves find themselves going down that rabbit hole of learning more! Which has some funny consequences because you get situations where you have tons of people swarming someone on Twitter for saying something stupid about Bitcoin, and that person might actually think, Oh! Are these bots? Is this coordinated? What is going on here? It\u2019s not coordinated! I mean maybe there\u2019s a case somewhere, but by and large it\u2019s not a coordinated effort! What it is, is a lot of people have come to the same conclusion! So it\u2019s because there\u2019s been this distributed learning process that you also have this distributed response system.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:38:36]: It\u2019s remarkable and I really appreciate your vision in all this! My final question for you is related to the great unseen. So you seem to have \u2014 and I don\u2019t want to put words in your mouth \u2014 but 1) you seem to have a great appreciation for music, I\u2019ve noticed you like Fela Kuti. I\u2019ve noticed you put Pavarotti for four minutes before Scaramucci came on in your latest podcast."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: I do like Pavarotti though!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: But the two of you signed off on it! And I\u2019m listening to the podcast and I\u2019m honestly questioning myself if I\u2019m on the right track for the first four minutes. And the longer it went the more I was impressed! The balls! And really, the chutzpah! I loved it. And you set your articles to music, but you also use imagery very well! And you speak a lot about, it seems to me, the buffalo! The reinvigoration of the great American West! And so my final question for you is like, What does that mean to you? The rejuvenation or the vision or the future of the Western Frontier? And the rejuvenation via animal life or carnivory? What does that mean to you? And I\u2019m wondering when are you moving to Colorado? I\u2019m not talking about borders, I\u2019m just talking about expansive land with moutains and hills and buffalo roaming!"}

{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Yes! I mean look, I\u2019m a Texan and so I think I\u2019ve always had sort of a \u2014 always in that background was a romantic view of the West and frontier culture is very much present in Texan culture! As far as that, I think the whole meat thing is a rabbit hole unto itself, but I think our society is not well aligned with the environment, and I don\u2019t say that because I want to take us back to a pre-Industrial society or something like that! I actually think that a free market would be more conducive to ecological sustainability. But part of that is we just see a lot of ecosystems being destroyed and I want to see that reversed! And a less popular opinion \u2014 although it\u2019s gaining in popularity \u2014 is that large ruminants are good for an ecosystem, rather than harmful! So the common belief is that cow farts are going to destroy the climate. And so you need to stop eatin meat, we need to end factory farming \u2014 all of this stuff. Basically end meat production more generally speaking because it is destroying the environment! But I have the opinion \u2014 and people can look into this by studying Allan Savory and others \u2014 there\u2019s a book that recently came out called Sacred Cow that brings up more of the environmental issues. But basically large ruminants are a vital part of the ecosystem! Because they break down the soil, aerate, which allows the soil to capture more nutrients, they shit, which also brings nutrients back to the ground. They\u2019re very much part of the actual lifecycle! The animals were there! We followed the animals into America! Not we specifically in terms of my ancestors, but humans as a species followed large ruminants across the Bering Strait and down into the Americas. These animals have always been a part of the ecosystem, and it\u2019s absurd that they\u2019re suddenly causing a problem, when in fact we can see when you introduce more of these animals and manage the herds well, they revitalize these ecosystems and they can bring back grasslands to places that have completely lost their grasses. You have a desertification of some landscapes, but once you have those animals stomping around and shitting and all of that, you get the grass back, and then it\u2019s full of life again! So I want to see more regenerative agriculture! I\u2019m obviously a big meat-eater and I care more about the ruminants, but also other styles of agriculture for other products can also be brought into a more regenerative production cycle, and I think that\u2019s better for humans as well. I think it probably increases the quality. It certainly increases the quality of the environment that we get to enjoy! I\u2019d like going out into nature and seeing nature so it\u2019d be kind of sad if all that lost its life because we\u2019ve failed to maintain it through these practices. Anyway, I think people, as far as the buffalo in the American west, I think people greatly underestimate just how many bison there were running around the American Plains! They had herds that were miles wide that would take people days to cross, to get from one side of the herd to the other! These things were just absolutely massive, and they were all part of a thriving ecosystem and I think we can bring that back!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:45:55]: Yeah.

Something about names \u2014 it\u2019s a lifeblood! People\u2019s last name is like Butcher \u2014 they\u2019ll do meat! Whatever it is. It\u2019s really amazing to me."}

{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: That\u2019s interesting! When I went to prep for the show I started from the beginning, and I\u2019d almost forgotten how much I had digested of your work, how important it was to me! And I say that sensitively in the terms of like, when I was reading your work in 2019 I wasn\u2019t podcasting, I was just consuming writing about Bitcoin, it wasn\u2019t important to me necessarily who wrote it or the consistency of the voice from piece to piece. So if I had visited you in March of 2019 and came back in December of 2019, I was linking some of it but I had read a tremendous amount of stuff in between, maybe I had caught you in a podcast or two \u2014 or ten \u2014 in between. But I was just digesting for the sake of taking it in! And the pieces I do want to focus on which are Money, Bitcoin, and Time, the Tyranny of Time Scarcity, and Masters and Slaves of Money, those pieces are really important to me because Money, Bitcoin, and Time is a piece that stands with I think The Bitcoin Standard and Vijay\u2019s The Bullish Case For Bitcoin. It takes a lot of those same principles and distills them, and I think in a very complex yet simple to digest way! And when I revisited your work though, I really started to get bigger themes than I had picked up the first time. [02:57] Not only was I like, You\u2019ve got a mountain of work! I have it all here all printed out! And I\u2019m going through it and I\u2019m like, Wow this is a mountain of work! And I still had to read it again maybe two more times, but I\u2019m like, I remember this! This is all coming back to me! These are the stories I tell when I try to explain Bitcoin! I just didn\u2019t necessarily remember the author per se! So they\u2019re very important pieces to me. So just thinking about Bitcoin and time and money: how is money a story told by humans?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [03:33]: Yeah I\u2019m glad you zeroed in on the Money, Bitcoin, and Time piece. It was actually the first thing that I wrote about Bitcoin, and similar to you I was just digesting for a number of years \u2014 about two years before I wrote that piece. I guess I published that at the end of 2018? January 2019. So I had been going down the rabbit hole since the end of 2016, so a little over two years of studying nonstop like you had just described. And that was pretty much a synthesis of everything I had learned up until that point. So actually it drew heavily from The Bitcoin Standard, it drew heavily from Vijay\u2019s work, and the work of many others. And I tried to just weave it into a case for Bitcoin from first principles. And the first principles being that money is this story told by mankind. You could also call it a social construct, it\u2019s like a social technology. And something like the calendar, right? A calendar is a social technology related to that which has an interesting connection to time. Probably many of the listeners have read the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari. Harari calls these the imaginary constructs that humanity is able to generate these abstractions or useful fictions around which we can orient and concert human action. So these include money, the nation state, human rights, various abstractions. And this ability to generate imagined orders and fight and die for a symbol, basically, is what makes humanity the dominant species in the world. A gorilla troop can mobilize 150 gorillas or whatever to go to battle, but humanity can unite tens of thousands of soldiers under a flag! So we gain this ability to allocate human energy and socioeconomic across space and time in a more precise, directed, and concerted fashion by using symbols or stories than any other animal in the world. Ergo, we dominate the world! [06:15] So in that sense, money is probably the most important story mankind has ever told! It is the original social construct. And that piece attempts to go through the evolution of money, how it\u2019s changed over time, and how it\u2019s actually a tool for storing and transacting time, and you could say time or energy \u2014 because everything mankind produces requires time or energy. And another way to think about money is as the most tradable asset in an economy and the most liquid asset, so it represents a claim on everything else. It can be traded for anything else man\u2019s time or energy can produce. So it is this timeless story or timeless social construct, but it also reflects the storage of mankind\u2019s time and energy in a tradable form."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [07:17]: Right! And would you say that \u2014 you know I think a lot about what Michael Saylor talked about with networks. Are humans networks? And hardwired for exchange? And why would that be? And what is that network?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [07:31]: Yeah! I think Naval has described humanity as the networked species. And the simple case that humanity is more productive under a cooperative division of labor \u2014 meaning that there\u2019s this kernel to economics called the comparative advantage, which is: you make hats faster than I make boots\u2014you and I both benefit by specializing in hats and boots respectively and trading with one another. We increase output per man-hour of hats and boots by specializing and trading. And we need one another. We are more productive functioning inter-dependently than we are in isolation. That\u2019s the thing! You could almost think of us as a collective organism in a way. We can satisfy more individual wants cooperating than we can living in isolation. And you can\u2019t avoid that! It\u2019s math, right? All the luxuries that we enjoy today, no man could singularly produce them. Another great book that goes into this is The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley. And he talks about a computer mouse in the first chapter. And he says that there is no individual on Earth that knows how to make a computer mouse! No one! No one can do it! It\u2019s this complex configuration of trade networks and specialization and learning and heuristics and tools and resources and technologies that all inter-connect in this network that output the computer mouse. But you cannot pluck any human on Earth off the Earth and put him on a desert island and say, Build a computer mouse! There\u2019s no one that could do it! So we need one another! Social cooperation is the advantage by which we become more productive and wealthy."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [09:28]: Yeah. Through social cooperation we\u2019ve become more productive and wealthy. That speaks to prosperity. And I think the key lesson from your writings is time preference and it really helped me understand that. And maybe you could talk about how individuals can build prosperity through generations. Maybe talking about Harold and Louis and the fishing pole. And I just thought that was remarkable where first we had the micro, and I think that was where I was in 2019, just to kind of lead the story a little bit of where they\u2019re kind of figuring out where they\u2019re gonna specialize or spend their time. And when I revisited it or think about it more deeper it\u2019s really the macro over generations!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [10:20]: Yeah it\u2019s a cumulative effect, right? So we\u2019re building \u2014 as we trade and specialize, each of the trading partners then gets additional free time. They get the same level output in the same time, therefore they have basically discovered this new amount of time in their day, and they can spend that time producing further or they could spend it in leisure. But if you produce further, then you create more time savings, and there\u2019s a compounding effect. And it builds itself in layers throughout history. So the simple example of that which is in Money, Bitcoin, and Time, and this is one that came out of The Bitcoin Standard, is \u2014 I gave the example of two primitive trading partners, Harold and Louis. Actually it was named H and L to signify Harold, with a high time preference \u2014 meaning he\u2019s more short-term oriented \u2014 and then Louis, with a low time preference \u2014 which means he\u2019s more long-term oriented. And both Harold and Louis are alone on an island. They subsist by eating fish. They both start just catching fish with their bare hands. And they can basically spend eight hours a day catching fish with their bare hands \u2014 enough to fill their belly for the day. So it\u2019s a full days work for a full days food, essentially. Louis, having the lower time preference, thinking out into the future of how he can bootstrap himself out of this primitive situation, decides that he can forego eating \u2014 he can go a little bit hungry a few days a week \u2014 maybe he could only fish six hours a day and have a little extra two hours of fasting at the end of every day, and spend those two hours constructing a fishing rod! And I think the example is, at the end of two weeks, Louis has successfully constructed a fishing rod that now allows him to collect a full days worth of fish in say three hours. Whereas Harold, with a high time preference, is still spending eight hours a day just to eat! So now all of a sudden Louis is saying, Alright, I\u2019m catching as many fish as Harold in just three hours of work using this fishing rod. I\u2019m full, I\u2019ve got enough food for the day, I\u2019ve now got this five additional hours that I could spend doing whatever I want. So he could just take that and be lazy! But again, he\u2019s Louis! He\u2019s got a low time preference \u2014 he\u2019s thinking about the future! So he\u2019s like, I figure I\u2019m gonna go out and build a net, or construct a boat, or all these other tools that help you catch more fish per man-hour. This process feeds back on itself, and then before you know it, it\u2019s Harold sitting by the river bank spending eight hours a day subsisting on fish. Louis is out to sea in his boat with his net, his spear, his harpoon \u2014 everything he\u2019s developed \u2014 and he\u2019s catching not only more fish per man-hour, but fish in the deeper sea so he\u2019s catching higher quality fish! He\u2019s improving his quality of life! And then if he passes these lessons on to the next generation, and the next generation is born with all the advantages \u2014 all the capital and learnings that he\u2019s accumulated over his lifetime \u2014 then they can start that process again from the boat! And then this process builds throughout history until you have these giant fishing ships we have that go into the deep sea and lay trawls of net for miles and miles, and bring back millions of fish they sell on the market. So this is the compounding effect that a lower time preference gives you. And this points to the kernel of all economics, which is delayed gratification. You\u2019re consuming less today to create savings for tomorrow. Or to innovate to create more savings for tomorrow. And it\u2019s these layers of savings that civilization is built on!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [14:53]: Yeah and I even think you say paradoxically a world that consistently defers consumption will actually end up consuming more in the long run as its increased savings would increase the investment and productivity thus making its citizens wealthier in the future. When I read that piece I was very inspired by Louis! And I felt like I was Louis embarking on Bitcoin at that time. Now I feel like I\u2019m in the middle. At the beginning of 2021 I feel like I\u2019m in the middle of that longer cycle where I\u2019m the seventh generation of Harold, maybe. And we\u2019re stuck in this fiat world! The beginning and the after \u2014 the beginning\u2019s out of my control \u2014 and in 2019 I really felt like I was embarking on a much more \u2014 I saw a lot more light! I do want to turn to some more of the macro of price signals. We\u2019ve talked a little about time preference and the micro, but the price signals \u2014 why are those so important in terms of like a unit of account?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [16:01]: Yeah there\u2019s actually a number of ways to look at this. First of all I have to define what a price is. And I like to relate this to language, actually. It\u2019s kind of like the price signal, you can think of as an economic telecommunications network! So the price is just saying that everything\u2019s trading in the world, and so everything trades at some ratio of everything else. A house may be worth eleven cars, or a car might be worth ten hot dogs. Everything trades at a ratio of everything else. These exchange ratios clearly would be very complicated if that\u2019s how we traded. We\u2019d always have these barter exchange ratios! So what happens in an economy is \u2014 again that most tradable asset which is by definition money \u2014 everything gets priced in terms of money. And this simplifies trading in terms of calculation, execution, negotiation, and so what you have there is a mechanism of comparison, and this is similar to language in that words have sense in relation to one another. There\u2019s an argument that you can trace it all the way back to where someone is holding up a rock and saying, Rock, and that word doesn\u2019t have meaning in relation to words, it has meaning to the rock. And that\u2019s true, but once you further out into the linguistic sphere, you have context and grammar and syntax \u2014 all these things are relational. So we\u2019re deriving meaning from language, based on the relationship and configuration of words. The same is true in our economy: we derive meaning from human action based on the configuration of prices. So people are going into the world staking their time, energy, capital, in an attempt to solve problems or satisfy wants for others, and the game is to generate more outputs than you made inputs. So I put in X time, energy, capital, that has a certain market value. I want to create a product or a service or a piece of knowledge that earns me more time, money, and capital in the end. But all those decisions are guided by the decisions of others. Everyone is competing to satisfy wants for one another over time, so the price is the informational bearer on how much things cost! How much are inputs and outputs worth! So this entire system is what coordinates entrepreneurial action. So this game we\u2019re all playing where we\u2019re trying to figure out, How to better satisfy the wants of people? How do I improve human productivity? How do I render value to people? We just define value as whatever people want! So there\u2019s a lot of wants out there, and you go out and satisfy them profitably. That is the game of economics, and that game is governed by prices. So that is the informational signal that is propagating throughout the economy. What\u2019s incredible about it is that it adds so much efficiency to decision-making! And the simple example there was, if there was an earthquake in Chile that disrupted the flow of copper, all the market actors in the world \u2014 no one needs to know the why, no one needs to know about the earthquake, no one needs to know about the destruction \u2014 they just need to see that the price of copper went up! By that occurring, you\u2019ve changed the incentive structure for all users of copper. So people buying copper will either buy less or they\u2019ll seek substitutes, and all the producers of copper will produce more, because the market\u2019s bearing a higher price for it! So this market signal is how economic systems coordinate themselves and correct disruptions. So this disruption in the flow of copper into the world economy would be self-regulated or self-corrected through the price signal! And all done in a way that you don\u2019t need to sit down with a simple planning committee and say, Hey! There was a disruption to the flow of copper, we need to decide how much we\u2019re gonna send here and there. The other way to think about this is, the free market is the ultimate distributed computing network! We\u2019re all inter-connected by the price signal. Each individual node \u2014 which is each individual human or entrepreneur \u2014 they have maximal knowledge of their localized situation, right? You know, whatever business you\u2019re in, you know that business better than anyone else, and you\u2019re communicating information about that business into your market through your buying and selling decisions. That\u2019s constantly reshaping the price signal for others, and the same thing\u2019s happening from all other nodes, so you\u2019re getting information back to the price signal. So it\u2019s a self-organizing economic network communicated through the price signal. So it\u2019s like the nerve signal of the world economy, is another way to think about it."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [21:39]: Right. So we laid out a little bit about the economic gamification of money and how we\u2019re networked. But now we need a kind of way to keep score, so you need a ledger! Before we get to Bitcoin, we\u2019ve actually had an example of a transparent ledger before on a very small scale on the Yap Islands. If you would maybe talk a little bit about how they kept track of money through the Rai stones in a transparent way?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [22:08]: Yeah! So that was a super interesting ancient monetary system because it most closely resembled what we see with the Bitcoin open source ledger, basically! Rai stones were giant stones, like you couldn\u2019t move them by hand, it took dozens of guys to retrieve these things \u2014 I think from quarries. And they had a very particular shape. There was a significant amount of work necessary to procure them, which we could think of as akin to the Proof-of-Work that limited their supply. So you couldn\u2019t just print Rai stones \u2014 that was very important! So they had scarcity in the marketplace. But they lacked some other monetary properties like divisibility and portability. You couldn\u2019t move them easily \u2014 these are giant, multi-ton rocks. You couldn\u2019t divide them easily. So the Yap Islanders kept track of it with an open source ledger, effectively! Everyone on the marketplace would trade, and then when they would decide that part of the stone had been traded for some other good or service, they would announce this \u2014 literally verbally announce this to the marketplace \u2014 everyone had their own individual ledger, and they would record the trades. So that was a distributed ledger, effectively, that truth was established by consensus, and then no one could go and change their individual ledger and say, Oh this trade didn\u2019t happen! Because then it wouldn\u2019t reconcile to the others. So it\u2019s very similar to what Bitcoin does, in that \u2014 that\u2019s what every node and miner in the world was doing \u2014 it\u2019s checking the work of every other node and miner. Consensus is reached in a distributed fashion! Was that the original question?"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [23:58]: Yeah. To continue that thought, that was hard money at first! Hard in the sense that it was hard to produce, hard to forge, not hard in the sense that it was a rock, but hard in the sense that it was hard to procure, until David O\u2019Keefe arrived, and turned hard money into what we would call soft money today.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [24:19]: That\u2019s right! And we\u2019ve seen this a number of times throughout history. Another example are the glass beads in Africa. But historically, markets have tried to zero on the asset that best satisfies the properties of money. And we can think about this as the services money renders! We want money that can be divisible, durable, recognizable, portable, and scarce. In the case of the Yap Islanders, they had figured out a system that satisfied those five properties, that provided those five services. However, once O\u2019Keefe arrived, he basically technologically disrupted this monetary system, because he had dynamite, he had boats, he could go out and quarry these rocks much more cheaply, so therefore he could compromise the scarcity of the money, and use it to acquire things in the market and diminish the value of the money. And that\u2019s exactly what happened! I think it was coconut oil that he was trying to procure from them? And he saw that they were using these stones as money. He realized that he could go back and get some dynamite, come here, mine huge quantities of these stones very easily, and then use it to acquire a ton of coconuts and then you could go sell these back in a different market. And glossing over some of the detail, that\u2019s more or less what happened. The Yap Islanders tried to resist initially, but he was able to get through to a few of them. And then the entire monetary system collapsed! So the lesson there is: if someone can produce a money more cheaply than others, they essentially control the monetary system, or they can disrupt it down to the point of the cost of production of that money. And we see a similar dynamic with central banking today. Where they\u2019re producing money at zero cost, confiscating wealth from all users of the money, and driving it into the ground, frankly, over time!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [26:15]: This is for me the hinge of the work that we\u2019re gonna explore today, and the hinge of money in a lot of ways! And before we dive a little bit deeper into that hinge on a more specific micro-level \u2014 I\u2019m curious on your thoughts on how China and India dealt with gold and silver? And moving towards what the world considered to be the standard, and how that might have affected their societies from a wealth preservation perspective?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [26:45]: Yeah. So they\u2019re good canaries in the coal mine, I think historically, for what we will see for countries and groups that resist Bitcoin going forward. As Saifedean brilliantly says \u2014 and I\u2019m gonna paraphrase it \u2014 history shows that it is impossible to ignore the consequences of someone else holding a money that is harder than yours! So this inflation-resistant quality of money, it is a game that imposes itself! You can\u2019t just isolate yourself or your economy or your nation from someone else holding a harder money than you, because what will effectively happen is that there\u2019s more demand from a money that holds its value across time, so capital will be absorbed by a hard money economy, making them wealthier relative to the softer money economy, giving the hard money economy the advantage over the soft money economy. And the example there was China and India obstinately holding out on the silver standard while the world was moving to a gold standard, and it just kept playing out! England was I think the first to move to the gold standard, and then the game theory kept playing itself out that other countries realized that they had to adopt a gold standard to remain competitive, and then eventually it was China and India were the two players remaining on the silver standard. And that\u2019s why England was able to colonize much of India! It basically became an English commonwealth, because you had English people on a gold standard able to go in and buy vast amounts of Indian capital and land and resources. And then control it for many generations! Similar thing played out in China, but I believe that led to the Maoist revolution, actually. That there was such a breakdown on wealth that they eventually had a revolution. I might be mixing the chronology up there but the moral of the story is: China was economically plundered by remaining on the silver standard relative to countries that moved on to the gold standard. So in a Bitcoin lens it\u2019s similar \u2014 the game theory is: it cannot be ignored or argued away! It\u2019s: whoever holds the hardest money is going to accumulate the most economic value."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [29:24]: Yeah. How much do you think it set back those civilizations till today? If they had maybe gone to gold sooner? I mean dealing with colonization and just the wealth of the society within the society? Do you think they would be very different places today if they had moved to a gold standard earlier? Do you think there would be more peace there or something?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [29:49]: Oh of course. I mean, had they adopted the gold standard much earlier I think it would have changed their entire history! They would have been much more powerful and wealthier today. There would have been a lot less suffering between then and now, but as good as gold was, the Achilles\u2019 heel is that it still introduced the need to trust the custodians. Trust the banks. And the economies of scale associated with transacting \u2014 meaning that it\u2019s very heavy and difficult to move around \u2014 so there\u2019s a big cost associated with transacting with gold. So this led to the centralization of custody. And then governments \u2014 which have the monopoly on violence \u2014 they inevitably co-opt the gold supply such that it can become a revenue stream for the treasury. They can just borrow whatever they need! And that\u2019s why the gold standard always breaks down and ends up in fiat, in my opinion. Because these custodians \u2014 it\u2019s absolute power corrupts absolutely! You give a custodian absolute power over the gold supply, they inevitably issue more bank notes or warehouse receipts than the gold reserves can justify, and the entire standard becomes compromised over time! Again it compromises scarcity of money by abstracting it in a paper currency. So as good as good was as a force for civilization, this Achilles\u2019 heel always led to its ultimate abuse and breakdown."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [31:31]: Turning to Masters and Slaves of Money, and I think drawing out bigger macro conclusions here about how money is used. And something Michael Saylor said I think in the first episode of the Saylor Series was something along the lines of, There\u2019s no fair fight in nature! You\u2019re never gonna take on a fair fight in the real wild. And is some of this interplay between countries and fiat and money just part of nature? And I ask that from a \u2014 obviously we would get more if we collaborated, and I do think reciprocity is a big part of our internal nature! But maybe not within the most ambitious or politically connected or powerful people \u2014 I\u2019m not sure. But within the competition of groups, is something like when Nixon, or America, went off the gold standard, is that just America taking the world down in an unfair fight?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [32:47]: So money is very closely related to biological nature, and I\u2019m gonna write some of this in my upcoming book. I\u2019m tempted to just cover it at a high level here. So in nature \u2014 and this is all organisms \u2014 one of the most deeply rooted primordial organic impulses is the territorial imperative. So animals want to take territory, protect territory, and so you could say they seek to expand their dominion over space, but I argue too that \u2014 again, as Einstein taught us, space and time are the same thing \u2014 it also applies to time. So animals seek to increase their genetic dominion over time, which is reproduction. We\u2019re all trying to reproduce and spread genes as far and wide as possible. The territorial imperative of biology is expressed in man as property rights. This is how we determine who owns what in the world. Who owns what space, who owns command over other peoples\u2019 time. This is all embodied in what property rights you have accumulated for yourself. The highest property right in an economy is money. It is the meta-property right that holds claim to all other property rights. So that is the deep connection I think here. And that\u2019s why people are crazy about money, by the way. If you\u2019ve ever who\u2019s lost money, or money can also make people crazy, it\u2019s getting to the deep circuitry of who we are! And to that end I do think that our modes of social organization, they can exhibit these predator and prey dynamics, where you\u2019ll see \u2014 again it\u2019s all about inputs and outputs at the end of the day. We think individually and individually we are compassionate, by the way, with our local group, and what people do well \u2014 we want to have reciprocal altruism in all of these things. However that compassion does not scale! Again, back to the Dunbar number that\u2019s kind of the limit of what organic societies can mobilize with apps and collective imagined order like we described earlier. You can\u2019t really scale biologically beyond that Dunbar number of 150 or so odd people. So if you look at nations or some larger groups, it would be a lot more cutthroat! So if there\u2019s a way that the collective can earn more outputs from \u2014 if there\u2019s a way for individuals operating a collective like state governors or military officials, they can input less energy than they can get in output. So they can enforce a monopoly on violence and impose taxation that costs them X, and then they get tax revenue that equals X + 1, they will do that, right? It\u2019s an economics game! It\u2019s not how you feel about the people, it\u2019s very ruthless in that way. So in that way that\u2019s what I think you see happen throughout history with this disruption of monetary orders, economics game. And that\u2019s what drives the market by the way! To zero in on the money that is most resistant to theft, supply manipulation, because at the end of the day, people have learned through these countless market iterations that, I need to store my wealth \u2014 this accumulation of time and energy savings, the fruits of my labor \u2014 I need to store it in a form of money that can\u2019t be inflated, confiscated, deauthorized, and that money was gold! It was trust-minimized money is another way to say it. So that\u2019s what made gold, gold. But again the drawback was the custody and portability issue. Gold was an insufficient [inaudible 37:13] so we couldn\u2019t move it easily, we couldn\u2019t beam it over telecommunication channels, so it did not keep up. It forced us to need to trust custodians to warehouse that gold and maintain that currency peg 1:1, that trust is always abused until it falters. To get to why the US had established itself as the gold standard is again about gold. In World War II, every time Nazi Germany would invade a country, the first place they would go is straight to that country\u2019s central bank and hoard their gold reserves. They did this in Poland, they did this with a few others. And very quickly many European countries wised up to this and said, We need to ship our gold out and store it somewhere that Nazis can\u2019t plunder, and it just so happened by geographic happenstance that North America became that safe haven! So as a result of World War II, a lot of gold \u2014 most of the world\u2019s [gold] \u2014 ends up in North America, and then surprise, surprise, end of the war, US steps in, [passes] the remaining opponents that are all war-weary, they\u2019ve been fighting, they\u2019re resources are diminished, and US is holding all the gold, so we sent out people in, we finished the job, we then hold a peace conference to rewrite the banking system rules to our own favor. So we say that the US dollar will be pegged to gold, all other national currencies will be pegged to the US dollar, so we\u2019re on this gold standard, but it\u2019s a gold standard that the US controls, because now the world is trusting the US to be the gold custodian effectively in this model. And that was 1944. 30 years later, the world sees that the US is producing way too many dollars than its gold reserves can justify, countries start demanding settlement in gold. They want to sell their dollars and repatriate gold. And eventually it gets to a point where the US says, We\u2019ve had enough of this! And they stop, they close the gold window in the infamous 1971 Nixon shock. I think it was Germany that tried to repatriate their gold when the US decided that they didn\u2019t have enough. And that moved the world into this totally uncharted territory of a global fiat standard. And if you just look at the socioeconomic data ever since, things have gotten really bad in a lot of ways."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [39:47]: Yeah. WTF Happened in 1971? Yeah we had those boys on, that was great! I would like to take this lens that you\u2019ve been delving into, and in your words, you\u2019ve spoken about how money is frozen time. And if you can pilfer or take someone\u2019s time, that can be staff, you could be stealing \u2014 that\u2019s powerful! Let\u2019s take that lens and turn it now back a little bit towards the aggry beads in Africa and what happened there. Before we get back to the power that the central banks have now, that we\u2019ve broken the peg and we\u2019re no longer pegged to gold. So we can understand and benchmark how much time was stolen over history, in this one example, and then what is going on now? And this is the thing that really blew my mind when I came back to this article. This piece of yours! Because the first time when I read it, I was a little, Yeah yeah Robert, Okay! Meaning, this is really big heavy stuff that is not maybe affecting me in modern times! And now revisiting it 18 months later it read very differently. It read much more clearly that this is happening! So I just want to illuminate what has happened in that prior example before we dive into what\u2019s going on now.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [41:28]: Yeah so I assume you\u2019re saying [you\u2019re reading it] pre-COVID, post-COVID."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Yeah that is the hinge and the perspective change is really powerful post-COVID, and pre-COVID I felt like, Hey, I\u2019m king of the ship! I\u2019m accumulating Bitcoin, everything is gonna take care of itself! In 2021, I\u2019m like, Well maybe stacking satoshis is not really gonna solve all of my problems, but this is a key and a lens into solving a lot of my problems. It\u2019s not everything but it\u2019s a big part of my life, and the biggest part outside of my family and friends. But things are getting bigger outside of my control. I\u2019m feeling differently about externalities.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [42:25]: It\u2019s definitely the COVID situation has been an accelerant to all of our thinking and perspective on the world and it\u2019s just incredible how fast things change! It blew me away! And I\u2019m a guy that\u2019s been staring at this and just to see it happen I was completely floored! So I can only imagine what it\u2019s like for others, it\u2019s gotta be similar at least. We see another dynamic similar to the Yap Islanders in that aggry beads were small decorative glass beads that were used as money for centuries in Western Africa. This is around the 16th century that Europeans begin landing on African shores. They\u2019re doing expeditions both exploratory and trading expeditions. And shrewd Europeans discern that, Hey! These Africans are using these small glass beads as money! There\u2019s glass-making facilities back in Europe that I can mass-produce these things. I can counterfeit these things en masse and I can bring these things into the market and acquire all of these goods and services that the African economy can offer, basically at a discount. So just like O\u2019Keefe collapsing the production cost of Rai stones with the Yap Islanders, Europeans are able to collapse the production cost of aggry beads in Western Africa and thereby use it as a mechanism for confiscating their wealth. To your point earlier, if wealth is just this accumulation of time saved or it\u2019s frozen time, we could say both money and capital are both a form of frozen time or energy, and time and energy has to be invested to create them. And then capital and money \u2014 money could be used to claim time from other people, capital can be used to improve your productivity which is to say to increase your returns on time spent. You can dig a hole faster per man hour with a shovel than you can with bare hands, you can catch more fish per hour with a fishing rod than you can with your bare hands, etc. So what happened was a surreptitious confiscation of African wealth over time, that these expeditions kept coming in. Africans actually could discern a little bit that some of these beads were counterfeit and there was a little bit of resistance at times, but that just fed back into better counterfeiting, and before you know it it became all mixed up of capital from Africa into the hands of Europeans was just tremendous over time! But this was a little more painful because it was slow and surreptitious. Versus the Yap Islander situation that was small and quick so that it was able to sort itself out. This one was much more of a parasitic long term relationship where it wasn\u2019t evident to African traders what was happening! They were just getting impoverished slowly over time as a result of this relationship. And the net outcome of that was impoverished Africans. Slavery was already practiced in Africa, so eventually they started selling slaves to Europeans, they started selling one another, family members, everything. And this catalyzed the trans-Atlantic slave trade. So the point here is that it\u2019s not just a metaphor to say that stealing money is stealing human time. It\u2019s not just a metaphor! It directly contributes in this instance\u2014the stealing of human time through compromising the money supply directly contributed to the direct theft of human time in the form of slavery. And the trans-Atlantic slave trade was just an atrocious thing! It was 365 years, 12.5 million lives stolen directly from African shores shipped to Europe and the America, 2 million of those died in transit in the infamous Middle Passage. It still has effects in the United States and Europe today. Not only were those lives stolen directly, but their children were born into slavery, this led to the Civil Rights movement in the 60\u2019s, all of these cascading socioeconomic consequences were rooted in [inaudible 47:13]. So the big argument there is an exclusive privilege to produce money without accountability to market forces is an apparatus of enslavement, and that\u2019s exactly what central banking is. They are counterfeiting currency to the benefit of their own shareholders at the expense of everyone else. So my argument there is central banking is the black corps in the world today that leads us towards more totalitarian government, and ultimately we\u2019ll see situations like we saw in Soviet Russia at some point if it goes unchecked! So humanity has to wake up to this truth! We cannot keep enslaving one another and counterfeiting currency which leads to enslavement, and hope to build a sustainable civilization \u2014 it\u2019s just not possible!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [48:06]: Right. I\u2019d like to stack some numbers up side by side. You touched on it a little bit before, but it\u2019s like, the Trans-Atlantic slave trade \u2014 and I hate to break down these calculations into time and economics, but I think it\u2019s important to benchmark things \u2014 6.8 billion hours of human time per year was stolen over 365 years. You\u2019re talking about 2.5 trillion hours of time stolen! Not even including the progeny, the people that died. And you think about Harold and Louis, and each one of those individuals could have been a Louis, and could have been part of building a dynasty or some sort of citadel for their family or foundation or prosperity. And that was taken away. And then you see even more egregious scenarios where you have these unfair fights where now you move from aggry beads to cloth strips. I think it\u2019s Portugal, is fabricating and counterfeiting cloth strips which are money in parts of Africa, they\u2019re buying slaves with the fabricated cloth strips \u2014 some of these slaves happened to be weavers of cloth strips! Now indentured slaves are brought to Portugal, where they\u2019re now building an economy around taking indentured slaves and having them produce the counterfeit goods that are then enslaving their own people. And it just cycles through! I\u2019d be curious to hear how that benchmarks against 40 years of being off of the gold standard? And I think that these are really big connections! You said something earlier before where \u2014 and I slightly disagree with you in terms of like, People are listening or learning \u2014 I\u2019m not convinced that this is getting through to the masses \u2014 all of these examples! That\u2019s why I really beat them! I want to highlight them! Because they\u2019re not taught in school, they\u2019re not even taught in higher education and universities \u2014 the history of money and how we chose gold, and what makes good money. It\u2019s interesting though because you can see signs that people understand this over time. You have music like in 1971 you have Marvin Gaye, Inner City Blues, talking about inflation, but it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s getting through or that this kind of ethos is really connecting with people! Even now Bitcoin is accelerating and more people are asking me about it in a positive light, but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re connecting aggry beads and fiat! But if we could just benchmark a little bit of how you see the time theft through fiat money printing. And the lenses there is that, if you can make glass beads for essentially free, if you can make cloth for free, and if you could make money for free, what does that mean? And then just kind of benchmark it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [51:23]: Yeah! One way to think about it is the exchange value of money will converge to its production cost over time. So if it only costs you next to nothing to make a cloth strip or a glass bead, there\u2019s an incentive to spend that money buying goods and services until market exchange value reaches production cost \u2014 until you\u2019ve inflated it down to its production cost. And that also explains the incentive scheme behind fiat currency. It\u2019s literally a keystroke in a centralized ledger. We say printing money often, but they don\u2019t even print money as much as they used to! It\u2019s more about a keystroke of entering new reserves into a bank balance is pyramided on top of to increase the money supply. So I quantify the Trans-Atlantic slave trade to benchmark the Fed against just the US central bank \u2014 not looking at the other central banks around the world. And you can develop a proxy for the amount of time stolen from the productive economy through quantitative easing, or money printing. And the data I used to do this were the average hourly wage rate per year \u2014 this is from the Social Security Administration in the US \u2014 I looked at the changes in US M2, which is the money supply year over year in the US. You can then divide that change \u2014 that increase in the money supply \u2014 divided by the average hourly wage rate. It gives you a proxy for how many hours were stolen. That\u2019s basically: What is the market rate per hour of the average worker? How much money did the government print that year? That\u2019s how many hours were stolen, because when a government prints money, there\u2019s no fair trade there. They\u2019re not adding any productive assets into the economy. They\u2019re not putting any assets in, they\u2019re not adding any human time, no ingenuity \u2014 nothing. It\u2019s just a reallocation on the claims of the productive factors in an economy from the hands of one to another. From the hands of society to the hands of the government, or the central bank you could say more specifically. And when you stack this over \u2014 I only looked back 40 years, 1981\u20132020 \u2014 the average hours stolen per year by just the US central bank, the Fed, came out to 23.4 billion hours per year stolen for 40 years straight! So this was two and a third as many as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, 6.5 billion hours per year. I guess it\u2019s closer to four times, actually! Three to four times more hours stolen per year than the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. And over the course of 40 years, the total calculus came out to almost 1 trillion human hours stolen by the Fed in 40 years of money printing. And then if you quantify that back to the workforce number, it\u2019s as if the Fed had a slave force of about 11.7 million people for 40 years straight, breaking down the hours to the number of people needed to satisfy those hours. For a long time I took a great deal of reticence to talk about central banking in this way, because it is distinctly different from physical bondage, where there are chains and whips and violence that\u2019s very visceral and real. Inflationary monetary policy driven by central banks is something much less visible than that, much harder to identify, but because of that invisibility, the tradeoff is that it\u2019s done at a much larger scale! It\u2019s three to four times as much as the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, looking at just one central bank! So it\u2019s bad! What else can you call systemic time theft other than slavery? When you look at it through this lens I think it gives you a frame of reference on what\u2019s truly wrong in the world today! We have theft at a minimum, slavery at a maximum, integrated directly into the prevailing economic order. And it may sound crazy, it may sound tinfoil hat, but just a quick study of the history of humanity \u2014 we\u2019ve always had systems of slavery, always! \u2014 every civilization has enslaved someone else. It\u2019s been the norm \u2014 the vast majority have used slaves. We\u2019ve just figured out a way to really scale it and hide it in a more sophisticated way than we\u2019ve ever done before, in the institution of central banking."}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [56:46]: Yeah. I agree with everything you\u2019ve just said, and I really agree with what you said about, When you come to this idea at first it\u2019s really hard to grok. It\u2019s really hard to accept. And I think part of that to be honest is, one of your quotes \u2014 I think you maybe said it on Stephan Livera \u2014 Acquire human labor on the market at an unfair price. That\u2019s a really interesting way to put it! I think what makes that really hard to grok is that, one, what make it really hard to grok at first in 2019 was, I\u2019m a huge benefactor I believe of this sin or this scam or this heist! And I\u2019m not incentivized \u2014 I wasn\u2019t incentivized in 2019 in my mind to do anything about it! I was a big beneficiary of it. I don\u2019t philosophically. I don\u2019t mean from justice. I wasn\u2019t for it, but it wasn\u2019t really in my best interest to find this as a truth! And it was shocking! And in the two years since, I now feel like what used to be an exported heist is now turned inward. Because we can no longer take advantage of what\u2019s going on outside of our borders to the degree that we have, both through physical force and through fiat central banking human ranching or farming. Now I feel that it\u2019s turned inward, and that\u2019s where I think it really started to click at a deeper level. One of the things you say is, More accurately, money, along with its precursors, action and speech, are the root of all sovereignty. So do you think we\u2019re fully sovereign in the US?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [58:49]: No, of course not! I mean, if you were sovereign you\u2019d be free to choose your own money!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [58:55]: Well to some extent we are!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [58:58]: No you can\u2019t! Try to go launch a competing business to the US dollar and see what happens!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman: Fair enough! So it\u2019s not a free market.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove: And it goes further than that! What about your tax rate? Do you feel like the services you\u2019re being rendered for the taxes you pay are satisfactory? Can you negotiate that tax rate?"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [59:20]: Yeah. And this is where it\u2019s not an opt-in voluntary system. I didn\u2019t agree to any of this! That\u2019s another one where it\u2019s really been an arc for me where I\u2019ve looked at taxes very differently over coming into Bitcoin and now where I stand. But like going to the dock and trying to launch my boat \u2014 I don\u2019t have a boat but as an example \u2014 that costs a fee. And you get into the discussion of, This is public land, the people\u2019s land, the public property. Why does it cost me something to do everything? But they felt more benign than insidious. Or I just didn\u2019t feel them as much, I didn\u2019t think about it as much. Now, with even more restrictions, and I have more time to think about these things, I don\u2019t think people are really \u2014 I don\u2019t see money still being a big part of this conversation in 2020!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:00:29]: Well, I agree that the political puppetry is still being executed successfully, right? They\u2019re distracting people, people are still caught up in this hallucination that it\u2019s red versus blue, conservative versus liberal, when in fact they all serve the central bank master! But I would argue that I\u2019m less concerned about \u2014 I mean clearly it would be great to wake people up immediately, but these things take time. So the way I see things playing out is: the more money is printed, the more abusive the system becomes, the more demand will be driven for encryption technologies, self-sovereign solutions, Bitcoin, frankly \u2014 people want to store their wealth in a place it cannot be confiscated, manipulated, abused, inflated. And the experience that I\u2019ve gone through falling into the Bitcoin rabbit hole: where your money goes your mind follows \u2014 as with the experience you\u2019ve gone through \u2014 it changes people over time. So my longer term vision and bet is that over the next 10, 20, 30 years, you\u2019re gonna have a massive awakening that the state is just a giant scam! It\u2019s a huge fraudulent organization. It abuses people. And now people have this ability to fight back in an unprecedented way with digital technologies: they can self-organize, you can move your capital in a system parallel to a legacy financial system, you can escape capital controls, you can do all \u2014 so that gets into the whole Sovereign Individual thesis, which I always mention this book. I\u2019m writing an essay series on it now, it\u2019s gonna be a 12-part series more or less covering one part per chapter in the book, plus one extra part covering Bitcoin specifically. I\u2019m arguing that we\u2019re transcending this false statist dichotomy between capitalism and communism, and that Bitcoin enables a new mode of socioeconomic organization I\u2019m calling Sovereignism. And that encryption technology \u2014 which is at the heart of the Internet, Bitcoin, and other tools that I think we\u2019ll see coming down the pipe in the coming years, this is inherently disruptive to the state. It gives people a level of sovereignty that\u2019s never before been possible! We needed a large monopoly on violence to preserve the peace and protect property rights in a trading economy before, but now a lot of these functions that the state was necessary for in the analog stages can be satisfactorily provided by software in the digital age. So we\u2019re in a Renaissance, really. The transition from the agricultural age into the industrial age or the fall of the feudal age \u2014 these things in retrospect they\u2019re major transitions, but no one saw them coming! If you\u2019re living in feudal society, you just think this is just the world, and the way it\u2019s just gonna be forever. The printing press is invented\u201410 million books are printed in a year. [inaudible] These ages are getting shorter and shorter. Agricultural age is much longer than the industrial age, the industrial age is much longer than the information age that we\u2019re moving into. Technology, as its innovation cycles accelerate, our organizational cycles accelerate, because society is a reflection of the technologies used to facilitate it! So we\u2019ve moved from large scale industrial tech, which necessitated a large scale nation state, to small scale microprocessing and digital technology, which will enable small scale self-organization. Who knows where this goes! But I think it\u2019s abundantly clear by this point that digital changes everything! Software is eating the world, and government is not immune to that!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:04:57]: When I think about when your time through money is stolen, it\u2019s in perpetuity on one end, where that life has lost its potential for prosperity, but it\u2019s in perpetuity on the other end, where if I were to steal someone\u2019s time, and then put my child through Harvard or other accredited programs and get them networks and connections, then my progeny can do better in perpetuity forever through that stolen wealth and time. And that really informs a lot of my thinking around fairness and justice and altruism, and how I try to make my decisions and always try to err on the side of being objective and doing what I think is best for myself but without trying to discount how my actions might affect others. And one more example I want to bring up from your early work is the example of the wine maker. And what inflation does to a small business person. And the choices they have to make at that micro-level, in dealing with inflation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:06:20]: Yeah this is a really interesting one. One way to think about prices is as an element that determines where attention is warranted. So if the price if something is increasing, that represents an unsatisfied want in the market economy \u2014 there is more demand than there is supply for this good or service. And so by extension, Bitcoin is a clear example of this. When a price of something goes up, attention is drawn to is. People pay attention to price changes. And you could say that the element for drawing attention is that the demand is outstripping supply, so there\u2019s an unsatisfied want there. So this draws the attention of producers in the marketplace to go and try to solve that want. The opposite would also be true, that if the price is declining, it\u2019s sort of descending away, it\u2019s getting less attention. It would indicate that a want is being satisfied more efficiently and effectively, and producers or entrepreneurs would pay less than that. Again in terms of the connection between price and attention, Bitcoin\u2019s a great example of that. Every time the price goes up or down, that\u2019s when it gets attention or less attention. So in that way, centralized bodies producing money, they\u2019re inflating the nominal price of assets or goods or everything, right? There\u2019s more dollars. The example that I gave is a wine maker operating in a central banking economy, who essentially faces three courses of action when a central bank prints money. The assumption is that he\u2019s selling his wine for $20 a bottle to begin with, so he knows that, Okay, say the central bank doubled the money supply, just assume inflation is even \u2014 it\u2019s not actually even in the world but for simplicity\u2019s sake \u2014 assume that his inputs are gonna effectively double in price. He has three choices: He can continue selling his wine for $20 a bottle and eat the loss \u2014 his cost of inputs has doubled but he keeps his price the same \u2014 he eats the loss due to inflation, he can choose to double the price of his wine to $40 a bottle, which will keep his margin constant \u2014 so the cost of inputs has doubled, he doubles his selling price, his margin is constant \u2014 or, he could water down his wine, or use cheaper ingredients, a lower quality products but he keeps selling it at $20 a bottle to preserve some of that margin. So faced with those three options, clearly he\u2019s not gonna take the loss. If he increases his price to $40 a bottle which would be the honest thing to do frankly, he is creating more attention, right? He\u2019s increased the price of wine, so he\u2019s drawing more attention from competitors that will look to sell that bottle at a higher price as well, and then those competitors might not be as honest as him! They may choose to sell the wine at a higher price or even a lower price and compromise on quality, so he\u2019s left with kind of this third choice, because even if he\u2019s honest he\u2019s probably gonna lose some business to competitors \u2014 because he\u2019s had to increase his price by double\u2014and then his competitors can hide some of that cost through again, cheaper lower quality ingredients. So he\u2019s sort of incentivized to deceive his customers in the short run! Now over time this would work itself out because his reputation \u2014 say he would have a reputation for a certain quality of wine \u2014 he would then be diminishing that quality which over time his reputation would be diminished as well. But it would take time for this to occur. So the moral of the story is: inflation is forcing producers to be more short term oriented. Again in raising their time preference. Which also encourages them to deceive their customers in the short run. They\u2019re thinking less about their long term reputation, more about their immediate financial profitability. And as a result of theft integrated in the money supply, inflation integrated directly into the money supply, producers of all sorts are forced to weigh their moral and financial [costs] in this way, they\u2019re gonna have to hold each one in each hand and decide, Am I gonna put food on the table and a roof over my head for my family, or am I gonna compromise a little bit [to run a better] business? So it\u2019s that mode by which I argue inflation is a cancer on the socioeconomic and moral fabric of reality. And again if civilization is [characterized] by the lowering of its time preference and the broadening of its time horizons, inflation is causing us to become less civilized, more deceptive, more short term oriented in general. And I think you can see this again back to https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/ inflation screws up society really bad!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:12:09]: Right. It\u2019s corrosive! And it pits us against each other, instead of having us collaborate for the sake of prosperity for all, as whimsical as that sounds! I\u2019m kind of curious what you think of stacking up \u2014 I think it\u2019s Ray Dalio\u2019s how the economy works in 80-year credit cycles, with the Fourth Turning and Brandon Quittem\u2019s take on that, and how those pieces work up against each other?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:12:38]: Yeah I haven\u2019t read the Fourth Turning but Brandon\u2019s a good friend of mine so I\u2019ve read his piece on it which is really good \u2014 highly recommend that. And we\u2019ve had some discussions about it but I think it\u2019s really interesting that humanity is subject to these cycles that are \u2014 I mean I don\u2019t know where they come from, they\u2019re just these super-seasons almost, these 70-year turnings. And I don\u2019t know where they come from but I find it very interesting! Dalio\u2019s economic cycles are interesting too, but I would argue that a lot of them are driven by this vulnerability of money to be co-opted, to have its scarcity compromised, which incentivizes people to accumulate debt. If your money is losing money every year, then you\u2019re incentivized to take out debt in current dollars, and let the inflation diminish your real debt burden over time, so again it flips, it inverts the incentives of money, where typically the incentives of money are to create savings. Savings undergird investment, investment improves time preference. So we\u2019re actually thinking longer term, we\u2019re becoming more civilized. Fiat currency inverts that entire situation. And I think most of Dalio\u2019s work is focused on that aspect of money, that it\u2019s been repeatedly abused and pushed to be a more debt-based money over time, and then you get these huge inflationary booms, which is actually just a giant misallocation of capital. People are starting projects that they think they can profitably complete, but it\u2019s all a result of a distorted price signal, and then once reality comes into play, it collapses! So this is the Austrian business cycle theory, that fiat currency distorts price signals and exacerbates the boom and bust business cycle. And I think Dalio\u2019s work really just \u2014 without saying it \u2014 measures and focuses on that. Saying that fiat currency is disturbing the standard business cycle. Which the standard business cycle would just be, people are always gonna get hyped up, overexuberant about something and it\u2019s gonna get a correction. That\u2019s normal! Growth is inherently unstable. But fiat currency fuels that fire and exacerbates it tremendously!"}
{"prompt": "Cedric Youngelman [1:15:20]: I want to turn a little bit more to Bitcoin. And I want to ask you, do you think Bitcoin is the alchemist\u2019s vision? In terms of creating this indestructible, durable, divisible thing?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Robert Breedlove [1:15:39]: You know I will just say that that is probably the rabbit hole! Alchemy again back to moderns \u2014 we think that alchemy is a joke \u2014 it\u2019s a bunch of people that thought they could turn lead into gold and it never worked? Not at all what it was! It was basically the precursor to the Scientific Revolution. Carl Jung says that alchemy was the dream from which science was born. You know I\u2019ve only got like five minutes left here so I can\u2019t dive into it completely, but I\u2019ll say that I find it very interesting that the highest aim of alchemy was to develop or discover the incorruptible substance. And this substance was to serve as the antidote to tyranny in general. But we would say that most forms of tyranny are state-based at least in the modern age. And I find it very interesting, this connection! The other thing is people think it was about how to turn lead into gold? That was just the symbol of it, actually. To turn lead into gold was to eliminate impurities, to absolutely eliminate impurities, to uncorrupt matter. And in removing corruption from matter there was also this feedback with the soul, the spirit, the character of man. So it would actually be refining our own morality, character, uncorrupting ourselves as we pursued this decorruption of the world, if you will. Again the highest aim was the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, which the alchemists called the lapis philosophorum, it was the incorruptible substance they were seeking. And I find it very interesting the connection to Bitcoin that 21 million Bitcoin is the first incorruptible thing mankind has ever created! We\u2019ve created something that existed beyond our own reach. No one in the world, no entity, no individual, no government, no central bank, can change \u2014 thus far at least, 12 years into Bitcoin\u2019s life , $600 billion in market capitalization\u2014a civil war later, that was Bitcoin Cash it was a Bitcoin fork, there have been a number of attempts to co-opt Bitcoin, to increase supply, increase block size, etc. It\u2019s been hardened through hostility. Thus far it seems as though 21 million Bitcoin is the first incorruptible figure mankind has ever created. And by being incorruptible, the great promise of Bitcoin is to disrupt the greatest institution of tyranny in human history, which is the central bank! So we have an incorruptible substance in Bitcoin, we have an antidote for the corruption of central banking. And if you talk to Bitcoiners that have studied this thing deeply and are active with it intimately, it changes you! Bitcoin changes you! I don\u2019t know how to describe it specifically, everyone has their own flavor of experience of it, but the general theme is that you\u2019re more family focused, you\u2019re more community focused, you\u2019re more purpose driven, more focused on saving, less focused on spending, you\u2019re asking deeper questions, you\u2019re thinking about the world more. It really does have a tremendous impact on the character of those that go down this rabbit hole earnestly. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what it is: is Bitcoin the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, the lapis philosophorum, who knows? I mean this sounds extra crazy tinfoil hat, but I would just say go do the research yourself! Look into it! Most of my knowledge of alchemy came from Jordan Peterson\u2019s book Maps of Meaning, which is a tremendously difficult book but also a very worthwhile read. And we\u2019re existing in a time where ancient wisdom seems to be resurging in the digital age. We get people doing yoga, meditation, ayurvedic medicine, paleo diets, psychedelics like ayahuasca are becoming more important, Bitcoin you can even argue is a form of ancient wisdom in that it\u2019s Austrian economic money. Austrian economics is the ancient wisdom of economics! Whereas Keynesian economics is central bank propaganda, more or less. So maybe this alchemy thing coming back in the digital age too is part of that! I don\u2019t know, but I find it very fascinating!"}

And maybe to give listeners some context, especially the new ones \u2014 a lot of new people are getting into this space \u2014 the first stock to flow model was created in March 2019 and it was a time-series model, so it looked at the Bitcoin price and it looked at the stock to flow and measured to quantify scarcity and then there\u2019s a nice correlation between them. And you can extrapolate that into the future and you get to a value that was then quite conversatively estimated at $55,000 end of 2021. And it\u2019s later adusted with new data and other [coin?] correction to $100,000 USD at the end of 2021. So that\u2019s the first model \u2014 the original OG stock to flow model! Then a year later in April 2020 the S2FX model \u2014 the cross-asset model \u2014 was made, and it was basically not a time-series model anymore! So it was a model that also uses the same stock to flow measure for scarcity and looks at market values, but then, across different assets! So Bitcoin is one asset, and I divided four phases \u2014 four phase transitions within Bitcoin. But then it also includes in the model, in the data, and ultimately in the model parameters \u2014 the stock to flow and market value of other assets like gold, real estate, silver, diamonds \u2014 and that\u2019s what makes it very different from the stock to flow model originally, but also more robust if you ask me! The important thing is that price prediction for end of 2021 is also a bit higher \u2014 it\u2019s $288,000 as an average price in that specific four-year period. To be honest, I like both models \u2014 they\u2019re both my babies! But if I had to choose, I would choose the S2FX model, because it\u2019s not a time-series model so it\u2019s more robust. It\u2019s always better to have time out of the equation, because we\u2019ll get maybe into that later, but if you correlate to time-series, there is a big risk of correlation being spurious. And that risk is less if you don\u2019t have time series! The other big thing is that we can now interpolate instead of extrapolate! If you have a time-series model \u2014 it can be the number of transactions, it can be the time itself, it can be the number of Bitcoins in existence \u2014 then you don\u2019t know what the number of transactions in the future are, and to base the prediction on top of that is a risky thing! It\u2019s extrapolation \u2014 it\u2019s based on data that you don\u2019t have in your data set! But the S2FX model, we have gold being at a higher stock to flow, and real estate being at a higher stock to flow and higher value, so we can actually interpolate within the data that is used to fit the model, and that is a very, very strong argument for this S2FX model!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [08:19]: And so probably it\u2019s a good point also to discuss some of the critiques of some of the modeling. The thing is, it\u2019s kind of shifted over time, right? And I guess we\u2019re talking about both the different models, but with the S2F, one of the interesting developments was this idea of cointegration, which then later it seems that part has now been shown that we can apply the cointegration test. From your perspective, what does that mean? Does it essentially just mean we don\u2019t have the confidence that would have been provided by cointegration, but you believe that the model might still provide some high-level predictive power? Is that how you would summarize it? Or how would you summarize it?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [09:00]: A bit differently! By the way, I got a lot of critique on the models, which I also invited, because I think the models are only getting better if they\u2019re open sourced and discussed! And the point you mention about cointegration was one of the more interesting and very intelligent discussions! I liked that very much! It\u2019s important to know that it only applies to the first model \u2014 the time-series original S2F model \u2014 and not to the S2FX model. And what it basically does \u2014 it\u2019s a measure that gives you some certainty that it is not a spurious regression, not a spurious correlation. Because there\u2019s always a risk that you find correlation [but] that there is no causation or no relationship at all! It\u2019s just a fake, fake correlation \u2014 that\u2019s always a risk! And to be clear, that is still a risk! It could be, the relation between stock to flow, scarcity, and value, could be spurious\u2014although every day that seems less likely! It is important to make that point! Now with cointegration it\u2019s actually a test, and that test \u2014 if you apply it and it proves cointegration \u2014 then the less likely, it\u2019s not certain, but the less likely the relationship, the correlation, is spurious, is false. So there\u2019s a lot of probability that it\u2019s a causal relation and a correlation that you can use for making predictions! But the discussion was quite interesting because it was actually held with a Dutch guy, an Australian guy, a German guy, and me! There were four people working on the same data and the same test. And first we all did the same test and the test clearly showed cointegration! And cointegration means that the series stick together very closely. The story about the drunk and the dog was made. The drunk goes on the street to walk his dog, the dog is on the lease, the drunk goes everywhere, the dog goes everywhere, but the distance between the drunk and the dog can never be longer than the leash! And that\u2019s what you measure \u2014 the leash! They always stick together, and actually that\u2019s what you see in the data! If you look at the Bitcoin price, it sticks to the model, it tracks the model really really close! And if you do the test, you also measure there is cointegration. But then the German guy said, Well, one of the assumptions of the test is that both variables are stochastic and not deterministic, so they should be random and not predetermined. And of course, stock to flow is predetermined! So we couldn\u2019t apply the test! So although the test showed cointegration, theoretically and practically we cannot use it! But it clearly shows the moving of the price around the model. The test also shows it, but we cannot use it! Yeah, that was the end of it right there! You could say, Okay, we should use another test, or develop another test, because it clearly sticks to the model\u2014the price. But on the other hand, it\u2019s maybe best to be conservative and say that there is no cointegration and probably the relationship is spurious! So, that was the end of that discussion! On the other hand, if there\u2019s no cointegration, it doesn\u2019t mean there is no correlation. And the cointegration only works on the time-series model \u2014 so the original S2F model. By the time the discussion was at its peak, I introduced the other model, the S2FX model, and there of course you see an even higher R2, and even higher correlation, and we cannot apply the cointegration test over there. Yeah, that was a very interesting discussion at the time!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [12:57]: One other interesting critique that I have seen in terms of the \u2014 so now we\u2019re talking about the cross-asset model, the S2FX model \u2014 is this idea that the S2F multiples of different assets, like if there\u2019s a variant in one of the variables that goes into it, I think the argument is essentially that the S2F variable dominates that calculation, and then that is what\u2019s driving a high R2. How would you think about that kind of issue?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [13:26]: I think that\u2019s true. We actually did some tests in the S2FX model but also for the S2F model, to include other input variables next to stock to flow. For example, the number of transactions over the time, or other variables. And it clearly shows what you already said, that whatever you input into the model, the stock to flow is the main and dominant force driving the price! That\u2019s the case with both models.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [13:58]: Yeah I see. That would just be a difficult thing if you were gonna try to run that on other assets, because we can see that with Bitcoin, but if were gonna try to run those other \u2014 not the price calculation, but with other things \u2014 on gold and property, that\u2019s kind of a harder thing to do! Theoretically some of those numbers might be possible to create though, right?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [14:18]: Well there\u2019s different aspects. If you do it on other coins for example you find no correlation between stock to flow and price. You actually find cointegration and correlation with the price of those altcoins and the price of Bitcoin, but not between their own stock to flow and the price of those altcoins. If you look at gold and silver and other assets, there are not much assets with a large stock to flow! With a stock to flow larger than, say, 2. There\u2019s really not much there: silver, gold, diamonds, real estate, maybe art. Art is a $2-$3 Trillion market but I don\u2019t have the data for that! I would be very happy to analyze if somebody has the data. But that\u2019s about it I guess. For example if you look at gold, gold over the same period that we have the Bitcoin data, since 2009 \u2014 if we look at the stock to flow of gold and the market cap of gold, it sort of stays the same! It\u2019s very stable and I plotted it in some of the charts. The amount of movement in stock to flow of gold and the market price of gold is \u2014 if you plot it, it\u2019s really stable! It\u2019s remarkable!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [15:39]: Yeah! And I think you\u2019ve also been Tweeting out recently just under a month ago, you were saying, RIP to the idea of lengthening cycles and diminishing returns. So why was that?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [15:53]: Yeah that\u2019s one of the models that\u2019s out there, and actually it\u2019s a model I looked at before I had the S2F. It\u2019s basically the time model that a lot of guys are using, and that is I think for the first time used and published by Trolololo in 2014. It has this nice curve and it fits the price of Bitcoin very well! But it tends to be not that stable. It tends to be\u2014 you have to adjust it every year to keep it fitted to the data. So the time model is there but it\u2019s also underestimating it a little bit, and it doesn\u2019t of course give credence to the step function that you see in the Bitcoin price. And that occurs after the halving! So if you use the time model, it\u2019s the first crude indication and we\u2019ve all seen those charts, but it doesn\u2019t give any weight to the halvings and the very clear timing of price rise that you can see in the Bitcoin price that is around a year, one-and-a-half years after the halvings. It\u2019s a nice model, but it\u2019s maybe a starting point but not a robust one. And while we\u2019re at it, I think it also underestimates it a little bit, because if you look at the S2FX model, you can clearly see that last period, the last couple of years, the Bitcoin price was a little bit underperforming to that model. So the phase if you will \u2014 the last four years \u2014 was lower than the model predicted! And that might be due to COVID, the last part of that four-year period was kind of low, but if you use only that data \u2014 the time series data \u2014 to fit the curves, then it must be a little bit lower, it must track that lower data in the last couple of months! The other thing, actually the main reason why I said the lengthening cycles and the lower cycle theory is dead \u2014 if you track the prices without the model, just looking at the data, you compare it to what happened after the 2016 halving and what happened after the 2012 halving, you see that the price now is right in the middle of those two historic tracks. And the diminishing cycle return theory says that it has to be lower. It states that the next peak will be later and lower than the last \u2014 well if you look at it right now it\u2019s obviously not the case! It\u2019s a bit early to call I should say, but we\u2019re smack in the middle of the last two! So yeah, it doesn\u2019t look that way!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [18:51]: Right. So I guess to clarify, that would mean that the diminishing idea is more like the cycle top would be less as a multiple than last time."}
{"prompt": "PlanB [19:05]: Yes and the current price would be much lower than it is right now!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: I see. Yeah. And if we compare something like the S2F and one of the Twitter bots by our friend Bitstein\u2014he\u2019s got the S2F Multiple and he\u2019s got a really interesting chart where he\u2019s basically showing the actual price versus the model price. And right now we\u2019re above the model price. It\u2019s like $36,000 versus the model price right now is around $28,000-$29,000. So what\u2019s your view on that idea? Even though we don\u2019t have cointegration and that\u2019s not part of it anymore \u2014 it\u2019s just interesting to a person looking at that chart, that you think, Okay, it\u2019s really interesting that it\u2019s staying inside that range! One critique that someone might be thinking is, Well hold on! These guys with their charting and modeling, they keep changing the day and now it\u2019s 463 days and so on! How would you think about that particular issue?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [20:09]: Yeah the 463 days is a nice thing, I\u2019ll get to that later! But first of all, the fact that the price tracks the model so well it\u2019s actually magical to see! Also for me! You make the model, you hope it will be right, but of course the proof is in the pudding, and now we see it happening. So it\u2019s really magical to see it, I\u2019m very happy about that. And we have to see whether it goes to the $100k or the $288k, but I\u2019m quite optimistic about the $288k. That would be my target! About the 463 days, that\u2019s actually an improvement that was suggested by Preston [Pysh]. Preston and I discuss the models a lot, and also that site digitalik.net, and you mentioned the Bitstein bot \u2014 it is a beautiful thing! And digitalik has also real-time charts on his website. Well Preston said \u2014 you\u2019d have to ask him himself because he can tell it much better than I! \u2014 but he said, Okay I see what you did there. You tried to keep the model as simple as possible, only to have the stock to flow as an input, but we also see from the last two halvings that the price effect kicked in later. So there was a time lag in price going up after the halving, and we can model that if just very roughly look at the last two halvings. We see that the all-time high after the 2012 halving was about 13 months after the halving, and for the 2016 halving that was about 17 months after the halving! So on average there\u2019s 15 months from the halving to the all-time high, and if you multiply that by the number of days in a month which is 30.5, you get very close to that 463 number, and that\u2019s how you calculate it! And when you use that number the fit will be even better than if you use only the stock to flow variable, because you now have adjusted the average to stock to flow over those 463 days. Yeah I think that\u2019s a very nice addition and it tracks even better!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [23:05]: Yeah I certainly think it\u2019s really interesting that when you look at this chart that it just seems to stay within these blue bands. There are times when it goes outside the dark blue bands but it\u2019s still inside the light blue bands. It\u2019s just an interesting chart to look at, but I guess at any point it depends how bullish we are on Bitcoin. Obviously all of us are, we\u2019re all bullish on Bitcoin! I wonder, because we really don\u2019t know when any of these things break down, right? And when I say break down, I mean break to the upside! It may just be that enough people around the world wake up to Bitcoin, start buying it, and then just completely destroy all the models and just completely blast through, right? And this would be more like \u2014 as I was discussing with Preston \u2014 the idea of the final cycle. So I wonder, as you look at the landscape, what\u2019s your thoughts on that idea of, Okay, are people just gonna start front-running the future cycles and just buy it all now? Are we going to a final cycle? Or, the counter-argument might be something like, Well see, there\u2019s just not that many people who are woken up to Bitcoin and putting in enough of their portfolio into buying Bitcoin! So it just can\u2019t reflect yet!"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [24:27]: Yeah! Well that\u2019s a very interesting discussion! I think we\u2019ll be having that exact discussion for the next 12\u201318 months at least! It touches on a lot of interesting aspects \u2014 this final cycle discussion. And let me mention a few: one is the efficient market hpothesis, which was also one of the critiques on my model. Nic Carter wrote a nice piece about it. The efficient market hypothesis says that all the information that\u2019s publically available should be reflected in the prices of the assets. Stock to flow is publically available, the model is publically available, it should not be so easy to make money as just to buy Bitcoin now, follow the model and be rich! That model cannot be! On the other hand, and then we come to this front-run argument: if now we see that the model does work, regardless of the efficient market hypothesis, it does work and it goes to $288k, what happens then? Will people when front-run the next cycle? Because for the next cycle the model predicts a price that\u2019s far above $1 million per Bitcoin! So will investors then price that cycle in as well? And the efficient market hypothesis says that they will, because the information is out there, we\u2019ve seen that it works, and if everybody thinks that it works then it would be the rational thing to do! On the other hand, I don\u2019t know! I had that same question when the price shot up after publishing the article in 2019, but that turned out to be too early, because the price went down aftwards. But we had that exact same discussion back then! And just like back then, I think we will not have a final cycle now, and we will not see front-running \u2014 we will see some front-running, and some FOMO if you will after $288k \u2014 so the price will probably go much higher, maybe to a half-million at the all-time high, but I think the other important aspect is risk, and that was my counter-argument at the time against the efficient market hypothesis, that critique as well. And I wrote an article about that. Yes, the model is out there, yes all the information is out there and it shouldn\u2019t be as easy as it seems to be now to make money \u2014 just buy Bitcoin and follow the model and be rich \u2014 on the other hand there\u2019s perceived risks and real risks in the market. I did a poll on that! And the number one risk that people see is governments banning Bitcoin! And we see a lot of actions in that direction! We see US Treasury minister announcing draconian laws over Christmas with a process that\u2019s not very democratic, so they\u2019re really trying to kill it! And we see today, like [inaudible from inaudible 27:56] warning about regulation that has to be made against Bitcoin, although regulation of course is not a ban, well it could be good or bad, but it\u2019s a big risk! And people see it as a big risk, and governments have barely woken up to the possibility that Bitcoin could be a $1 Trillion, let alone a $10 Trillion market, so when that happens, they will move! And that could be a good thing or a bad thing, but there is a risk! And another risk is quantum computing. They could break the private public key relationship. So all the experts say it\u2019s not possible and it\u2019s not possible for at least ten years and there may be adjustments to the software, etc., but still it is a risk. And I think those risks whether true or not will surface again, especially after the FOMO phase, after we hit the stock to flow target models and maybe beyond. There will be risks, and there will be black swan events that make those risks look very real! We will go down again. So I surely think that that will happen, and also that\u2019s another argument \u2014 human nature! Greed and fear! It will stay the same. So yeah we probably will have FOMO once we go up and go beyond $100,000, and we go too high because of greed! And then some risk will surface and people will be so fearful and they\u2019ll estimate the risks too high and price will go down. I think that will stay the same. Having said that, the third discussion we\u2019ll touch \u2014 it\u2019s the topic of hyperbitcoinization! All Bitcoiners know what it is, but it basically means that Bitcoin goes to the moon. That it will become a unit of account, and that maybe the Dollar dies. And Bitcoin will be the thing that we all use to pay and to save money. Yeah, when that happens, that would be the final cycle, but it would be more of a final cycle for the dollar in my opinion than for Bitcoin! So it will be the moment that the Dollar will end, to exist as the global currency. And I don\u2019t think that will be this phase, the phase 5 if you will, but the phase after phase 5, when Bitcoin will reach a market cap of somewhere in the neighborhood of real estate \u2014 let\u2019s say $100 Trillion USD. I like that number for some reason!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [31:14]: Ah yeah, I wonder why! So just looking at the OG S2F model, it seems to me that that model predicts the price for $100k for this round, and I think it\u2019s something like $300k or so for the next round in 2024-2025 cycle. And then the 2028\u20132029 halving and bull run I think it\u2019s predicting something in the millions! I mean really if we were gonna talk about final cycle I think to me it makes more sense that 2029 might be the final cycle. But things can change, but that\u2019s one way to look at it if you\u2019re looking at the S2F model."}
{"prompt": "PlanB [31:56]: Yes. That\u2019s true. So it will be the next cycle after 2024, more in the 2026\u20132028 area. But then again, there will always be risk, greed, and fear. A total elimination of the cycle \u2014 I don\u2019t know! Hyperbitcoinization, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing to look at, but it will be very interesting. And the front-running also, I don\u2019t know! For sure if we reach even the $100,000 level, people will think, Whoa! Well it might go to a million I better buy some. Well maybe it goes down but I\u2019ll wait a couple of years! It will be really really interesting how that plays out, how that dynamic goes from here.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [32:42]: Yeah and I think having that regular stacking dollar cost averaging or order stacking group of people out there \u2014 those people are in some sense holding up the floor, because after every dip, these are the people running in and either they are manually buying the dip or their automated buys are kicking in, and that\u2019s in some sense raising the price floor over time."}
{"prompt": "PlanB: Yeah true that. The DCA\u2019ers, the retail investors of course. Maybe that\u2019s not the biggest driver at the moment. The three big buyers at the moment: Greyscale, who buys everyday more Bitcoins than are mined. Paypal \u2014 same thing. Cashapp. So those three buyers buy each along everyday more Bitcoin than there are made so they have to bid the prices from people who hold them. But as we\u2019ve seen, most of the weak hands have already been shaken out by the volatility, so the hands holding the Bitcoin right now are stronger as ever! I mean if I look at my own coins, I\u2019m not gonna sell, never! Ever! But to the next person who wants to sell, but you don\u2019t get my coins. And they will be harder to get. And it\u2019s really funny, I can see that on the on-chain data as well. The fact that there\u2019s not much coins. And I don\u2019t mean the balances on the exchanges that are Tweeted about and looked at. I mean really the on-chain data, it shows a pattern that is very consistent with the stock to flow model and the four-year cycle, and it shows a shortage that is scary actually! The price has only one way to go in my opinion.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [34:14]: Yeah for example my sponsor Unchained Capital they have some really interesting work, the HODL waves chart. Which gives you a nice indicator of waves of HODLing and how long some people have been HODLing their coins. Because there\u2019s people out there that have been HODLing for multiple cycles at this point. You make that point and it\u2019s a good point about how you add across Greyscale and Cashapp and Paypal and others \u2014 that\u2019s buying more coins each day than are issued by the miners each day. But then I guess the other part of it is old HODLers, because eventually at some price they might say, Okay I want to take some out and buy a house and buy a car, because obviously yes Bitcoin is going up but I need to live, I need to look after my family, I have living costs. Maybe that will become a more dominating factor of just how many people are willing to offload, even if it\u2019s a small portion aggregated across millions of millions of HODLers. That small portion can add up to a new amount of supply hitting the market in terms of the sale of Bitcoin."}
{"prompt": "PlanB [35:24]: Yeah I think that\u2019s a key thing that you described there. And the HODL wave chart is one that has inspired me since the very beginning to do on-chain analysis and look at the data. If the listeners don\u2019t know what we were talking about, Google it, look it up in Twitter and find that chart! The HODL waves\u2019 basis is really an intriguing way of looking at Bitcoin! I make the HODL charts myself. If you run a full node you have all the data, so if you can do a little bit of programming in Python you can make them yourselves, and you can go a lot deeper than that as well. For example the UTXO set, the total amount of coins in the transactions that are unspent out that \u2014 that changes over time, which is sort of the HODL waves in one dimension. That gives a treasure of information about how those coins move, who is selling, and it\u2019s really unique to Bitcoin as well, because in bank data you don\u2019t have that! You would have to have access to all the banks\u2019 databases. With Bitcoin for the first time you have that! It\u2019s like a heaven for quants, it\u2019s like a heaven for people who like to make new economic theories about how this works \u2014 this supply and demand game in Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [36:42]: Right and there are providers as well who do some of the things. I know Coinmetrics do some related analysis and also Glassnode. For listeners I have an interview with Rafael Schultze-Kraft, he\u2019s from Glassnode he\u2019s the CEO. And we spoke about these statistics as well. One interesting one is looking at, of all the unspent transaction outputs, you can look at how many of them are sitting in a profit and how many of them are sitting in a loss position, and try to ascertain where the market is at from looking at those numbers. Looking more broadly at the macro world of all of this, what are some other relevant factors to think about? It seems every six months we get some drama about Tether, and, Oh my god, Tether is not backed and so on! What\u2019s your thoughts on all of that?"}

For years and years I\u2019ve heard that type of FUD, and it\u2019s at specific times, when the price is sort of wobbly and there\u2019s a lot of things going on such as with regulation at the moment, and all of a sudden \u2014 I get daily about 50 DMs in my Twitter of people, How about Tether? How about Tether? They put their comments under each one of my Tweets, and my impression is that it\u2019s like an army of FUDsters that try to spin a story, and of course it gets picked up by people without a brain! So yeah it\u2019s nothing! There was a podcast I don\u2019t know where it was but it was with the two guys from Tether last week \u2014 it was very good! They explained how it works and why Tether is there, because you know the banking system is very slow. If I transfer money to the US or to Australia it could easily take three days, where if I want to park some Bitcoin money in cash and use dollars for a couple of hours, that then would not be possible. So yeah you need a coin, a synthetic dollar where you can park your money that goes way faster than the old, slow, traditional banking system. And I get it! Of course how much the Tethers are backed by real dollars and other assets \u2014 that\u2019s an important thing and more transparency can be given there by Tether, but it\u2019s a very traditional issue as well with having collateral against loans and future markets that are fully collateralized every day. I guess for people who are not aware or not familiar with those collateral processes, that it sounds very opaque and mystique, and it\u2019s just stuff that you make a lot of FUD and conspiracies about, but for me it\u2019s a non-issue.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [41:20]: I think it\u2019s really interesting that a lot of people just latch onto an explanation and sometimes they can\u2019t find it in themselves to believe that Bitcoin is this genuinely new thing \u2014 it is a monetizing new asset! It\u2019s not some new little tulip bubble thing! And tulip bubbles don\u2019t last for twelve years and continually grow each time and have all this actual utility and networks growing around the people who really use it in the real world, right?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [41:51]: Yeah and maybe Stephan it is easy for us, both having a background in banking and institutional investing! But I mean, what I\u2019ve been seeing since 2008\u20132009 basically since Bitcoin was developed \u2014 since the global financial crisis \u2014 the amount of quantitative easing and the amount of money being printed by central banks what they have done the last years is so overwhelming, it\u2019s the only macroeconomic topic! It overarches everything! It\u2019s staggering really how much money has been printed and what it has been used for! And I\u2019ve been in a position where I have dealt with banks on a daily basis, from bank contacts, with Basel capital management requirements, from insurance contacts, solvency requirements \u2014 we\u2019ve been selling stuff to the central banks for years and years and years, and they buy everything! You know that famous scene in The Big Short where the crew is at a conference in Las Vegas about mortgages and mortgage securities \u2014 there\u2019s also conferences like that in Europe, actually the same organizers. And at those conferences \u2014 the central banks are there as well \u2014 everybody talks about the central banks because they\u2019re the biggest buyer out there! They buy everything! They have an unlimited budget! I think if you\u2019re in the trenches and you deal with the central banks and with quantitative easing no matter how you call it \u2014 it can and has become a semantics game lately\u2014 if you\u2019re in the trenches and doing this work, you see the absolute staggering obscenity of it, if you will! It really reminds me of Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany! We\u2019ll have to see, but knowing the quantitative easing and how it works, it\u2019s very helpful in making me a big believer in Bitcoin, I truly believe that!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [43:53]: In terms of comparing this Bitcoin bull run versus other Bitcoin bull runs, and I know you\u2019ve been charting them out and trying to show, Okay, if this were equivalized to the previous cycle, what would it look like? We\u2019re sort of tracking in the middle of the two other halving cycles?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [44:14]: Yes we have the two earlier cycles, which is not much, but we can compare. That was the 2017 cycle and the 2013 cycle, and they are quite different actually! 2013 was of course very early, and it was in a stage where mining was a big topic as well, because that was the year also that ASIC chips \u2014 mining chips \u2014 application specific integrated circuits, very specific mining chips were produced and made the security of the network like a million times bigger, and everybody that had that chip had an advantage. So there was huge optimism and excitement about this next step in the Bitcoin history, and price shot up from a low of $2.5, average $5 to $100 to $1,000 within one year! So that was really unimaginably fast, without much corrections in between as well! But then 2017 the mining technology was already done, there was a lot of improvement but not that big huge jump like in 2013. So the new thing and the excitement was all about altcoins and ICOs and forks. Everyone was dreaming about tokenized world and new coins and FinTech wave hit the markets! And that craze shot the price up from $200-$400 at the low to $20,000 at the high, so that was also very nice rise, but it had several corrections in between, like six or seven! Very different from 2013. It had six or seven corrections of about 30% in between in that big rise. So right now the big question is: correction or no correction? I guess part of the answer we already have because we just had a big correction when price shot up from $10,000 to $40,000 and then crashed to $30,000, which is -25% correction. But if you ask me it\u2019s very similar and maybe more similar to 2013 price-wise than 2017! So we might as well see not that much corrections on our way up! And that is also compatible with the macro environment that we see at the moment. We talked about that \u2014 the quantitative easing has gone full throttle of course since COVID, and more money has and will be made by central banks in the months to come than we have ever seen before. That money has to go somewhere! That goes to banks, that goes to companies that are saved that would have otherwise defaulted, and all the people, all the managers and employees of those companies, they can go on buying stuff which is a good thing of course, but it also keeps the economy going and in that way in a real sense that quantitative easing money \u2014 the printed money \u2014 enters the real economy! And it enters the real economy at the top first: managers, politicians, the people that are already rich. So what did they do with it? They buy assets: a second or third house, a street of houses, as an investment objective. They buy gold, they buy Bitcoin! And part of that you can quantify in the model, but part of that money will trickle down to assets and also to Bitcoin. But with the amount of money being printed, it\u2019s almost unimaginable that we go down from here or have very big corrections. And quite honestly you can see that in the prices too! The last three months, if there was a significant dip in the price, it got scooped up immediately by buyers! And Michael Saylor was very eloquent and very open in how he did it, how he bought his first $200 million and the other $400 million and the other buys since then. He does this very professionally with a lot of help from people that have the equipment and the access to the market, and they move that money without moving the price too much, in very small tranches. [49:00] Yeah I have the feeling that every dip, every time the price goes down, there is somebody with stronger hands that will say, Thank you very much for the coins, they will now end up in my wallet and they will go in deep cold storage, never to be seen again! Or at least in the next ten years! So yeah I think we\u2019re witnessing that right now! And it feels more like 2013 than 2017.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [49:27]: As we are entering this whole Phase 5 thinking, are there any other broader macro themes that you think are worth commenting on in terms of things like, What other kinds of entities we might see entering the space? What kind of vigor will they be entering the space with? Will they be cautiously dipping their toe in, or will they start to really dive in in a more deep way to Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "PlanB [50:02]: Two things I\u2019d like to say about that: one is the institutional investors are really lining up now to buy Bitcoin! I\u2019ve been invited almost weekly to join meetings with hedge funds, family offices, banks, insurance companies, to talk about Bitcoin, not only the stock to flow model, but just the whole Bitcoin thing and how you can buy it and how you can hedge it and how you have to look at it as an investor. So there\u2019s really a lot of demand from investors, and one of the things that I find very interesting\u2014also for myself \u2014 is the derivatives markets. So if you look at the futures market for example, you can now buy Bitcoin for, say, $35,000, and you can sell it at the same time for a year later \u2014 you can future sell it for more, I don\u2019t know what the price is, but $36,000. So you get a certain $1,000 profit, you only have to wait for a year! And of course you give up your upside and you also have no downside so there\u2019s really less risk, but you really have to know what you\u2019re doing. But anyway, if you do it like that\u2014it\u2019s a cash and carry strategy \u2014 you can make a 20% return annualized, and that is the kind of returns that Warren Buffett and famous hedge funds get! But not banks or insurance companies \u2014 they\u2019d be happy with maybe 5%. So 20% in an easy trade like that is something that cannot be ignored and is seen by more and more people, and some people pop their toes in the water and of course it works. It is too good to be true! And after that in a negative interest rate environment that I\u2019m living in in Europe, -0.6%, you can actually borrow money for negative interest rates if you\u2019re an institutional investor. But even as a private individual you can lend against your house for 1% or lend without collateral for 3%! Well if you use that money \u2014 and I\u2019m advising not to do that, but for professional investors this is candy that is too good to be true! And then if we look at option markets, we see implied volatilities of over 100%, which means there\u2019s call premiums from 40\u201350%. So you can do volatility harvesting strategies which are very very profitable and cannot be done on other asset markets! So the whole derivatives markets and the relation between the spot markets, derivatives markets, futures, options, etc., I\u2019ll be watching them like a hawk\u2014actually participating in them! I see a lot of people entering those trades and looking at it. I think the future and option market prices will give us a lot of information about the future, so it\u2019s really interesting if the base rates of the futures stay that high, if the implied volatilities in the options markets stay that high, and yeah so that\u2019s one thing that cannot be denied anymore by the more traditional investors and that will be seen by more and more. The other thing \u2014 it\u2019s not so much investing but more society thing \u2014 it\u2019s a very positive thing: good money, sound money is very important for humanity! It\u2019s good for trade, it\u2019s good for specialization, it\u2019s good for capital allocation and allocation of scarce resources, where the investors were not. And to have sound money, a measure, a unit of account that can be counted upon, it can be depended upon, is very interesting! And very important! And we don\u2019t have that at the moment, because central banks are printing the money at will, they\u2019re using it for political purposes, they\u2019re weaponizing it, and it\u2019s like an architect that uses a measure like the meter or an inch that changes every day! Imagine how a building like that looks after the architects are finished! And that\u2019s our economy at the moment! So we\u2019re building with a measure that is changed every day, and Bitcoin will \u2014 for the first time \u2014 introduce a constant. And that is the 21 million coins. So that will for the first time ever, be a constant in finance like there is a constant in physics \u2014 the speed of light, for example. In mathematics. So that is from an Austrian perspective and I talked about this with Saifedean lately. It could be very interesting, this constant! And maybe with that comes a sort of predictability, but at least a totally different kind of economy, separation of money and state, and in my opinion it will even unleash the next Renaissance with science at the very heart of it, but also with art and freedom and a totally different society than we have at the moment that is dominated by governments and states. And this one will be more sovereign individual and math and art-based! So yeah I find that a very hopeful perspective, and that\u2019s maybe, apart from the investing, the main reason why I find Bitcoin so very very interesting!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [56:05]: Yeah there\u2019s certainly a lot of factors in there that really point to being bullish at this point in time. And some of the earlier points you were just making there like the cash and carry strategy \u2014 now obviously for those of us who are more hardcore Bitcoiner, we wouldn\u2019t want to give up the upside of holding Bitcoin, but for somebody who\u2019s a little bit more trying to dip their toe in here, this is an easy way for that kind of person to \u2014 so long as they have the right institutional set-up to be able to achieve that kind of strategy. And I think the other point that you raised that\u2019s really interesting in terms of where the next big amount of demand or the next potential big markets of people who are gonna come into Bitcoin, is this whole cost of carry which we\u2019re seeing in Europe! People who have large amounts of fiat money in their bank accounts are now starting to get charged for that! And well, if we think from a cost of carry perspective, you can quite cheaply hold Bitcoin for a tiny tiny fraction of the cost that these people are paying to hold fiat money in a bank account, so I think that is just gonna really start driving home this cost of holding fiat. Whereas historically it was free \u2014 or you made money on it!"}
{"prompt": "PlanB: Oh absolutely! And for example in Holland it\u2019s not even small amounts, it\u2019s everything above 25,000 Euros you get negative interest! You don\u2019t get interest \u2014 you have to pay! I can tell you, the moment that that happens, that negative interest rate is unleashed upon your savings, then the demand for Bitcoin will skyrocket! I saw it happening around me with friends and family, I saw it at work, I saw it in the whole country! Everybody is scrambling to get their money out of this negative interest rate bullshit! It\u2019s really unimaginable what that does psychologically and of course it just eats your money away!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [58:10]: Yeah it\u2019s a very big injustice.

{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem: Thanks for having me! Looking forward to the conversation!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Definitely! I\u2019m kind of curious, just jumping back to your time at Oracle and selling enterprise software: what was that like, and what did you learn selling enterprise software that you kind of bring to the Bitcoin space? Or your outlook on economics, or how systems and networks work?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [01:27]: Yeah definitely! So I graduated college in 2010, and that was my first job out of school, was selling enterprise software. And I stayed there for about 4 years before leaving and doing other things, but my time there \u2014 a couple quick points: I would say the first thing that really threw me off was that Oracle is an IT company, right? They serve enterprise customers and they give them technology. And yet the internal technology at Oracle was garbage! So some of the sales reps were using Salesforce CRM tools to manage their own pipeline, even though Oracle had all kinds of CRM tools. And then you start calling on these large businesses\u2014like one of my accounts was Verizon for a long time. And you take a look at a company that you think has their stuff together, and yet they make horrible decisions managing their IT year-over-year: everything\u2019s abandoned, it\u2019s short term, and I was sort of disenchanted by the allure of these big companies and what they were meant to do. And if I go back a second, I felt at the time that my whole life was leading up to that, and going through business school and learning these things. And all of a sudden \u2014 you know, getting the job that I thought I wanted! And it just wasn\u2019t as fulfilling as I thought! I had a good time there, I paid off my student loans there, I met great people. The stress of a sales environment \u2014 I actually performed really well under that environment. I did well there! I just had the flash in my eye of, Is this the rest of my life? Is this what I\u2019m gonna be doing? That just wasn\u2019t good enough and so I took a little detour.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [03:05]: Yeah. You speak about the internal architecture at Oracle. And then maybe [with] your own internal software it seems like you rearchitected your life! You kind of rebuilt it from scratch. And went on a journey with your now wife. And you went \u2014 you didn\u2019t just get out of corporate world and just run \u2014 it seems like you went and joined communities and built things!"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [03:32]: Yeah that\u2019s right. What ended up happening was, I was being groomed for a promotion. I flew out to Denver to meet with a new team. And I sort of had this experience of, I don\u2019t want to become these people! It was just the classic sales reps: not polite to the server, infidelity runs rampant in the community, and just all around deeply unhappy people! And so\u2014I feel that I\u2019m susceptible to my environment as most people are, and I could just flash before my eye again realizing that I was going to become this. And so what ended up happening is I just hit pause, I went through a Yoga teacher training here in Minneapolis while staying full-time at Oracle. And I sort of had the viewpoint of: (1) my future life at Oracle as the trajectory shows, and then you have (2) this other community of people that are radically different! That process opened my eyes to, Okay, maybe I don\u2019t have to do the thing I thought I was meant to do! And it gave me the courage to try something different. And so what you\u2019re alluding to then is my wife and I quit our jobs \u2014 we met at Oracle selling software \u2014 and we quit our jobs and bought a one-way ticket to India a few months later. Then we backpacked through Asia for a year, that was in 2014. All the while there we were building a wellness business essentially teaching wellness entrepreneurs like Yoga instructors. Teaching them business skills: how to build a website, how to market themselves, things like that. Because we\u2019re business people that fell into the Yoga world, and we noticed that that community is not very good at business. We had the skills, so it was a nice match. We did that for 3 years traveling and working, and then bumped into Bitcoin in 2017. And then I realized, Okay, this is what I really want to be doing! And more or less, I put my foot on the break for the Yoga business stuff \u2014 hired a small team to run it \u2014 and then just decided, This thing\u2019s important here! I\u2019m gonna rearchitect everything on Bitcoin! If you think about it from the high level, the pendulum swung into the corporate world where I thought I was going, and then I just rebelled against it and did the complete opposite \u2014 backpacking hippie for a few years. And you know we meet sort of in the middle and there\u2019s Bitcoin! Which I think is a more wholesome synthesis of who I am! I think I\u2019m more suited for that! So yeah it\u2019s been a fun ride in Bitcoinland ever since!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [05:50]: Right. And mushrooms I think have always been part of your life from what I\u2019ve read! I think you grew up eating steak and mushrooms. But how did mushrooms become such a lens into the universe?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem: Yeah good point! I did grow up eating mushrooms just casually, just put it on your steak. And it wasn\u2019t until I graduated college \u2014 I had started experimenting with psychedelic mushrooms, I started foraging and just looking for Morel mushrooms, which are common in the United States. And it was through foraging that really kicked it off! You\u2019re just out in the woods, you\u2019re hiking around looking for treasure. That sort of kick-started an interest here. I started learning about what these things are, found out about Paul Stamets and started learning about them. That was maybe 2011 or so, that started. Yeah I carried that with me just as a side project! [06:40] I\u2019m always studying some weird thing. And it wasn\u2019t until we were living in Bali in 2018 the first half of the year and going to lots of meetups and writing for a crypto publication online which \u2014 anyways, forget that part of the story! \u2014 and then I started putting together the Mycelium Archetype. I first heard about it through Terence McKenna, who had explored the Internet through comparing it to Mycelium as sort of this living, breathing network-like organism where individual units sort of together create this larger whole. The sum is greater than the parts! And the whole network actually displays tendencies that a living organism might do! And so I had an epiphany that night in Bali, rode my scooter home, and just sat there and wrote and wrote and wrote, and more or less got probably 80% of the first article down \u2014 at least in idea form. And 6 months later I put it into an essay and published it. So it sort of merged the two worlds! It\u2019s quite shocking that in Bitcoin you can do something like that! As someone who\u2019s into a lot of weird stuff, the synthesis of the two and how it\u2019s accepted in this community is pretty special! Whatever you bring to the table, that lens sort of taints your perspective on Bitcoin! But it\u2019s also really useful, because you have these sort of analogies to draw on previous knowledge bases that people have, and so there\u2019s little short cuts into the Bitcoin ecosystem. At least that\u2019s how I see it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [08:22]: Yeah. I thought there were a lot of interesting things going on here! One I kind of saw you leaving Oracle and that kind of life and going out and building \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like your Mycelium, you going underground, you getting distributed, you gaining knowledge, trading, growing, and then you kind of come up with Bitcoin, it seems like. Maybe that\u2019s your spore, I think that\u2019s the word! And what I find that\u2019s really interesting is that you look at Bitcoin through this mushroom lens! And what I think is really interesting about that is also the timing of it. We\u2019re in the bear market and the article gets into that! You know, Bitcoin is like Mycelium, it\u2019s kind of growing organically and trading and learning, even though you don\u2019t see anything above the ground. And then you make this interesting connection where Mycelium and maybe Bitcoin are like dark matter and neurons in the Internet. They have life! Maybe you can touch on that: how is Mycelium like those things?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [09:21]: Yeah definitely! So Mycelium is \u2014 for people who aren\u2019t necessarily initiated into the world of fungi \u2014 fungi have their own kingdom. You have animals, you have plants, you have fungi, etc. There\u2019s millions of different organisms that make up this kingdom, and the predominant form these organisms take is the Mycelial form. And you can think of this like an underground root system. It\u2019s one cell-wall thick, it\u2019s just an underground Internet \u2014 it connects all the trees and plants together, it forms communication networks, it communicates, it trades resources, it sort of acts as an immune system for the forest, and from that lens you realize that a forest is not this competitive thing. Like, yes there\u2019s competition here and there, but really it should be looked at as its own ecosystem that acts as one unit! And the Mycelium is sort of the membrane that holds it all together! And that underground network archetype just seems to show up all over the universe. So fungi have been doing this for over a billion years on our planet. They\u2019re sort of the shepherds of life on our planet. This network system just seems to be a really effective evolutionary strategy. And then you start to realize, all dark matter and dark energy takes on this same network archetype. So if you zoom way out, it\u2019s the network. If you zoom in on your neurons, our brains our the same network archetype! And so you start to see it all around! And to me what that says is: it\u2019s an evolutionary strategy that whatever we call life employs, and it happens to be a very effective strategy, because fungi are the most resilient type of species on our planet \u2014 it\u2019s not even close! They\u2019ve survived all six mass-extinction events. Where you know, the dinosaurs get wiped out \u2014 fungi inherit the earth. It happens again \u2014 fungi inherit the earth. So this network archetype just seems to be sort of the definition of antifragility! And now you look at that through a Bitcoin lens and you realize, Okay, Bitcoin is like this Mycelial network \u2014 individual people and computer nodes. We all sort of make this network, and we all act in our own rational best self-interest just like the Mycelium does. But together you form this unit that adapts to its environment! It seeks out unmet demands and sends a signal to developers to go create some new software. If a bug is in the system, information travels through the network and it rebuilds. So it learns and it adapts, and it\u2019s very hard to kill because just like Mycelium you can break it in half \u2014 just literally break the organism in half \u2014 and now you have two organisms! And so you could cleave off a section of Bitcoin and you could go confiscate all of the miners in the United States, and the network routes around that and it creates an opportunity for another part of the organism to flourish! And you can sort of go down \u2014 and I like analogies, I find them to be effective. Obviously, Bitcoin is not Mycelium. But they\u2019re useful, and some people push back, like, Speak true or speak straight! But I prefer the analogies. I think they\u2019re more fun! And now thousands of people have reached out to me in DM saying, Hey! I didn\u2019t really understand Bitcoin\u2014this analogy worked! Or, I gave it to a friend, or, I didn\u2019t really think about Bitcoin in this way. And so it seems to have struck a chord. And to be fair, I\u2019m not the first one to talk about this. Ralph Merkle has a really famous quote where he says Bitcoin is a living organism. And if you haven\u2019t seen this quote \u2014 I don\u2019t have it pulled up \u2014 but it\u2019s a very, very cool, poetic way to look at Bitcoin! So I\u2019m standing on the shoulders of giants and since then many other people have written about it. Especially Gigi\u2019s work, Proof of Life, etc. That\u2019s a fantastic series!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [13:08]: Yeah we\u2019re talking to him in about a month! I really dig this whole, Bitcoin is a living organism thing. I think it is an emergent life form of some kind! Does Mycelium make mistakes when it\u2019s trading and learning? Does it have maybe an enzyme that is a casualty? The analogy I\u2019m kind of looking for \u2014 what I\u2019ve thought a lot about \u2014 is maybe the cyber hornets. Maybe they aren\u2019t making mistakes! But like Ross Ulbricht and Roger Ver \u2014 who you know were in the Bitcoin space and were acting maybe \u2014 they thought in their rational interest and maybe perpetuating or trying to grow the system? I don\u2019t know where their place would be in the analogy."}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [13:48]: Yeah how I would see that is, you can think of the Mycelial network in terms of a fungi \u2014 think of it like a million individual parts and that\u2019s actually how it operates! It\u2019s like this branching, forking little finger-like tentacles that are each individually exploring their locality. And let\u2019s say one of those forking little branches of Mycelium\u2014the edge of the network \u2014 let\u2019s say it comes across a predator of some sort. Another fungus or a bacteria. It sends information through the network to the specialist. The specialist mushroom scientist creates a custom enzyme \u2014 they\u2019re the best chemists on our planet \u2014 creates a custom enzyme, and then ships it around the network. And then the network learns and grows. It has essentially a chemical library of different new molecules that it invented for its own benefit to survive, and then you apply that to humans \u2014 all of a sudden, we start taking compounds from the fungal kingdom! The majority of our medicine comes from fungi because our biology is so similar. And the medicine works for them and it just so happens to work for us. So back to the Roger Vers of the world \u2014 how I see them would be: they\u2019re just one tip of the network. And they made a decision they thought was right. Now it seems like the network decided that they were wrong \u2014 but that\u2019s the deal! There\u2019s casualties here! Underground is the most hyper-competitive part of all of our ecological systems! It\u2019s gruesome down there! And same with Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s pure competition. You screw up \u2014 you\u2019re kicked off the network. No problem! And your reputation matters, and don\u2019t gamble with it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [15:29]: I love some of these fungi fun facts you put in here. Fungi eating rocks is the main reason we have top soil. Top soil enables us to grow food. It took fungi over 1 billion years to produce just 18 inches of top soil that we have today. I didn\u2019t even know anything about this! That part in the ecosystem, and the time it takes \u2014 any of this! I thought that was really interesting. What is horizontal gene transfer? And how is that different from other species or the way other networks work?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [16:01]: Yeah that\u2019s a super interesting point! So let\u2019s compare it to vertical gene transfer. In genetics this is Mother + Father copulate and have an offspring, that offspring has the genes from the mother and father so it\u2019s a vertical transfer from one generation to the next. And horizontal gene transfer is essentially \u2014 let\u2019s say there\u2019s two fungi in one ecosystem that are competing. And one fungi says, Wow, that other guy \u2014 he\u2019s doing really well! I wonder why he\u2019s so effective in this ecosystem? So the fungi eats the other one, or consumes some amount of genetic information. It absorbs from another species that\u2019s parallel to it, and then it incorporates that DNA into the species! I\u2019m anthropomorphizing here \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the fungi are thinking when they do this. But it seems like a last ditch effort that says, Wow, my strategy\u2019s not working! I\u2019m gonna steal their strategy and hope it works! And now if you compare that to Bitcoin, the analogy I use is that, Okay, there\u2019s thousands of different cryptocurrencies now \u2014 they each make different tradeoffs, they\u2019re all trying to create features to out-compete Bitcoin \u2014 I think the answer is it\u2019s futile but they\u2019re gonna try! And let\u2019s say there\u2019s some new technology that\u2019s produced \u2014 let\u2019s say zero knowledge proofs or some sort of privacy tech. Maybe Bitcoin wants to implement that! And so the Bitcoin Mycelial organism could perform horizontal gene transfer and just adopt what that other network uses and bolt that onto Bitcoin!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [17:34]: Yeah. You make these broad and excellent points relating human psychology, hype cycles, and the mushroom method. And you speak to how \u2014 again this was written during the bear market\u2014so I think it\u2019s really interesting that the mushroom goes through its own cycles. Maybe you could speak to that: how is that similar to Bitcoin cycles and our psychology and how we think about cycles?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [18:01]: Yeah definitely! I think that\u2019s a super fun analogy! So how Mycelial organisms lived is through underground \u2014 they\u2019re in that networked form. And when conditions are absolutely perfect, it concentrates its energy right below the surface of the ground, and then it produces a mushroom that shoots out of the ground. That mushroom is like the apple on an apple tree. The real organism is underground, just like the tree is the Mycelial form. However that fruiting body\u2014that mushroom\u2014that it is is a reproductive organ. It grows very quickly, and then it releases the little mushroom spores \u2014 tiny microscopic seeds that float around and they land nearby. And when they land nearby \u2014 as long as there\u2019s two of them near each other\u2014they fuse together and form a new colony. And then they live underground and they grow and grow and grow and then when conditions are right, that new organism reproduces by producing a mushroom! So that\u2019s the fungal life cycle. Now if we compare that to hype cycles in Bitcoin, most of Bitcoin\u2019s life, the price is boring! There\u2019s no hype \u2014 nobody\u2019s talking about it. That\u2019s the bear market! That\u2019s like the Mycelial form when it\u2019s just underground, networking, eating, growing \u2014 all those things. But when conditions are absolutely perfect in Bitcoin land, the price goes crazy, everybody starts talking about it, capital floods in, your taxi driver\u2019s talking about it, and just like the mushroom, out of nowhere it explodes! It very quickly matures and dies back very quickly. So that\u2019s the blow-off top. But just before it starts coming down, it recruits all these new people to the system, and those are like the little mushroom spores. And now the mushroom spores fly all around. Most of them died, but a few of those newcomers into the Bitcoin market stay! And those become the next wave\u2019s HODLers. And then the bear market \u2014 they network underground, they build resilience, that\u2019s when we\u2019re doing things like Proof of Keys, getting people to hold their own custody, learning about Bitcoin. Yeah that\u2019s sort of the bear market! It feels like the Mycelial organism is concentrating all that matter right below the surface, and it doesn\u2019t feel very long before a mushroom will pop out and the price will rise!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [20:18]: Right! The mushroom thing is so interesting because you talk about it in the book where humanity has had this long mysterious relationship with mushrooms: fear, maybe anxiety, euphoria, medicine. It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s even in video games! The red and white mushrooms in Super Mario Brothers \u2014 I never really connected these dots. You even tell us what kind of mushroom that is! And then it\u2019s like, Bitcoin conjures up a quasi-religious fervor. And we talked about it as a life form as well, and I feel both these kind of camps! How do these either inter-relate, or what does it mean that Bitcoin is like a religious fervor?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [21:01]: So the Mycelium of Money series is four parts. The first part is about Mycelium decentralization \u2014 essentially establishing that as a fungus. The second one is about the social layer. That\u2019s humans interacting with Bitcoin. And you can think of that as humans interacting with mushrooms! And I take a long time-scale to go through that one, and what I\u2019m trying to bring up is that humans have had relationships with mushrooms for as long as we can look back in time. Oftentimes that\u2019s simple food. They can be used to sharpen your knives, as medicine, to transfer embers, to get you high, they can kill you, dyes \u2014 all kinds of things! There\u2019s lots of fossil evidence of ancient man using these tools. There\u2019s one famous one: \u00d6tzi died in the Swiss Alps like 8,000 years ago. And what he had on him was a necklace with one mushroom which hardens when it dries out. It\u2019s so hard it can sharpen steel! And he had another mushroom that you can store an ember and travel long distance. You can have one ember for three to five days inside this. It\u2019s called a tinder conch. Think of a little vessel that keeps a spark alive. And if you think about ancient man, fire is everything! He was crossing the Alps in winter, and of course you need your fire! So what this tells us is that ancient man realized how important these mushrooms were, and they formed a relationship with them, and the humans that formed a relationship with mushrooms out-competed the others! [22:37] Then you fast forward and now you start to have these societies that realize that certain mushrooms get you high. And at low doses that actually increases your eyesight. And so that makes you a more effective forager if you consume low doses of psilocybin. And at higher doses it creates more of a religious-like experience, or a community-like experience. So it would be like a bonding thing for the tribe. And higher doses like I said it\u2019s a religious experience \u2014 you\u2019re taking in all kinds of new information. And so there\u2019s a theory that that\u2019s why humans evolved! To have such large brains. Because there\u2019s this unexplained period in history where our brains were small small small small small, then all of a sudden our brains exploded! And that\u2019s the neo-frontal cortex! That\u2019s responsible for language, symbolism, higher critical thinking, religious ideas. And so I tease with that idea just a little bit there, and then there\u2019s all these examples of different tribes who worship the mushroom in different ways, or have ceremonies with it or whatever. And Bitcoin\u2019s kind of the same way! It\u2019s sort of this mysterious thing that people feel like they discovered something when they find it! You want to evangelize it as soon as you get it! And so there\u2019s all kinds of parallels with the religious side. And now some people \u2014 we live in a very secular society now so a lot of people aren\u2019t really into religion\u2014that\u2019s fine, I\u2019m not either! However, from the religious angle in Bitcoin, people would try to say, Oh! You\u2019re so religious! You\u2019re zealous! You\u2019re tribal! That\u2019s true, right! But they try to use that as a bad thing! If I\u2019m investing in an upstart money that is attempting to overthrow the incumbent dollar and all the power that comes with it \u2014 I want crazy religious people to defend this network, especially in the early days! It\u2019s like providing cover fire to get Bitcoin through the door. Once it gets to a certain size, it will become too big to fail, and so the religious community around it is massively massively important. Guys like Michael Saylor realize this \u2014 he coined the term the cyber hornets. [24:45] I think that\u2019s quite apt! Yeah and now here we are: a bunch of crazy people overthrowing the legacy system peacefully! And it\u2019s attracting the smartest, most interesting people on the planet to this thing \u2014 this thing that somehow represents truth in a world without it! And it gives young people purpose! It just feels like the right thing to do! And it feels like something that humanity needs! So myself and many others find it very easy to dedicate most of our waking hours to this thing. And podcasts popping up everywhere, incredible writers \u2014 the industry is just flourishing! So it\u2019s quite fun to be a part of it, I would say.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [25:30]: I have to be honest, I love these two works! I think I want to turn a little bit more to the Rhythms of History. But as we wrap up kind of talking about the Mycelium of Money, I see almost these two pieces as \u2014 they\u2019re very different voices to me \u2014 and I mean that as a compliment! I feel like they\u2019re written from two different people. I think there\u2019s many facets to brand it, I\u2019m just really curious \u2014 this is just like a drop in the bucket! The first book for me is a page-turner. I just gobbled it up! And you put it on your website \u2014 I love this \u2014 it\u2019s a 58-minute read. I did it in an hour and fifteen or and hour and a half. But that to me was a page-turner! And the next \u2014 and I think these should be books! But I also feel like we\u2019re making our way through a trilogy. So the first one is like\u2014in the great trilogies of the world, maybe this isn\u2019t the greatest trilogy, but Star Wars: A New Hope \u2014 and now we\u2019re moving into the the Rhythms of History: The Empire Strikes Back! And we got this greater macro front that we\u2019re dealing with. And I don\u2019t know what the third opus will be! But I really want to turn to the second one. And as we phase into that \u2014 you make a point though in the Mycelium of Money about Bitcoin getting through the great filter of crypto \u2014 and that religious fervor will help it survive. And I see that. But I\u2019m almost like, Screw crypto! This is what\u2019s gonna help us get through the great filter of humanity. So we have this birth of Bitcoin, but now we got this larger context that we\u2019re all dealing with in these turnings. And to kind of speak on that, you put on the website, the turnings was a 50-minute read. I did it in about six hours over two days. I read like three paragraphs and then I had to go for a walk and think about things! We talk about how we go through time, and time is maybe not completely circular, maybe not completely linear. I\u2019ve heard [??? 27:43] say it\u2019s more like a spear, continuing through time but there\u2019s a circular nature to it. But what are these turnings that we\u2019re dealing with? And let\u2019s start from really wide out: what is a 90-year period of turning?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [28:01]: Yeah! So just to comment quick on the great filter. This is just a fantastic framing I think, both for Bitcoin and \u2014 I like what you mention with regards to humanity\u2019s point here \u2014 it might be humanity\u2019s point. If someone\u2019s not aware of what this is, it\u2019s essentially asking the question of, If there\u2019s so many galaxies and so many planets around the world, why don\u2019t we see life around us? Why isn\u2019t there spaceships, why hasn\u2019t anyone visited us, why haven\u2019t we seen any evidence? And the thesis is that, as life develops, there becomes these crucibles, these really hard challenges, and most species die out when they hit these challenges. It sort of filters out these species. So maybe there was a million humanoid-like species around the world, but they can\u2019t ever figure out how to get off their own rock, and so they eventually bomb themselves off with nukes. So that could be a great filter! Or maybe the great filter happened behind us! Maybe it was from single-cell to multi-cell organisms! Maybe that is really hard to do! And so there\u2019s single-cell organisms everywhere, but very few make it past that! We don\u2019t know! But it\u2019s nice to think about. Now if we think about Bitcoin, I call the great filter of cryptocurriences the nation state. Many people call it the final boss. My framing there was, if your cryptocurrency doesn\u2019t feasibly stand a chance at surviving a state-level attack, then there\u2019s absolutely no point to continue. Because they\u2019ll let you get big, and up until the point where it matters, and then they\u2019ll squash you! And 99.999% of cryptocurrencies will not pass this filter. I think Bitcoin is the only one that I feel confident that it will! [29:47] Yeah I don\u2019t think anything else will at this point! Now let\u2019s transition to the Fourth Turning. For context this is a book written in 1996 by two demographers \u2014 they spent like 30 or 50 years studying demography, and they realized, Why! There\u2019s all these patterns! And why are all these patterns coming up? They put this into a series of books. The Fourth Turning is one of those books. It\u2019s like the Cliff Notes of their book called Generations, which is like an encyclopedia of history and trying to find patterns. Most people think of time as a linear process. From a worse past to a better future. And that\u2019s sort of the culture today. You mention from the Jewish tradition they view it as a spiral? It goes upward over time? That makes sense. That\u2019s actually a really good point: lots of ancient cultures had observed cycles of history! And the main one he measured was called the Saeculum, which is a long human life which happens to be between 80\u201390 years. And for whatever reason every 80\u201390 years we go through a crisis period\u2014this is typically war! So 80\u201390 years ago we have World War II, before that we had the Civil War, before that we had the Revolutionary War. And so, Why does society have this crisis every 90 years? You dig in deeper and all of a sudden you realize that there are very clearly defined stages! In a 90 year period there are four stages, or four turnings. You can think of Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. And they\u2019re really a mood, and that mood would allow you to predict how society would respond to a catalyst. The mood helps you observe it from that way. And why are these moods created and why are they so observable? Because humans \u2014 just the way we emerge through culture and society \u2014 we have this repeating pattern of four different archetypes: the hero, the prophet, the nomad, the artist. And what happens is, based on the mood at the time when you\u2019re born, that will imprint you as a young person. So everyone in the milennial generation, we grew up during the unraveling, and now we\u2019re all sort of the same. Then when we grow up, now as this well-defined generation, we start to act based on our upbringing in predictable ways, and we start to imprint history! And then the next generation, they\u2019re dealing with all the crap that we put on them, and then they do the same thing! I\u2019ll pause there for a second to say that the thesis comes off as something that shouldn\u2019t be true. Many smart people bump into and they go, Ah! That kind of sounds like a stretch! I hear lots of counter-examples in my head! I can\u2019t even believe this! And what I would say to those people is that the book itself adds a lot of color. This thesis needs a ton of examples before it really clicks. And I try to summarize it in the essay, but if you are interested and you want to go deeper, I think the book will help solidify these. And now I see this runs pretty much everywhere! I can\u2019t help but observe through this! So it does seem fundamentally human. To bring us to present time, we\u2019re right in the middle of the fourth turning, which is the crisis period! That\u2019s essentially the realization that our institutions are crap! This is our politics, this is our healthcare, our governments, this is everything external to the individual \u2014 all the institutions are garbage! And then we all of a sudden realize, Wow! We really do need these institutions! What is healthcare was good? What is politics was good? So people had this collective realization that they want to re-do it and they want to have good institutions again! And you can look at that as supply and demand of order. A high supply of order means our institutions are doing well. A low supply of order means that our institutions are bad! So we have a low supply of order now, but as you enter the fourth turning, the demand for order is accelerating. It\u2019s rising very quickly! So that causes a frenzy, so any little spark in a fourth turning will be a really big deal, because we\u2019re all primed to make that change. We\u2019re in the middle of a fourth turning now, we have probably about ten years left. It started in the 2008\u20132009 global financial crisis, and I predict it to end around 2030. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve hit the climax yet so I expect some turbulence here, and then I expect massive changes to politics, to healthcare, to money \u2014 everything\u2019s gonna change! And the analogue is 1929\u20131945. So that was the previous fourth turning. It started with a financial crisis in the stock market, the Great Depression, FDR\u2019s New Deal. Now we get into World War II and then we have Bretton Woods towards the end of World War II. All kinds of things changed: U.N., NATO, World Bank, IMF, social security, pensions \u2014 all kinds of crazy stuff was built there, and it was very unprecedented at the time! Now we take these things for granted, but at the time it was very radical! FDR ran off a campaign of fiscally sound budget! He was gonna balance the budget. And then a few years later he\u2019s passing the largest stimulus bill in history, and going full Keynesian and doing all kinds of crazy stuff! And the business people at the time \u2014 the government\u2019s in desperation \u2014 so they\u2019re reaching for money wherever they can get it. And the business people at the time are going, Okay, we either print a lot of money, or they\u2019re gonna start taking money from the people who have it! So all the business people are like, Yeah, fine! Devalue the currency! No problem! And of course we know that devaluing the currency hurts the little guy more than the people with assets. And that started deficit spending during a crisis. And now we\u2019re deficit spending for fun! Everyone gets some points !\u2014 if you\u2019re Stephanie Kelton.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [35:52]: I want to dig into a lot of what you just said there. To frame it up, I want to talk about the prophet, the hero, the nomad, the artist. Who they are? I think that\u2019s gonna help people understand where they fit in these turnings. What are these macro forces that have molded them. But I also want to think a little bit about how does one maybe not be a part of this? What is the prophet, the nomad, the hero, and the artist? Let\u2019s use today\u2019s baby boomers, gen x, millennials, gen z definitions?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [36:33]: Yep! Let\u2019s do that. But first I have to address the point of how do we not participate? This one comes up a lot! It sort of feels like, if this is true, then our future\u2019s already written \u2014 so what\u2019s the point? Right? That\u2019s sort of the thing that comes up. But the reality is, this is a very general approach. This is how society moves. You can think of it like, let\u2019s say there\u2019s twenty variables in how you measure society. How do we approach politics? How do we raise our kids? What is the supply and demand of order? Are we individualistic or communistic? Each one of these are on a pendulum that just swings over time. And the mood just determines \u2014 it gives you a rough angle: are we increasing in demand for order, or decreasing? Right? So it\u2019s very broad! You can\u2019t avoid it at the society level, but at the individual level you can break every single one of these rules no problem! And many people do! But it\u2019s really just how that group-think occurs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [37:34]: Were you breaking the rules and busting the mold when you quit your job and went overseas? Or are you still subjected to these macro forces even though you\u2019re trying to get out of the system?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [37:45]: Yeah it\u2019s interesting. So as a millennial myself I\u2019m a \u201chero\u201d generation. Heroes grow up in the unraveling which is deregulation, everybody\u2019s getting drunk at the party, nobody\u2019s trying to end the party, this is the 90\u2019s, this is the early 2000\u2019s, the gettin\u2019s good! Nobody really cares, nobody is asking questions \u2014 it\u2019s fine, right? So millennials actually grow up over-parented, and the reason is because the previous generation \u2014 Gen X \u2014 they were under-parented, so a whole country in America hated kids because they were the black sheep kids\u2014they didn\u2019t have supervision, so they were bad boys! And so millennials are a response to that, saying, Wow! We gotta fix the kids! So millennials are super-overparented, you can\u2019t hurt \u2018em, we\u2019re bubble boys, thirteenth-place ribbons, we\u2019re all special, so we grow up with that, and then we also come of age during the crisis. This is the period where we rearrange the exterior world, we go to war, or we do something big enough to change everything. That\u2019s sort of the millennial generation: that\u2019s the hero. The risk with the millennial generation is that they\u2019re too orderly, they\u2019re too collectivist. So we\u2019re gonna flirt with socialism \u2014 we already are! And the millennials like that, they choose that! They unironically call each other comrade, which obviously if you pick up a history book you might realize how stupid that is. But they don\u2019t! And they actually prefer to over-index towards collectivism rather than individualism. And I feel \u2014 myself \u2014 I do not fit in with this model at all! I\u2019ve always been individual, go against the grain, do my own thing. However I see my peers very much like this! So that\u2019s sort of the thing here: I might break the mold, but my friends haven\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s pretty obvious. So that\u2019s one generation\u2014let\u2019s go through a few more to actually get to your point. [39:44] The next generation is the prophet archetype. The prophet archetype is the baby boomers. These are the people who grew up, they were born after World War II. Everything was given to them after World War II \u2014 this was Pax Americana, white picket fences, the gettin\u2019s good, suburbs, equality is high, and then these little spoiled kids who got everything, they grow up and they realize that the culture was sterile, it\u2019s boring, there\u2019s no edge, the music sucks, nobody\u2019s doing anything spiritual, and so that prophet archetype comes of age and they cause an awakening. This is a rearranging of the interior world. And that\u2019s halfway through the cycle! So at the midway point we rearrange the interior world \u2014 at the end of the cycle in the fourth turning we rearrange the exterior world. And the prophet is responsible for that interior revolution. This is the psychedelic 60\u2019s, Civil Rights movement. Before this this would be the Puritans, and any religious movements \u2014 they happen at that period! They grow up, they\u2019re principled, they\u2019re narcissistic, they\u2019re ideological. They\u2019re all hippies, right? Then that ended, they had a wake-up call, and then they became yuppies. And they were the individuals. They didn\u2019t actually want to grow up \u2014 they were the ones who raised Gex X\u2019ers without any supervision. That brings us to Gex X. They\u2019re the nomads, they\u2019re practical, they\u2019re like, Just tell me what to do and I\u2019ll do it! They\u2019re usually the ones who have to make the hard decisions, they\u2019re the bad boys, they\u2019re pragmatic, and throughout history they were never the key leaders. They were always the strong general who actually won the war. They put their head down, they did the things nobody wanted to do and they got it done. Versus the prophet \u2014 baby boomers \u2014 are more like sit in the tower and talk about how we see eye-to-eye or we don\u2019t. The Gen X\u2019ers don\u2019t actually do that much to culture compared to the prophet and the hero\u2014the millennials and the boomers. [41:52] And the reason is obviously that the prophets create the interior revolution, the heroes create the exterior revolution. And the nomads are just sort of part of the process and they bridge the gap. They don\u2019t actually cause too much changes in the world. Then the heroes, the millennials, and then you have the youngest generation now, this is Gen Z. This is the artist! They\u2019re caring, they\u2019re indecisive, and artists grow up during a crisis. So they\u2019re growing up right now. The previous artists were the silent generation. They grew up during the Great Depression, and they didn\u2019t want to rock the boat. They were conservative, they were silent, just in the background. And the young people today they\u2019re growing up during the crisis so they\u2019ve become sort of withdrawn and sensitive and they\u2019re conservative with their values. They don\u2019t want to risk anything because it\u2019s pretty risky out there! And the Gen Z are gonna grow and be the empathetic mid-lifers, they\u2019re great grandparents \u2014 fantastic grandparents! Yeah they don\u2019t really mold the world that much, but they prevent the Millennials from going overboard, because if the Millennials go overboard, the heroes go overboard, we have this very orderly, rigid society! Nazi Germany would be an over-indexing of the hero generation: we\u2019re all on the same team, you\u2019re either with us or you\u2019re against us, strong central planning, no problem if we get rid of our liberties because this is good for everyone. And so they\u2019re willing to make that sacrifice! The artist is a little bit different. They don\u2019t want to be under a strong rule like that! So that\u2019s the four, and interesting throughout history, they just go in that order: prophet, nomad, hero, artist. And each one influences the next, and the constellation \u2014 so is a hero old or young? Is an artist old or young? What stage of life are they at? That constellation of the archetypes is how you know what mood we\u2019re in. Yeah that\u2019s a long-winded answer!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [43:55]: I\u2019m really concerned about the Gen Z generation! My children and everyone\u2019s kids growing up during this crisis, this fourth turning \u2014 at the peak of it maybe \u2014 you know if it was a financial crisis I feel like I could just sweep that under the rug and not really affect that. This COVID crisis is a little more in their face. I read what you wrote about that generation and it rings true! But I don\u2019t want my kids to necessarily be meek or just standing off to the side. Maybe with great advice but not really taking action! The other thing \u2014 your background is in writing, communications, and it seems like there\u2019s a lot of references to Hollywood. When we talk about Gen X I think about Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men. That kind of archetype. And I wonder too, what if we got a strong individual as a president? Can that change these moments? Or is the president a reflection of the moment? And I\u2019m not trying to get political. Can strong individuals disrupt these generational turnings? And I\u2019ll go one step further: like Satoshi. We start going through the hard times, the good times \u2014 whatever the quote is \u2014 and a lot of people say we\u2019re in the soft times, but I\u2019m like, But I don\u2019t know, Satoshi\u2019s like the hardest dude out there! Hardest thing out there: man, woman, or group, that put this together and is gonna take us further, maybe into a fifth turning! You get to this later in the article. But can strong people interrupt these things?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [45:36]: First about your children and the other Gen Z\u2019s out there \u2014 yeah as a generation they\u2019re caring, indecisive and meek. However they\u2019re not all like that! You have a massive influence on your kids! But you just know the gravity wants to pull your kids that way. And if you know that you can sort of steer around it. Also with the artist, they become adults in the first turning, which historically that\u2019s a time of peace, high equality \u2014 things are really good! And so they\u2019re gonna hit their 20\u2019s post-crisis, and they\u2019re gonna be potentially in a much better world! So each generation sort of has their trade-offs, and they get the crisis out of the way early! The boomers, they\u2019re all trying to retire right now and they\u2019re gonna find out pretty quickly that they don\u2019t have as much retirement money as they thought they did! So each generation has its own struggles. [46:28] Regarding the strong man, the president. That\u2019s an interesting point! In the fourth turning, we have a strong demand for order, and what that usually manifests as is a very strong president! This is the archetypal big man with a stick. He\u2019s the alpha male, when times are tough, the biggest, strongest guy gets to make the decisions and everyone falls in line. It\u2019s very human! In a sense Trump does display this: he has bravado he\u2019s loud, he\u2019s a bulldog, and so many people say, You know it\u2019s not working! We want a strong president who will just make decisive bold actions! Another thing, interestingly, is during all fourth turnings, what ends up happening is there\u2019s a great champion who leads us out of the dark night! And a great champion is usually an older person who\u2019s in a leadership position \u2014 usually a president in the US \u2014 and they do the hard things and they rally the troops, and they have incredible support from the populace to vote for them! And that person is the one who makes the hard decisions. What I don\u2019t know is, I don\u2019t think Trump was our great champion. I don\u2019t think Biden will be our great champion. So maybe our next president is the one that actually takes us out of this. And if that\u2019s true, we might have a dark period here for four years, because we want our great champion as soon as possible, because that\u2019s when the mood shifts and we go, Okay we\u2019re rallying around this, we\u2019re gonna make it happen with this guy! And that\u2019s when the change occurs, because you need to get everyone on the same page in order to make these massive changes! And historically war is the only thing that motivates people to make huge changes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [48:11]: We\u2019ll get to future presidents. I do have a question around that. The anatomy of the fourth turning, so where we\u2019re at now. You wrote, Welcome to winter, a time of fire and ice. The supply of social order is still falling, but the demand for order is steadily rising. Although not required, fourth turnings historically end with total war. This was one of those moments where I put the book down and I went for a long walk. This was the sixth or seventh walk! You talk about how COVID is the thing that will bring us together to get us through the turning, and you question whether it\u2019s a strong enough moment of unison. It doesn\u2019t seem to unify. And you say war is usually that thing, but maybe war is not gonna happen here now and I think I agree because countries are turning inward. They\u2019re no longer pillaging outwardly. But I do think it\u2019s war-like turning inward on their own. My latest thought is that the country that does the best job at feasting inward will then take that superpower outward. Via cyberwar, psychological warfare, information and misinformation warfare. I don\u2019t want to get too dark, but like, where do you think we\u2019re going over the next few years or really ten years, before we get out of this?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [49:43]: Yeah I am pretty concerned to be honest! I think just looking, if you zoom way out, the trend is toward totalitarianism, and right now every nation state is playing this game. It\u2019s not like we can point to the Axis of Evil or the rise of Nazi Germany as the \u201cbad guys\u201d. Right now every single nation is grasping for as much power as possible, almost as if they can\u2019t help themselves, and so it is pretty concerning. I\u2019ll get to what I think is gonna happen, but before that let\u2019s do a morphology of a crisis. What are the stages in each 22-year fourth turning period. So all fourth turnings start with a catalyst. And this is a defining moment, it\u2019s very clearly a before and an after moment, and this would be the \u201808/\u201909 financial crisis. After the dot-com leading up to \u201908, not much had changed all through the 90\u2019s up to \u201908, and then all of a sudden, everything changed in \u201808! This is Occupy Wall Street, you see Obama runs on Hope and Change. Prior to that it\u2019s like, Let\u2019s keep doing what we\u2019re doing! After \u201908 it\u2019s like, We gotta make a change! So that was the catalyst. Then there\u2019s a regeneracy period, and that\u2019s realizing that, Okay, times have changed. Now there\u2019s a new force, a counter-entropy that gets people involved and active. This is things like Bernie Sanders, the rise of Democratic Socialism, Social Justice Warriors, this whole new counter-culture to the previous culture. This is mostly led by the populist Left that\u2019s leading the culture of the day. They define the rules of engagement from a culture standpoint, and I would say that around 2012 we were firmly in that! Then the next point is the climax. This is the big one. This is bombs being dropped on Pearl Harbor, this is Paul Revere shots heard around the world, rallying the troops, this is the Civil War, etc. Typically \u2014 in March I thought the climax was going to be COVID. I thought it was going to be this big thing, it sucks, everyone rallies together and we get through it and that marks the climax. But now like you already alluded to I think it\u2019s just ripping us apart. It\u2019s become this hyper-politicized thing. I don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on there! It just feels like a power grab at this point. So I think it\u2019s just gonna be fuel that leads to a larger crisis. Typical in fourth turning, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s one thing and everything\u2019s normal. One small crisis leads to another crisis which leads to another crisis until the whole thing topples over. So I see COVID as the starting point for ramping up towards the real climax, and after the climax there\u2019s a resolution period where the scores have been set, we rearrange all the pieces, and we start on a new path. But how is this gonna play out? I think there\u2019s four things: (1) it could be COVID. I don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s big enough. (2) We could have total war, but it seems like no one is in the mood for total war. However maybe in the next five years we have these new central bank digital currencies, China is trying to assert their dominance, maybe China oversteps their bounds and the US and China get into a little tango. That\u2019s possible. (3) It could also be a black swan event, something unpredictable. Terrorism, some sort of weird hack that causes something to happen. (4) Or it could be civil war. And sadly I think this is the most likely! There\u2019s a lot of stats that back this up, things like 50% of people said that they think that violence is justified in order to get your political war passed. 26% of people said that they\u2019re willing to have their state peacefully secede from the United States. So there\u2019s all these little metrics: the divide between the cities and the rural people, individualists versus collectivists. There\u2019s all these tension points. They\u2019re getting worse, they\u2019re not getting better. The politicians are actually using this to their own advantage! Then you combine it with the media \u2014 everything\u2019s feeding on this division! And what\u2019s scary is that all it takes is one little spark and you could see some really really nasty stuff around our country. Now it will not be a North vs. South clearly defined thing. It will be this confusing quagmire of you don\u2019t know who\u2019s who, you have the separatists over there and the group over there and weird flag this and that, martial law, transportation\u2019s bad, food\u2019s disrupted. Just a general feeling of unsettledness, and various people will be freedom fighters and whatever that looks like. Weird militias coming around. That\u2019s what I sadly think is the most likely \u2014 I hope we don\u2019t reach that! You mention Bitcoin as the fifth turning. And so I do think there\u2019s a chance here! Bitcoin is unique. It sort of serves as an institution. And what we need now are strong institutions. So what if Bitcoin was this thing that we could architect around? It\u2019s fair, it sort of appeases the Millennials because it\u2019s fair \u2014 it\u2019s not twelve old white guys running the money. It is a network, it\u2019s a community. So theoretically that could be the thing! What it does uniquely is \u2014 we\u2019re also in a bad economic situation as well as all this social unrest. So Bitcoin is sort of this life raft. You can get on the life raft instead of sinking on the Titanic. And the quicker we get people on this life raft, the fewer people are gonna be desperate and flailing and backed against a corner which is when people become violent. Rational people don\u2019t become violent but if push comes to shove, normal rational people do become violent! I think Bitcoin both at the individual level \u2014 because you don\u2019t have to go down with the ship financially \u2014 and at the society level, whether that\u2019s a corporation protecting their person in power, whether that\u2019s Iran getting around sanctions and monetizing their energy assets in order to pay for imports in Bitcoin because the US doesn\u2019t let them play in the financial system, or another nation that might just wanna not be under a Dollar hegemony. Or their country\u2019s going bad and they have nothing to lose and they just YOLO into Bitcoin! I think all of these things just reduce the amount of suffering, and reduce the amount of people getting desperate. And so I\u2019m optimistic that Bitcoin could actually be the institution we need right now!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [56:28]: Yeah! Bitcoin as an institution makes me think of Nick Szabo\u2019s piece on social scalability. I thought that that was fascinating! Let\u2019s look at social media, though. I\u2019m curious if you think social media is a force for good or not? And let\u2019s start with the notion that\u2019s stipulated that social media decentralizes information and news and communications and that\u2019s been a force for good. I think that\u2019s kind of clear to a certain extent. I mean there\u2019s some negative externalities. But let\u2019s look at this question through maybe like the 2024 presidential election, and I\u2019ll frame it like this: social media I think will eventually get compromised, not that the three networks ABC, NBC, CBS were compromised, but that they were centralized. You\u2019ve got one narrative the country was feasting on one thing, one water cooler conversation. Social media is that now, but you\u2019re really talking about two algorithms. Let\u2019s look at 2024 and what if the election was like Jack Dorsey versus Mark Zuckerberg?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [57:31]: That could totally happen! It seems like we\u2019re in a situation where the most popular person wins. I think Trump sort of expanded the Overton window, meaning, what\u2019s the conversation that we\u2019re comfortable having? People think we have this choice, we can choose \u2014 anyone can become president! Not really! There\u2019s this extremely narrow band between the Left and the Right, and that\u2019s who we\u2019re actually voting on. But Trump is this external figure that didn\u2019t really fit into the band, and he showed that it was possible to strong-arm your way in without playing by the traditional rules. So I think going forward \u2014 Joe Biden is obviously a president of the 90's \u2014 he doesn\u2019t represent anything new or forward-leaning, or of this new paradigm. But I think 2024 like you mentioned \u2014 Dorsey versus Zuckerberg \u2014 I think that type of thing is possible! The tech companies are becoming more powerful than most countries. They\u2019re now starting to play the game with the big boys! They want to launch Libra \u2014 they kind of got put in their place with that. But they\u2019re getting old now. They\u2019re getting powerful. So I think that\u2019s very real. You mentioned the \u201calgorithm\u201d, and I think we\u2019re gonna see a lot more algorithms running our lives \u2014 they already do! But it\u2019s gonna get way more sophisticated! Especially when you see these central bank digital currencies being released. What that does is it gives \u2014 well the Fed and the government already are merging \u2014 so central banks and states are the same from now on. We\u2019re just accepting that. And what they\u2019re gonna do is give us all central bank digital currencies \u2014 our phone is our money. Maybe they\u2019ll try to put chips in us, hopefully not! What it does is it gives them granular control over individuals in the economy. They can say, You have too much money on the sideline, I\u2019m gonna give you 10% negative interest rates until you put that money to work, then they can give your kid as student maybe 5% interest to encourage savings. And so that just is too much power for the state, and the central banking class loves it! They think that they\u2019re the smartest guys in the room and they think that they can manage the economy from the ivory tower. When in reality the economy is a complex beast that no one can manage! So Bitcoin is sort of saying, We don\u2019t want humans to politicize the money \u2014 we know where that gets us! It works for a short period of time then it gets corrupted, and we suffer. So Bitcoin is trying to be the thousand-year institution. The non-politicized monetary base which we can then architect around. I have no clue what 2024 will bring! What I would say is: forget everything you thought. Don\u2019t look backwards! Anything is on the table looking forward! So in this period of high volatility I think it\u2019s smart for individuals to really do some assessment on your own life: where are your vulnerabilities, minimize your downside risk, essentially make yourself and your family antifragile, so that in the worst case scenario you\u2019re protected! That could be things like owning a second passport, owning Bitcoin, having a second job, not be over-leveraged with debt \u2014 all these different things. Minimize your downside risk and just plan ahead. It\u2019s too hard to say, but it will be volatile, and I think increasingly so for at least five years!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:00:54]: Right. I think best case scenario for 2024 and the battle the country really wants to have is Andrew Yang versus Cynthia Loomis! I think that would be stellar! In terms of the Civil War, if you compare the American project to maybe a network\u2014like you have the Bitcoin network \u2014is the American project or the American network important? And would a Civil War \u2014 a hard fork \u2014 be a positive thing for the American project and the world?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [1:01:23]: That\u2019s an interesting question! I would say that the American experiment is founded on principles that were way ahead of their time, and very clearly the best strategy for organizing at the time. What I don\u2019t know is, do we need these epically strong central states anymore? And I\u2019m gonna draw on the Sovereign Individual thesis a little bit here, which is that, for the Industrial Revolution period, whoever had the biggest army was the leader of the world. Previously this was the Navy \u2014 like the sun never sets on the British Empire because they had the strongest Navy. Then it became America\u2019s world after World War II. We\u2019ve gotten nukes and aircraft carriers guarding the oceans. Essentially what was rewarded was the state which had the largest capacity for violence! However, in the Information Age, which we\u2019re obviously in now, the whole logic of violence shifted! Now a big state\u2019s actually not that important, because having a big state is very expensive to maintain. Instead the defense \u2014 or the little guy \u2014 has the advantage in the Information Age. And that\u2019s through things like cryptography and Bitcoin! These are asymmetric technologies that benefit defense versus offense. And so in that world, I see \u2014 bringing it back to America \u2014 I see the fracture of America actually as a long-term positive thing! I would like to see smaller states with more control. How are you gonna govern Chicago and Western Illinois? They have nothing in common! And so why would the state do that? Maybe you should fracture it a little bit more! Why would D.C. make the same law that applies to cowboys in Wyoming and people who live in Silicon Valley? They don\u2019t have anything in common! And so I think we should fracture governance into the smallest unit possible. Now I don\u2019t know how practically a secession would go or a fracturing of the US \u2014 historically they\u2019ve been very violent! [1:03:25] You know, Catalonia tried to break away from Greater Spain. That was met with pretty aggressive response from the central government in Spain. So I don\u2019t know how it will work out. In the long run it\u2019s better, but nobody wants to give up their land!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:03:50]: How do you protect yourself during this fourth turning? So people can gird themselves before we can move to some more optimistic topics. Obviously protect your wealth with Bitcoin, minimize your debt, live below your means, have multiple sources of income, flag theory \u2014 we\u2019re gonna have a show with Katie Ananina coming out \u2014 so get that second passport, go where you\u2019re treated best, maybe set your business up somewhere else, go have your recreation somewhere else, spend money where it\u2019s cheap, don\u2019t be cancelable, don\u2019t invest in politics du jour, be self-reliant, become technical, become super-literate, do things for yourself, don\u2019t trust, verify, find a community, build your citadel you get into and stay vigilant! But let\u2019s turn to more optimism like, we get through this by hook or crook: what are we looking at in 2030? Is it a Renaissance? Is Bitcoin the biggest part of that?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem [1:04:55]: So it\u2019s really hard to say from our vantage point. We\u2019re approaching the peak here. And historically in fourth turnings it can resolve in a really positive way or it can just be a tragedy. And I don\u2019t think that story\u2019s been written yet. However I am optimistic because we have Bitcoin! And if we didn\u2019t have Bitcoin I would be extremely pessimistic right now! All trending forces are a centralization of power, and we\u2019re all farmed by our fiat overlords. That\u2019s the trend. And as a personal freedom advocate \u2014 I put that freedom as among the highest ideals \u2014 that\u2019s pretty scary! But thankfully we do have Bitcoin and Bitcoin is uncompromising! The state cannot do anything to Bitcoin. They can try but it will backfire! And so I believe that\u2019s sort of a moral force for society. It puts restraint on these overreaching governments \u2014 it takes a little power away and forces them not to misbehave, because Bitcoiners can leave with the capital and no one can stop people. You can go get another passport. There\u2019s gonna be a tremendous amount of innovation coming out of Bitcoin! And if you shun the innovation, you\u2019re hurting your own country. And if you accept innovation, you\u2019re gonna go into a brighter future! So what I would say is: I\u2019m very bullish on Bitcoiners. I think it\u2019s the best group of people on the planet right now, [it\u2019s] the force that we want to back , the horse we want to ride through the fourth turning as well, and if Bitcoin continues its path \u2014 like this year I think things have accelerated \u2014 if it continues like it does now, I think Bitcoin has a real shot at turning the world around! We\u2019re gonna go through a dark time no matter what, but the next period, the next journey \u2014 if Bitcoin\u2019s a part of this which is seems like it will be \u2014 I think we do have a chance for a Renaissance! You get the money sorted and you give people a chance to be more productive, and just that foundational element of fixing the money will have all kinds of downstream effects to improve our planet. From unlocking intellectual capital from people who are locked out of the financial system \u2014 they can save their money in Bitcoin \u2014 from removing all the time theft from inflation, so normal people can actually save their money in an asset that preserves the fruits of their labor. Capital preservation is what creates society! And right now we\u2019re doing the opposite: we\u2019re hot potatoing our money as quickly as possible! We\u2019re buying just-in-time plastic junk that lasts two weeks then we throw it away. So I think Bitcoin is the thing that we need right now in society. It\u2019s perfect timing for that pendulum to swing the other way. So if that occurs, yeah we could call the next cycle the Bitcoin Renaissance, which is a phrase that Brady says in Bitcoin, also a co-worker of mine at Swan, likes to mention. And I think that\u2019s very true! Now what I don\u2019t know is, will it happen fast, or are we talking a couple of generations until we see this Renaissance? And that\u2019s really hard for me to predict! Again time is not linear! No matter what we predict now will be wrong! And in ten years we\u2019ll look back and the world will be very different. Again I don\u2019t think it\u2019s predictable, but keep fighting for Bitcoin \u2014 that\u2019s the only thing I can think of that keeps me sane during the process \u2014 like Nic Carter said, you\u2019re building the cathedral one brick at a time, and we might not even be alive by the time it\u2019s complete! That pursuit \u2014 something greater than ourselves \u2014 that\u2019s a force that\u2019s needed right now! It gives me purpose! It gives many other people purpose. There\u2019s nothing to do besides brick by brick!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:08:48]: A Bitcoin Renaissance. That\u2019s beautiful! You know, that\u2019s the future and maybe tomorrow. But like, how could people use mushrooms today to help during these turbulent confusing COVID times? Mentally and physically how can it help them?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem: The mushroom fungal kingdom is very diverse. There\u2019s lots of ways mushrooms can help. They\u2019re good for your yard, healing the environment, cleaning up pollution, NASA\u2019s experimenting with Mycelium to grow moon bases. You can train the Mycelium to create the shape you want, and Mycelium can actually block radiation! So I see a merging with space travel. Mycelium is gonna really be useful for colonizing Mars \u2014 probably start with the moon. That\u2019s a couple ideas! Now at the personal level, this can be through supplements to improve your health. Mushrooms are \u2014 the molecules in them are considered adaptogens \u2014 you can think of it like it gives your body whatever it needs! If you\u2019re too stressed it will help with that. If you have too much inflammation it will help with that. If you have not enough inflammation it will help with that. It helps your body find homeostasis, equilibrium in the body. They\u2019re great for your immune system, your sleep, your mind, your body, so I would recommend everyone should be taking a mushroom multivitamin. Just a broad spectrum capsule of mushrooms that is fine, it\u2019s not too expensive. And it really helps your body deal with stress and stay healthy. Most people claim these are miracle drugs. I tend to be in that camp! However the science is just catching up. In general, studying health is hard so you\u2019re not gonna find the hardest hitting science on mushrooms yet. But certain compounds like Lion\u2019s Mane has been shown to improve dementia and Alzheimers \u2014 very clearly, massive results there. Other ones help with cancer, physical fitness, etc. And then there\u2019s another whole compound of mushrooms\u2014the psychedelic mushrooms. They contain a compound called psilocybin which is very similar to one of our neurotransmitters, seratonin, which regulates mood and several different things in our day to day life. The psilocybin mushrooms are very interesting because they\u2019re great tools for healing and introspection and exploration. I feel very strongly about these compounds because it benefited me in my personal life and thousands of other people. And they\u2019re starting to become legalized in the US. And so what we\u2019re gonna see is psilocybin therapy centers just like you go to see therapist or you go on a retreat or in previous times you\u2019d go on a religious quest or go see the temple or whatever. These things are gonna pop up and they\u2019re gonna be like nature retreats that also involve eating some psilocybin mushrooms! I\u2019m really optimistic about that \u2014 the world needs this type of healing. Also people are microdosing these things as sort of a mood enhancer or creativity booster. That\u2019s also very effective. But they are illegal. They\u2019re not for everyone \u2014 treat these things with respect. Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer! Do your own research! Don\u2019t trust, verify! All those things apply here! But they\u2019re very important right now. They\u2019re also criminally understudied! So if you\u2019re a budding young person and you\u2019re curious about this stuff, go into mycology! There\u2019s twenty Nobel prizes in mycology yet to be unlocked! It will help us in all of our future challenges and tons that we have right now, so that\u2019s gonna be a big one!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [1:12:40]: Awesome. In terms of doing your own research, you had the great article that you put out in your favorite podcast. It was a lot of homework, trying to dig through that. Highlight three of your favorite non-Bitcoin podcasts! We want people to come to Bitcoin, but we gotta go somewhere else sometimes and see what other people are talking about! What are some of the best podcasts that you\u2019ve heard outside of Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Brandon Quittem: Lately The Portal by Eric Weinstein has been one of my favorites. His whole catalogue is amazing. He sort of has the hard conversations that need to be had, and he doesn\u2019t play by the politically correct rules, and he would be part of the Intellectual dark web if you\u2019ve heard of that. Very heavy, deep conversations \u2014 I have to look up tons of words.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: The one with Peter Thiel is great!"}

I\u2019m optimistic that some Bitcoiners will get on there! Another podcast outside of Bitcoin that\u2019s really nice is the Santa Fe Institute podcast called Complexity. It\u2019s about complexity theory and complex systems, it blurs science with data with studying complex systems. And Bitcoin is a complex system! My favorite episodes are the ones that blur biology and ecology with economics. You blur these things with how human civilizations grow and what scaling principles can we take from all human civilizations? That one\u2019s pretty mind bending! I\u2019m just dipping my toes in so I\u2019m no expert there. That\u2019s two. I like Hidden Forces as well, with Demetri Kofinas. I don\u2019t like all his episodes, but I think it\u2019s a great one. I\u2019ve learned a lot from that podcast. My throwaway would be Rogan because I\u2019ve been listening to it for ten years!

We did have Yan Pritzker on for #2: Inventing Bitcoin, Building Swan and Leaving Russia. We did have Andrew Edstrom on #14: In Bitcoin We Trust. Towards a more positive outlook on 2020 and what we can trust and have faith in. We spoke to Bitcoin Rabbi a week ago and that\u2019s gonna come out soon. And we do have Cory Klippsten on tomorrow where we\u2019re gonna talk all things Swan and Bitcoin TV. So I don\u2019t want you to think that we\u2019re omitting that!

We\u2019re building a great team, the customers are growing fast and it\u2019s extremely exciting to be a part of that team!

{"prompt": "Stephan Livera: Great! My listeners are already very familiar with Nicolas, and Nicolas is gonna be a guest co-host this episode. And Bunnie, let\u2019s hear a little bit about you? Where did you come from? What was your background?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bunnie: Yeah I guess you could say I\u2019m more of an electrical engineering background. I do a lot of open hardware work. I\u2019ve designed things ranging from 802.11 Wi-Fi chips all the way to nanophotonic integrated circuits in the past. And lately I\u2019ve been looking a lot at building secure open source systems, things that you can trust. Trying to figure out how deep the rabbit hole goes, because in my background\u2014since I have a lot of background in doing things like integrated circuits and building technology at that level\u2014I have a sort of grasp over how little control we have over what happens at certain lower layers of technology. And so the latest project I have going on is Precursor, which is an attempt to try and wrestle back some of that control, trying to peel back some of those layers and get them back into the users hands."}
{"prompt": "Nicolas Dorier [04:45]: For a Bitcoiner I think a nice way as well to present Bunnie is like the Pieter Wuille of open hardware, basically! The only difference is that you don\u2019t have a Pieter Wuille fact website about him but maybe that will come!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [04:57]: So I think one interesting question \u2014 and I know you\u2019ve done a talk on this question \u2014 is around how we might initially at the first glance think, Oh! Okay, open source means it\u2019s more secure and we can trust it more! And yet I think you were basically dispelling that notion saying, Well actually, there\u2019s a lot of things we don\u2019t necessarily \u2014 that doesn\u2019t go all the way! Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [05:18]: So open source is a necessarily but not sufficient condition for trust. The problem at the end of the day: imagine you can get the source code for your browser and you can compile it. And even if you can compile it, do you really know what\u2019s going on on the inside? You really don\u2019t! Because there\u2019s just like so many millions of lines of code on the inside and all it takes is one bad line of code to create an .EXE that could cause people to steal your private keys, right? And so the other half of trust is it can\u2019t be something so complicated that\u2019s intractable for you to audit or to understand at the end of the day. [05:51] So trustability almost becomes a property of a system that you have to design in from the top. When you talk about trustability from this absolute, self-sovereign standpoint, this trust from the standpoint of like, Oh this is an Apple iPhone \u2014 I trust it because of a brand! Right? But I don\u2019t \u2014 that in and of itself is more of like a faith, it\u2019s not a fact-based trust. It\u2019s based upon social opinions and repercussions if they violate the trust. Oh, it\u2019s against their corporate interest currently to violate the trust, whatever it is \u2014 because of the branding and whatnot. But that\u2019s not a brass tacks, physics-based trust. When I\u2019m talking about trust from this standpoint, If you want to stay and have an evidence based thread based on things that you can measure with your own two eyes and own two hands and convince yourself on from the bottom-up, a system has to be designed to be simple enough to facilitate that within a humanly-reasonable amount of time! To say that you\u2019re gonna spend 5 years auditing your browser\u2019s source code is not feasible because 5 years from now you\u2019re gonna have patches that are gonna be absolutely essential for you to be secure anyways, and for you to audit those patches will take another 7 months or whatever it is . So you have this eternal cycle of patches you have to keep looking at and you never get any work done, and also you never really catch up with the current status quo. And that\u2019s one of the problems with having an open source system that is too complicated. It\u2019s not physically possible to get to a point where you can trust everything inside of it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [07:14]: An interesting point you\u2019re making \u2014 you mention that most people see security as a trust in a label. On my side I got this kind of experience as well in the banking industry for custody, where it doesn\u2019t matter where at the level the thing is secure. Basically at the end of the day, they trust their label. Like some piece of equipment that they have been using for 20 years and has never failed them. It\u2019s kind of the trust inside the label that consumers have, but I think that you have big audiences that don\u2019t trust the label \u2014 one of them of course is the Bitcoiners! But I think another type that are mentioned actually is whistleblowers like Edward Snowden or the like that really wish for this kind of device, right?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [08:00]: That\u2019s absolutely right! And so in a way at a sociological level, trusting on labels is a thing that we almost have to do, because we don\u2019t have enough time in the day to look at absolutely everything in our life! This is a little bit tangential, but another thing I worry about is my food! How do I know there isn\u2019t heavy metal on the inside or some pesticide or something that can make me sick on the inside? You can worry yourself sick worrying about these types of things and never eat, but at some point I just have to trust that this restaurant is gonna serve me good food! And maybe the argument is that the chef eats the food too! At the very least they\u2019ll be as sick as I will be, and they have a self-interest in it, right? That\u2019s more of a sociological-type trust. There\u2019s a point where it\u2019s appropriate and you have to fall back on it, but I feel like on the technology front, we\u2019ve just surrendered so much to just black boxes with no explanation on the inside! And the other key point is that the trust system can come unravelled so quickly with a single backdoor patch. It\u2019s just castles built upon sand right now!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [09:04]: Yeah I think that\u2019s a really interesting way to put it. So in the Bitcoin world we have a saying, \u201cDon\u2019t Trust, Verify,\u201d but as you say, there\u2019s only so much that\u2019s practical for the average person, the normal person out there. And maybe you\u2019ll get someone who\u2019s a little bit more enthusiastic and they\u2019re willing to go through things. And in the software world, that\u2019s things like compiling the software or doing GPG verify to check that the signature matches and doing some level of what we might call Web of Trust or social networks and saying, Oh okay! Nicolas Dorier is a well-known guy and he signed off on this thing and I know these other guys signed off there! But I think the interesting point is that it\u2019s not so easy to do with hardware, right?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [09:44]: Yeah there\u2019s a couple of levels of issues in hardware. One is obviously, do you even trust the base design itself? Like, does this piece of hardware \u2014 the manufacturer that makes it \u2014 are they reliable? Does it have the features they say it does? Does it not have extra features they didn\u2019t tell you about? These are sort of the issues you have. And then you have the specific instance of the hardware that you\u2019re working with. And this is a key point of difference between software and hardware. In software, you have cryptographic tools to transfer trust. We can hash things and we can sign them and we can verify them very quickly at the point of view. So if Nicolas goes ahead and signs off on a package and says, I\u2019ve looked at the source code and this is good and you can use it \u2014 you can reproduce his efforts by hashing it in a way and checking the signature and you can say, Well at least I know that I have exactly that piece of code that he signed off on and I\u2019m using that. When it comes to hardware, you can\u2019t do that! There\u2019s no hash function for hardware. There\u2019s no easy way for you to snap a finger and say, this is exactly the Bitcoin wallet that the manufacturer intended me to have! You know, what if someone put a small chip on the inside to record your keystrokes? What if there\u2019s a little exfiltration device on the inside to exfiltrate your keys or whatever it is? These types of things do happen\u2014they sound a little crazy, but I mean there was recently some presentations at this year\u2019s CCC where they showed some, again, live implants in the wild, like just people finding them inside of their [secure?] phones and whatnot. They do happen! And that\u2019s also a level of thing to worry about, particularly when you start talking about things like Bitcoin which have inherent value in and of itself.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [11:18]: I remember in one of your talks you were really \u2014 I think it was a talk you made at the beginning of this year where you were explaining this trust problem. It was very well said! And basically your goal seemed to [be to] move the verification of hardware at the place of use. So how far do you feel you are from this ideal with the Precursor and also with the Betrusted environment that you are working on right now?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [11:47]: Right. So what Nicolas is referring to is that, in the security world we have this phrase called the Time of Check versus Time of Use problem. So if you go ahead and check that your browser was okay on the server, and then you went ahead and downloaded and someone man-in-the-middled your download and you didn\u2019t check it again \u2014 that\u2019s called a Time of Check versus a Time of Use. It was okay in the server but the Time of Use is actually after you download it\u2014someone can go ahead and modify it before you use it. And so in software there\u2019s a well known principle: you always try to check it right before you use it, the exact copy you\u2019re gonna run is the thing that you\u2019ve hashed and checked against the signature! Not some other copy in the cloud or on your disk. [12:21] In hardware, similar concept: there\u2019s a Place of Check versus a Place of Use. So one of the more laughable suggestions I\u2019ve seen is that people talk about like, Oh these sovereign fabs! Let\u2019s build a foundry on our country\u2019s soil, and that will help solve this problem of trust in supply chain! It\u2019s laudable on a number of fronts, but I think it\u2019s more of a political stunt to try and create local jobs. Which is fine, you can do that! But the reason why it doesn\u2019t help the Place of Check, Place of Use problem is that it\u2019s been established that a common vector for exploits is the couriers who deliver the package, or\u2014if you\u2019re buying off of a distribution site like Amazon \u2014 the customers who buy it tamper with it and then return it back! So people can buy like a hard drive, remove the tamper evidence seals, modify the firmware, implant something inside, and then restore the seals, and then send it back to Amazon. And then the distributor\u2019s like, Okay! Well they returned the product! All the seals are in place! We\u2019ll just resell this to someone else! You can\u2019t target who it goes to, but the fact of the matter is you\u2019re starting to put these devices out which have these implants on the inside. [13:22] And these are vectors that are completely close to the end-user. There\u2019s nothing about where the chips are made or where the factories are located or whatever it is! So you do all of this effort to create billions of dollars to spend on a sovereign fab, and at the end of the day the Place of Check is not the Place of Use. You still have this big disconnect in terms of a very trivial exploit path. And when I say trivial I mean also part of the problem is if you think about the incentives involved, you\u2019re trying to ship maybe say a Bitcoin wallet and you want to secure $1 Million of Bitcoin on it, and the person delivering it to you \u2014 how much are they being paid? What\u2019s their stake in guaranteeing the integrity of that packet? That person \u2014 what\u2019s their vulnerability to a bribe or to being distracted? The stakeholders don\u2019t have aligned interests in terms of getting you the level of integrity of the hardware that you\u2019re expecting to secure your secrets with. And so this becomes the existential problem that Precursor is trying to deal with. I haven\u2019t mentioned in detail what Precursor is yet on the podcast! For listeners who don\u2019t know, Precursor is an open hardware development platform for secure applications. And it\u2019s goal is to address these issues we\u2019re talking about so far in this podcast. You can go to precursor.dev, that\u2019s a website and it\u2019ll bounce you to our current crowdfunding site where we just closed a round of crowdfunding for it. And we plan on shipping the product in the late part of this year, 2021. And the idea is to explore the primitives and the necessary tools that we need to close this Time of Check to Time of Use gap. One of the cool parts about Precursor is that we use what\u2019s called a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) as the computing element, which means that instead of trusting a third-party to create your CPU\u2014which has your instructions, which has your encodings, which has all the debug backdoors, all this sort of stuff \u2014 normally we just trust ARM or Intel or someone like this to just create this CPU and we just take it as a black box! Crazy that we take it as a black box, but we all do! We don\u2019t know what hidden instructions are on the inside of it, right? Instead of that, you\u2019re given the source code description of a RISC-V CPU, and you can compile it yourself into the gates on the FPGA and then load it onto the device yourself, if you want to be able to get to that level of trust. It takes a little more effort than using the stuff right out of the box, but the point is that you can do it\u2014you are empowered to do it. And then people say, Well, but of course, what if the FPGA itself has a piece of closed source silicon? You know, it\u2019s turtles all the way down! This is true. It\u2019s true that there are still attack surfaces on everything \u2014 you can\u2019t seal all the doors. But, we\u2019ve really moved the goal posts forward! Because in the case of just getting a closed source CPU blob, someone could put a whole hidden instruction on the inside that just sort of socks away some bytes of memory into a small register somewhere inside the chip, and it\u2019d be very hard to discover this! You know, you could put a lock on it so you can\u2019t fuzz it out, but it can only be activated with certain instruction sequences \u2014 whatever it is. And it doesn\u2019t take a lot of gates to do that sort of thing, right? With the source code at least with our device, you can look at it and see [that] none of these things exist! [16:18] The instructions decoders are decoding only the instructions we say they are! No more, no less! And they\u2019re doing it properly! And then once you compile it down to the gates on the FPGA, the compilation process itself is a little bit random. We can\u2019t predict where the critical bits will land inside of this several hundred-thousand gate device. And because of that unpredictability, it makes it very difficult for someone a priori to implant something that will pull out that one critical bit. So now, any implant that tries to pull out or replicate what would be a trivial attack on a closed source piece of silicon, now becomes a very large \u2014 you\u2019re almost like implanting every bit of your RAM, you could imagine, as opposed to just looking at a single word bank at a well known location \u2014 now we\u2019re talking about orders of magnitude [greater] difficulty in terms of executing implants and detectability on fundamental parts such as the CPU, and the structure and the integrity of it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [17:16]: So if I\u2019ve understood you correctly then, you\u2019re saying that essentially, in the current world with ARM and Intel and so on, a lot of it is closed source and [it] would not be apparent from a visual inspection. And so what you\u2019re saying is, this is taking us one step closer to that vision of: the end-user is able to more clearly detect if there\u2019s something different about the device because \u2014 as I understand you, I might get this part wrong\u2014but the memory allocation is more random and therefore that just necessitates a bigger change to the physical device?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: [17:52]: Yeah! I\u2019m covering a lot of ground in a short period of time here! Let\u2019s tease apart two aspects of the design: (1) is the physical device itself and (2) is what\u2019s inside the actual chips. So let\u2019s start with the physical device itself, and so this is actually a little bit of a side jog from when we were talking about Intel and AMD. So first you have to trust the physical device itself is correct before we talk about anything else. Precursor is made to facilitate that type of inspection \u2014 it\u2019s very simply constructed: a single-sided circuit board. We give you reference images of it so you don\u2019t have to be technical to understand where you\u2019re going: you just have to visually do a diff between the two things to see if anything\u2019s different on the inside. And it\u2019s simply constructed, so it\u2019s not like you need crazy amounts of microscopes or whatever it is to do that type of thing. But that only gets you as far as a very gross, physical, like, What is this extra little black blob here with wires on it? Is that supposed to be on there? No! Okay, so that must be an implant on the microphone or something like this. That\u2019s the kind of thing you can tell at that level. Now, when you get to the CPU level, that happens all inside those little black blobs of epoxy! [19:02] And in order to inspect those, you would have to have a desktop-sized microscope that costs several million dollars. It\u2019s not practical for end-users to do that. And so our answer to that is that we then turn the CPU into almost basically a software description of a CPU. So all of those tricks we talked about in terms of signing and hashing and so forth, we could have a third-party auditor look at our CPU code \u2014 the description of our architecture, our equivalent description of an Intel or ARM CPU\u2014we give it to you at a level so that someone like Nicolas could look at [it]. He could sign off and say, This is good! You can take that code and confirm the integrity all the way to the point of your house. And then you can compile that code yourself into the gates of one of these black boxes. Now we\u2019re all admitting that we can\u2019t know what\u2019s inside the black box, but\u2014 where the key trick happens is that\u2014 inside the black box, when we give you our gates, it\u2019s a generic sea of gates! There are 30,000\u201340,000 LUTs on the inside, and we don\u2019t know what does what! They\u2019re all just generic \u2014 they do simple operations like Adds and Subtracts \u2014 a little bit simpler than that, but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s at that level. And then we have a program that maps our description of the CPU to those LUTs (look-up tables) on the inside. And that mapping is pseudo-random. Basically you can\u2019t \u2014 very small changes in the source \u2014 we basically put a random seed on the inside, is the trick that we use. And it foils people\u2019s attempt to take that generic sea of gates and bias it away, that would allow someone to exploit the code that we put on the inside. That\u2019s the basic argument. So we basically take the hard, gnarly hardware problem of knowing what\u2019s inside of our CPU \u2014 we turn it into a software problem \u2014 and we put it into a generic sea of gates which has a mapping property that makes it difficult for someone, in advance, to predict where your exact implementation will go. And that\u2019s where the security property comes from. [21:04] If you [run] the numbers, it becomes cryptographically secure at the complexity levels that we\u2019re talking about.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [21:13]: For [the listeners], FPGA basically is like the 3D printer of electronics. You have this, and you just fit that out [with] any source code you want and make it do whatever you want. In this case, making a CPU out of it. FPGA looks like anybody [else\u2019s]. It\u2019s really harder \u2014 at the component level \u2014 to pull out some kind of attacks in the middle because when the FPGA ships it can be used for anything!"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [21:42]: That\u2019s a really good example: a 3D printer for hardware! I mean it\u2019s not physically extruding things but it\u2019s a very similar concept.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier: What I really saw as well with FPGA is that, for the first time [I too] can learn how to make my own CPU and I think it\u2019s very powerful! It\u2019s a really powerful concept! It\u2019s something that cannot be stopped! I guess if [for] FPGA there is a lot of money for terror everywhere in the world, so I guess from a political condition, say the US can prevent China from making CPUs and try to impose tariffs on CPUs from some specific manufacturer in China, but when we are talking about FPGAs\u2014since FPGAs are like kind of a commodity hardware \u2014 it can be manufactured quite anywhere. That touches on another topic that later I want to touch on. It will make the Precursor more easily sourceable because basically the FPGA \u2014 they [can be] produced anywhere, right?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [22:39]: I think [at a] meta-level you\u2019re correct! In practice, we have to design in a single chip, because we have to make a circuit board at the end of the day and validate it. There\u2019s other laws we have to deal with like EMC compliance \u2014 we can\u2019t just swap out chips and then use the same FCC designation. It\u2019s other complications!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier: But somebody that understands Precursor will be able to do this though!"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [23:03]: Absolutely! The key point is: even if my venture were to fail, or if I were to \u2014 for some reason tomorrow cease to exist \u2014 someone else could pick it up, the source code is there, they can pick their favorite FPGA in a matter of days if not weeks, relay out the core design, and then use a different FPGA and you\u2019d be up and running again! I think your point of there not being a single point of failure in the chain that is hard to work around is very valid! Whereas right now, if you wanted an alternative to Intel and AMD that\u2019s really hard to get a functioning alternative to that!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [23:38]: There was also one point I wanted to know: in current Bitcoin wallets, lots of hardware wallets are using what\u2019s called secure elements, and apparently those secure elements are kind of a big blob of, \u201cTrust me, don\u2019t verify.\u201d On your side, how do you protect those kinds of secrets without relying on such blobs that actually can be very easily targeted because for sure it will be doing something secret, so it\u2019s a very [large] honeypot of [a] backdoor!"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [24:07]: That\u2019s a really good question! So now there\u2019s a third or fourth dimension of security which is tamper-resistance. Up until this point we were talking about, Have we taken the red pill yet? Basically \u2014 are we in reality? If someone gives you a piece of hardware that\u2019s been tampered with, you\u2019re sort of in the Matrix! You can\u2019t break out of it \u2014 there\u2019s nothing you can do! That\u2019s the existential question that Precursor has been trying to answer is like, Are we living in the real world, or has someone put us in a cage and we don\u2019t even realize it? The second aspect is, once you know you\u2019re in the real world, how do you know that you\u2019re continuing to live in that world, and that someone hasn\u2019t tampered with it, and also, can you basically leave your wallet somewhere, walk away, and know that \u2014 even if someone stole it \u2014 your secrets are safe? That\u2019s the tamper-resistance aspect. I can go into this for days! This is a huge subject of research in the silicon industry. But as a general principle: if you talk to anyone who has practiced extraction of secrets from silicon \u2014 who has pulled out keys from silicon, and I\u2019ve done this, and some of my colleagues have done this \u2014 our general opinion is that even the super-ultra-secure tamper-resistant guys, they\u2019ll hold up maybe like a day or two against a well-equipped lab. There\u2019s just no amount of \u2014 and if you get into the circles and you start talking [with] the guys about the unpublished work, you would just \u2014 your jaw would drop! The most powerful technique recently is this technique called Backside Imaging. So it used to be that you had to attack from the topside-down and you had to [strip] the wires \u2014 it was actually a very difficult attack! Now actually a lot of chips these days, they thin them down before they put them in the device to make the devices thinner. The chips are so thin that you can actually see the parasitic photons that the transistors emanate coming out of the backside of the chip! So the chip, as mounted, if you just look at it with a very sensitive camera \u2014 and this is cryogenically cooled stuff so it\u2019s not like everyday sorts of stuff \u2014 you can actually see the patterns of bits firing real-time without doing anything! You just turn it on and you can see the side-channel coming out of them! And because of this, even the most secure chips with all of these \u2014 they talk about secure meshes on top and PUFs (physically unclonable function)\u2014you can just turn them on! They\u2019re just emitting\u2014out the backside \u2014 all their secrets! Right? You just have to have a good enough device [that] depacks it well enough to see it. So this is where we\u2019re at today! [These are the] tamper-resistance issues that we have today! From that respect, I have an article that I wrote that\u2019s part of my Precursor campaign that\u2019s a deep dive into this. When you realize how bad [this] situation is, the problem is that we\u2019ve had such a long-running streak of untruth in advertising in this, people don\u2019t even know how scared they should be of what\u2019s on it! [26:36] So just the goal I have with Precursor is to be brutally honest as to what we can and cannot do. So I took my own design \u2014 another one of my lives: I\u2019ve done things like extract the security keys from the original XBOX, I\u2019ve done a lot of security work in the past \u2014 I took my best crack at my own design, and of course I found a problem! This is not a surprise, and it turns out that the strength of Precursor from a tamper-resistance standpoint is as strong as the epoxy that you can put on it. Basically, if you can break off the epoxy and the metal shield\u2014and you\u2019re a skilled attacker \u2014 you can extract the keys with enough time. A couple hours. But at this point you\u2019ll definitely know that someone has attacked it \u2014 you would see the evidence of the attack. It does take some time. But I would say that\u2019s roughly equivalent to about the security of a lot of devices offered. And honestly people say, Oh, my smartphone is so secure! A lot of them have just \u2014 plug-in a USB cable, run the software \u2014 it\u2019s jailbroken. So that\u2019s a zero-touch break. [27:33] There\u2019s no evidence of any sort of tampering with that type of break issue. So at least [the Precursor] doesn\u2019t have any issues that are that bad, but yeah if someone physically took your device and they had a specially designed CNC mill to remove the epoxy from it, they could read out the keys. And to react to that I introduced a self-destruct mechanism inside the device. If you are very paranoid, you can program what are called Volatile Keys \u2014 they\u2019re RAM-backed. Unfortunately, it really doesn\u2019t fit the use-case of archival storage of high-value secrets like Bitcoin, because the problem is that if you forget to charge your battery, you lose everything in the wallet! It\u2019s not the right solution for that, but for example if you have a device and it\u2019s to communicate with friends and you want to keep it very secure and if it gets into the wrong hands you want to make sure all the comms are wiped \u2014 that\u2019s actually perfect because the moment the battery is not charged anymore, all the keys are gone, and everything on the device is unreadable. So that gives you a bounded sort of risk on very volatile, high-value secrets, but the problem in Bitcoin of storing long-term non-volatile secrets \u2014 so like your wallet keys, that type of thing \u2014 it\u2019s a very hard problem!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [28:46]: Yeah so it\u2019s almost like a dead man\u2019s switch, if you will. So I guess we could talk a little bit about the potential applications of Precursor. I think you\u2019ve mentioned that it could be like a password manager or a Bitcoin wallet or some kind of messaging platform. Are these basically the main uses that you can think of?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Right! So basically Precursor itself came from a project that was originally called Betrusted. And the genesis of it was I actually did a research paper with Ed Snowden on the Introspection Engine, which was an attempt to convert an iPhone into a trustable device by monitoring its radios and saying, Okay well if the radio is not behaving in the way that I expect then the iPhone\u2019s been compromised and therefore you should burn it, break it, or throw it away. The outcome of that paper was that the iPhone was just too complex! There\u2019s too many false signals coming out that we couldn\u2019t create a reliable fool-proof trigger that wouldn\u2019t eventually make you just ignore all [the] alarms. The vendor itself would \u2014 you know, the iPhone would turn on even in Airplane Mode to do scans of the environment! We don\u2019t know why \u2014 apparently it\u2019s vendor-sanctioned behavior! Apple doesn\u2019t comment on it, but that\u2019s just how it is, right? So when you have this situation where vendors are doing things that are already sketchy and you can\u2019t \u2014 how are you supposed to find malware in that situation, right? So I thought about that for a long time and I was like, Look, we really need to solve the problem! And this is where I started arriving at the principles of simplicity, openness \u2014 these types of things. This is kind of the genesis of a lot of these principles was that effort. And so the direct target of that has always been supporting activists, journalists \u2014 people who are working in dangerous situations who need very high levels of security and they\u2019re up against state-level actors who have very little penalty for killing the person in question, and a lot of motivation to do it! We\u2019re talking about high-stakes poker here, right? [30:25] Which is why the Precursor design is so incredibly paranoid! And the goal was to make a product called Betrusted and we want it to be just out-of-the-box simple. Safe defaults \u2014 you didn\u2019t have to be a tech wizard to use it. Basically, if you had one of these devices [and] you could do a basic amount of inspection on it, you knew you were okay! Precursor came about because we got the hardware of that finished, but the software for it is still a long way off! Software, it turns out, is very hard, it\u2019s very complicated, and that\u2019s where all the bugs start to come in. That\u2019s where all the scary, unknowable complexities start to happen! And writing really good software that\u2019s simple, auditable, and understandable takes a very long time! And so we made the decision that there\u2019s other people in other communities who may benefit from a piece of hardware that\u2018s designed to this level of security and paranoia. For example, people who just want to manage passwords. People want authenticator tokens they can trust\u2014true second-factors. People want Bitcoin wallets. These types of things are applications that could probably use the same hardware platform that we\u2019ve created. And so we branded it Precursor to make it very clear that it is a predecessor\u2014it\u2019s a harbringer of other things. It\u2019s something that you add your code to [in order] to become that application. And that\u2019s why we bill it as an open source hardware development platform. It\u2019s not a product in and of itself! And the idea is: put it out there and maybe other communities will find things\u2014this is part of the reason why I\u2019m on your podcast! To let your people know about this possibility and maybe get interest and see what things I didn\u2019t expect could be useful to run on a platform like Precursor!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [33:25]: I\u2019m curious as well: so other people are interested in these kinds of things, they might also have looked at other projects like the Librem 5 or the PinePhone. How would Precursor distinguish from those kinds of projects?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: So the Librem 5 and the PinePhone \u2014 those are wonderful open source projects, and they do have open source down to the schematic level of the hardware. But there problem is [that] they still have the CPU problem that I described to you in that, like, We don\u2019t know what goes in \u2014 I think that they\u2019re ARM-based CPUs from vendors that don\u2019t share the source code of the CPU. So there\u2019s a layer there that they can\u2019t get into in terms of trust and reliability. And also they aren\u2019t on the reduced attack surface train \u2014 they\u2019re not about the simplified trust-inspectability. They\u2019re more looking to replace your full-featured smart phone with a device that has a better trustability aspect to it. But you still have the complexity problem in the devices. And that\u2019s a deliberate choice [that] users should be allowed to make! Like, I don\u2019t think that you can live your life practically in this complicated technological world with a device that is so simple that you could inspect it! There\u2019s just sort of like this Faustian choice that we have to make as humans: we don\u2019t have enough time in our lifetimes to learn all of technology, but we need to learn enough to be able to secure ourselves! So the dichotomy I\u2019m sort of approaching\u2014at least personally \u2014 what I do is, there\u2019s a certain set of things that I do on devices that I don\u2019t know if they have something on the inside! But it also doesn\u2019t matter! Like, why not? Browsers are convenient, Intel computers are cheap, let\u2019s go ahead and use these things and do day-to-day things that don\u2019t matter. But then the things that I really do care about \u2014 the things that are risky and high-value, I then put into this [other] device that I trust. That\u2019s the dichotomy that I\u2019m trying to move towards. So you actually would imagine a Librem or a PinePhone would work hand-in-hand with a Precursor device. You would actually carry both of them. One of them for your daily browser, and the other one for your security keys.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [35:29]: One thing I want to come back to is you were saying that a motivated attacker basically could probably find out where \u2014 reading secrets. But I saw that you plan as well to have a custom-made file system for the Precursor with plausible deniability. And actually that\u2019s a very familiar concept for Bitcoiners because with Bitcoiners, one thing they are doing to protect themselves from extraction of secrets directly from the device \u2014 is that they choose a password on top of it. So to get the private key you need basically what is written in the device plus this password, and the password is never stored. But the nice thing as well is that in our protocol, if you put a different password you get a different wallet, so that\u2019s how we use plausible deniability. If I understand you, you are doing it at the OS level, right?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie [36:24]: Yes! That\u2019s right. Absolutely. So to clarify, we also would fully intend that you would have password unlocks. We don\u2019t rely fully on the device\u2019s security for anything at the end of the day. So yes the secondary passwords are important, and yes, we also intend to implement a tree of passwords if you will. So that the secrets will unravel over time. And I said the software\u2019s really hard !\u2014 you know, plausible deniability is a very hard problem, and we are actually going all the way down to the file system level and re-implementing the file system to that even an attacker who has the ability to read your raw disk image out constantly could not tell that there were certain secrets on the inside. We make the free space of your disk look exactly like erased files. And so if you forget your password, you literally have deleted the file. It\u2019s literally the same operation. The operating system, to delete a file will\u2014if you request to do one \u2014 all it will do is just re-encrypt it to a random key and then delete the key. That\u2019s what it does, right? The other trick that we plan to do is that, instead of every file being like\u2014normally [when] you\u2019re managing a file it has a certain size, you open it, you scan through the file to position, you read it\u2014that\u2019s the story, like the positive extraction for a file. Our files are actually databases on the inside! So once you refer to them, you open them, they have keys and you can sort of query them for the contents. What this allows us to do is that as you type in more passwords to your system, we can actually merge in secure overlays. So your contact book\u2014when you type in your initial password \u2014 will just have your everyday contacts: your Mom, your girlfriend, whatever it is, things that everyone knows that you have, right? And then, if you type in another password, it actually can \u2014 across all your files, all your applications, add an overlay to it of that particular password-linked contacts. That\u2019s the goal! And so now in addition to that, you don\u2019t have to reload your applications or whatever it is, it\u2019s just [that] you now see a new set of chat history and new things just appear. When you clear that password \u2014 they go away. And you can have multiple passwords set. And so the idea is that at some point in time, if someone says, I force you to show me these passwords. You have to unlock your device for you to enter this country, and show me everything! You enter your passwords that you remember at the time, and you hand it to them, and that\u2019s it! They can\u2019t say that there are more passwords or not more passwords, they could do a low-level disk scan \u2014 they won\u2019t find any evidence that there\u2019s files that are not decrypted or there\u2019s things that aren\u2019t being accessed, because that\u2019s what the free space looks like! All the free space looks like a file that you might have forgotten the password to. That\u2019s kind of the way we\u2019re trying to structure the operating system, but it\u2019s really hard! Like this is actually a very hard cryptographic problem, and it\u2019s going to take a long time for us to write it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [38:57]: Yeah I was surprised that you do this because even like creating such a file system I will expect that it\u2019s a huge endeavor! I think the first one had been done by Julian Assange actually, if I am correct. But I think there has been many other [apps] then but I don\u2019t see any other that broke through. So I was surprised that basically you are developing that by yourself as well?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Our core team is on it! I spent the last 2 years developing the hardware. Hopefully the hardware stays relatively stable now, and the next 2 years I\u2019m gonna spend hashing out a lot of the software issues. There\u2019s another guy, Sean Cross, who\u2019s been absolutely instrumental. He\u2019s been writing all of the core OS stuff, and we have a couple other contributors who are working on the graphics and rendering side of things. We\u2019re hoping to get more of the community to start contributing to the software. But yeah it takes time! I mean this is just a full admission that this is hard to do and it takes time, which is why Precursor is a thing and Betrusted is not!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [40:00]: I think you really want developers to start using what you\u2019re doing, basically. And as a developer right now, I really want \u2014 imagine! \u2014 to make a Bitcoin wallet! Like, my only way right now for doing that will be to wait for the Precursor, right?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: I mean, there\u2019s a number of ways that you can do it! So Precursor in and of itself, we actually have a software emulator for it online, if you go to our repo and you look for https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core the operating system itself is written to run in what\u2019s called Hosted Mode, so you can either do it in a full hardware emulator or you can do it with half of it based in a UI rendering running on your machine. It\u2019s really primitive \u2014 all we have is message passing going on right now inside of it. But we\u2019re trying to facilitate some in that area early on. But you don\u2019t even have to use Xous, our operating system. At its core it\u2019s a RISC-V CPU, and you could port it to almost any other platform that you want! And I imagine more practically speaking, the early Bitcoin people probably don\u2019t want to wait for us to implement all of these fancy plausible deniability features and all of our fancy multi-lingual method inputs. Like we\u2019re putting a lot of effort in before we even get to the application level! In which case, I fully expect someone is just gonna port some RTOS to it or Linux or whatever it is and you\u2019re off to the races! It\u2019s like any other platform. The problem is that when you port one of those RTOSs to it, you\u2019re exposed to all of the vulnerabilities in those real-time operating systems! The trust level \u2014 they\u2019re pretty good actually! I mean honestly, they\u2019re probably okay, but we\u2019re writing everything for our system in Rust, so we get better guarantees on memory safety and whatnot. A lot of RTOSs are in C, so if you have buffer overruns\u2014good luck! There\u2019s these types of security properties that you have to deal with. Honestly if you want to port an RTOS, one I\u2019m very familiar with is called ChibiOS \u2014 you could probably do it in a couple, three days, if you\u2019re an experienced OS porter. And you could have enough functionality to build a Bitcoin wallet pretty simply on top of it! So I kind of expect that\u2019s what\u2019s gotta happen before we get to our level of security on our software side.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [42:10]: So in terms of the device, it doesn\u2019t have like a cellular modem, right? So it would be primarily out of the box, you would use it with Wi-Fi, or how would that part of it work? Or is mainly like you plug it in?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Yeah it has a Wi-Fi chip on the inside \u2014 it\u2019s hardware-firewalled. The intent is that if you want to use it on the go, you tether it to a phone or find a hotspot or something like this. There\u2019s a lot of reasons why we\u2019re avoiding a cellular modem on this dev. The system is architected so that later on if you want to extend to include a cellular modem or something like this \u2014 it can! From the standpoint of just holding really core to our principles of transparency, simplicity, supply chain management \u2014 all these types of things \u2014 the cellular modems have a lot of challenges in that area!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephen Livera [42:55]: If we\u2019re talking about it from a Bitcoin perspective, the user might be looking for ways to pass back and forth data \u2014 that might be a Bitcoin transaction to be signed \u2014 that kind of thing. Currently in the community, there\u2019s interest in using air-gapped methods, things like QR codes or Micro SD cards. Are there any ideas on how the device could be made either \u2014 maybe a camera is attached? Or is it more like it would be plugged in to transfer across the unsigned transaction, that kind of thing?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Yeah I think if you really want to do an air-gapped transfer, the easiest way to do it with the hardware that you have would be to modulate over the microphone. So it would still be plugged in via the microphone cable, like the headphone cable itself, you\u2019d plug something in by the audio. I guess you could also plug in an actual microphone itself and just hold it up to the speaker if you wanted to. But we actually have some experience doing air-gapped acoustic modulation of data, which I think is fast enough for Bitcoin transactions! You\u2019re not gonna send a movie with acoustic modulation, but a few hundred bits is not a problem!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [43:53]: Bitcoin transactions is between one hundred bytes and maximum one kilobyte, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s not good enough?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Yeah, we get rates \u2014 easily, it would take like 5 or 10 seconds to transfer something.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier: Another interesting property of doing this is that transferring data by Wi-Fi I guess it\u2019s relying on some chip that you cannot easily inspect, but I guess transmitting data via acoustic is way more basic"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Yeah that\u2019s right. The good news is that for the audio path, the entire audio path is in the trusted domain. Whereas, if we were to add a video camera, we would have to add a fairly complicated chip that we don\u2019t know anything about, that would have to process the video and whatnot. That being said, I did design the system so that a hacker could extend it maybe to put a camera on the inside. One of the thoughts I had is it would be nice to get QR codes if you want. They\u2019re convenient, they\u2019re fast, they\u2019re easy to use. Again, from the standpoint of just purity of the hardware, I didn\u2019t want to cross that boundary until we saw it. But the acoustic samples\u2014it\u2019s just an AD/DA converter. It\u2019s just a dumb analog to digital converter codec chip that we have, and then all the DSP happens inside the CPU. The good news is that we have \u2014 from a different, unrelated project \u2014 our team actually has a lot of experience with acoustic data modulation. For the pandemic, we were contracted to come up with some proposals for acoustic beacons for contact tracing for privacy conscious people. And so we created ultrasonic data transfer methods for getting bits of cryptographic data back and forth between two tokens at a range of one meter or so. You don\u2019t hear it, but the data can be transferred over that distance. And so we have that code base! And that\u2019s a thing that works over free space. We have to deal with all the background noise, and everything like this! If you plug it into a cable between your computer \u2014 and I would recommend doing that anyways, because why would you want to broadcast your Bitcoin transaction anyways over free space! Put it over a wire anyways! Even though a wire\u2019s a wire. But it should work quite well in terms of the data rates and the modulation.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Nicolas Dorier [46:03]: Oh! That\u2019s awesome! So there are tons of Bitcoin wallets in the market right now but there is nobody that has gone by this route of using acoustic data \u2014 it\u2019s very interesting!"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Yeah. The other cool thing about acoustic data modulation is that you can do it entirely browser-side. So you could have a Javascript program that can modulate it. And another sort of fun hack is that you could even conceiveably make a record. Like if you want to really hardcore store something \u2014 take the thing, burn it into record, burn it into the grooves of a record, and then you can play it back later on into your device by the record! It\u2019s a full analog reproduction of your digital data! Like you can just use a record needle plus the analog amps. No computer will touch your data! It\u2019s an archival format \u2014 so cool, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [46:52]: It\u2019s like those stenographic techniques where they encode something into an image kind of thing but even crazier. You mentioned also the trusted domain and an untrusted domain. Can you just touch on that part for a little bit?"}
{"prompt": "Bunnie: Yeah. There\u2019s what\u2019s inside the box and there\u2019s what\u2019s outside the box. And obviously for the device to interact with the rest of the world, we have to have something that touches the outside world, and that\u2019s the untrusted domain. So the untrusted domain is basically a set of firewalls and circuitry to \u2014 we worry about things like power emission side-channels and attack surfaces through USB, attack surfaces through Wi-Fi, and so that when we talk about untrusted domain we have these set of chips that focus the attack surface down to an innumerable set of signals that we can think about, reason about, and test. And those funnel them into the trusted domain which \u2014 as its name implies \u2014 that\u2019s where all the action happens! Where all the private keys and everything is located. And the trusted domain is what you actually want to audit and make sure everything is working correctly. And the untrusted domain helps make sure that the rest of the world can\u2019t get an accidental side-channel or some insight into what\u2019s happening inside the trusted domain.

{"prompt": "Nicolas Dorier: So in the Bitcoin community, most developers are more on the software side rather than the hardware side. Except a few individuals.

And basically he\u2019s doing this hardware construction, he\u2019s documenting everything. But the problem is \u2014because we are mostly software developers \u2014 we are still immature in the way to open source what we\u2019re doing at the hardware level.

There\u2019s actually a certification process. You can actually register your design with the OSHA and get an actual certification number for your design as being compliant to those standards. But basically it involves releasing the schmatics and the circuit board design in a format that is one that\u2019s also editable, but one that\u2019s also readable. It\u2019s a little bit tricky in the hardware world because there are still a lot of proprietary design tools still in use. And that\u2019s just the reality of it. There is just not enough investment in the hardware realm to have a full open source stack all the way down to the chips. It\u2019s just not there yet. They\u2019re working on it! But we\u2019re getting there."}
{"prompt": "Nicolas Dorier [49:58]: But one way of doing that is like, when you are creating your PCB you\u2019re using some of those proprietary tools. But out of it you\u2019re producing some artifacts like for example BOM, Bill of Materials. You can generate the Bill of Materials but the Bill of Materials can be just in text form so like other people can easily review it. Or even for the schematic actually, the schematic could be exported in SVG. It becomes way easier to collaborate between people! But right now it\u2019s not really [widespread] right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bunnie: Yeah I can\u2019t remember off the top of my head what the OSHWA\u2018s specific implementation is, but I always ship my schematics both in the native tool format and in PDF format so that anyone who just wants to read it can look at it without a special tool. But then someone who is a hardware designer and has the tools can also edit it without having to laboriously copy and reproduce all the schematics and make mistakes along the way!"}
{"prompt": "Nicolas Dorier [51:01]: Yeah but basically what you are doing is you make your hardware there, you have this fixed design and then you upload it following this standard. But like you said, Precursor is kind of like a developer board, so what will happen I guess from when you would ship it, is that people will build their own customized Precursor by changing some part of the hardware or like whatever [they\u2019re] doing. But by doing that basically it\u2019s a more collaborative approach. It\u2019s not like they develop everything on their side and then ship it at the end and then never touch it again. I think it will be more in need of collaboration between hardware developers. Also, having a way to compare different designs like, Oh, how [is] my Precursor that I modified with my own stuff different from the original one? I understand that you have already this kind of tool that when you are finished building you can present it in a proper way, but you also need this back and forth collaboration!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bunnie [51:54]: Yeah. The collaborative aspect of hardware is still a work in progress. There\u2019s a number of services currently trying to create like the GitHub for hardware \u2014 that type of thing. There\u2019s a lot of challenges actually to really making hardware extremely collaborative, and a lot of it boils down to the exact same problem that we were talking about earlier of the whole, What is this individual unit in your hand mean relative to the reference design? A classic problem in hardware is that even my design files \u2014 the ones that I create \u2014 are not synchronized with what goes into the assembly machine on the factory floor! And the reason is that the manufacturer themselves will oftentimes modify it to improve the manufacturability of the design. So very simple example is if I\u2019m trying to cut a piece of metal, and I specify a square edge on it \u2014 the cutting bit is round! You can\u2019t get a perfect square corner on that cut. So the manufacturer will make a modification \u2014 either they will add an extra drill point, or they\u2019ll actually round out the corner, whatever it is \u2014 you don\u2019t get exactly what was in your CAD file. And so what happens is I actually have to go through, send it to the manufacturer, they have to go through their drill bench and then feed back to me what the standard radiuses are\u2014this whole process, and then taking all that back. If someone wants to truly reproduce an exact copy of that design, it\u2019s actually quite hard! There\u2019s these very small subtleties! And it\u2019s like, you don\u2019t have this problem in the software world, because one you compile something, that\u2019s it!"}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [53:22]: So it\u2019s deterministic.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bunnie: Yeah it\u2019s deterministic \u2014 it\u2019s done! Like it actually comes down to literally the details of the CNC machine that\u2019s working on that metal case that impart almost a sort of texture onto the case itself. And so these are some of the unique challenges in the hardware world in terms of collaboration. So that\u2019s one sort of extreme example. So you can just imagine now, when you\u2019re at that level of\u2014one hardware guy just patches on some blue wires on something and makes a new version! How do you capture that on the schematic? You know, those flying wires. How do you annotate that? Literal patches need to be communicated. So there\u2019s a lot of challenges there! But, in principle, and what I really do hope is that someone does take Precursor and someone in the Bitcoin community is like, Oh we really need this camera and we\u2019re totally okay with the attack surface of the camera, which is completely fine \u2014 you can add it in and make your own version with a camera! I actually designed it so that it\u2019s relatively trivial. Like you could almost take the base unit: 99% of the design is the same, and you just have to modify a couple components to mount a camera in there, write some software, and then you have a very different function device! So the hardware itself, Precursor itself, is modularly designed to facilitate this sort of community growth. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna evolve! I can\u2019t predict what people will do, what they like, what they don\u2019t like. But oftentimes what happens is it starts with a need. Someone has an itch that they have to scratch \u2014 I\u2019m the closest thing to scratching it \u2014 and they just want to hack whatever into it, and I try to give them easier places to hack that hopefully will make it easier for the rest of the community to pull it back in. But you know? People surprise me all the time! They come up with elaborate ways that are much harder than it would be. And then it\u2019s hard to share it back and then we have to talk to each other and then have a conversation and be engineers and humans and respect each other and figure out how to build a community, right? But that\u2019s the essence of community building at the end of the day!"}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [55:11]: Right. Building off that point you were just making there, is it also a question here that it\u2019s the size of this market right now? It may be that right now most people are complacent\u2014they\u2019re not really that interested in this ideal of verifying for yourself, of having at least the ability to do so \u2014 how does that change if, let\u2019s say, Bitcoin gets a lot bigger and a lot more people are interested in this kind of thing. What kinds of changes would we see in terms of how these devices are manufactured and designed and things like that? How much bigger do you think the market would have to get before this becomes a more viable thing for a typical user, as opposed to the more hardcore technical user?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bunnie [55:52]: Yeah. I guess this conflates two aspects: one is the security aspect and one of the open source aspect. From a security standpoint, I will fully admit, Precursor takes one of the most extreme positions you can get in terms of trustability and security \u2014 we make a lot of usability sacrifices in the name of absolute trust. That\u2019s because the threat model is so severe! We really took it to an extreme in terms of designing it. Which means that in practice, a more mass-adopted unit will have more features and have more attack surfaces, but you have to find that balance! On the other hand, if we don\u2019t move the goal posts all the way to the end of the field, we\u2019ll never know where it ends! So that\u2019s the idea, is to do that! So I think it\u2019ll probably be at some point in the mass-adoption curve where we realize some things are really important \u2014 like we want to know about our CPU, we want to know about our key store \u2014 and other things probably aren\u2019t as important like the camera or the cellular radio interfaces. We can contain those, right? Those are not actual attack surfaces, just theoretical attack surfaces. And then in terms of the trustability and reliability of the hardware, I mean the open source aspect\u2014the ability to look at it and say what\u2019s there or not \u2014 that will be driven more by\u2014it\u2019s almost a cat and mouse game! In an ideal world, obviously you just\u2014everyone keeps their word! And then there\u2019s no demand for any of this, right? In the security world \u2014 and this is where the dirty secrets of being in the security world [are] \u2014 is that, security experts drive both the supply and the demand for their trade. So if a security expert is not having enough work defending computers, they go into the business of making exploits, which then creates demand for their \u2014 they\u2019re actually one of the few trades that can sort of legally control supply and demand for their efforts right now, right? In a way, what the demand for this sort of open hardware stuff will depend a bit on [is] what we find out in the wild! If it turns out that in practice no one ever finds Bitcoin valuable to go ahead and do a supply chain exploit to steal $10 Million worth of Bitcoin, then there will be no demand for this type of thing! But I think once you actually get a well documented case out in the wild\u2014this is what happened. You both get the lesson, you get not a theoretical thing, but actually a real thing and this has happened and people are like, Okay, well you gotta avoid that! This is essential! That you have to have this standard of inspectability, otherwise you\u2019re vulnerable to this! Then I think people take it more seriously. But unfortunately, human behavior is really bad at doing things that are just good for them, because \u2014 going to the gym, eating well, getting exercise \u2014 very hard for people to do! Because it\u2019s sort of all this preventative maintenance type of thing. Whereas once you have a very immediate feedback that something is bad, people have a much easier time of doing something about it. So the market for open hardware and inspectability and are they gonna be exploits inside of my hardware and how important is it to open it up and this reproducability \u2014 I think it\u2019s gonna depend in part upon what the adversaries do! The other potential outcome maybe is that we have \u2014 and this would be the ideal: we\u2019re all holding hands and rainbows in the world \u2014 we have such a fecund and diverse innovation ecosystem around this, the modularity and everyone\u2019s developing this, these open hardware designs are just desirable because we\u2019re [all] so productive and so interesting, right? I wish we could get there but I\u2019m not holding my breath for that outcome. It\u2019s usually driven more by fear than by inspiration and hope."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [59:11]: So I guess the realistic answer then is: someone has to get pwned for a lot of money before people start taking it more seriously!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bunnie: I mean come on! I\u2019ll tell you, a Forbes article about someone being pwned for a lot of money because of a supply attack would be like \u2014 we\u2019d talk about it for the next decade!"}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera: Alright Bunnie well look I know we spent about 60 minutes so we want to respect your time but before we let you go can you just give the listeners an update where you\u2019re at with Precursor fundraising and for anybody who wants to support you or take part in it \u2014 how can they get involved and follow you?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Bunnie: Precursor itself you can go to precursor.dev. We just closed crowdfunding in December. You can still pre-order units, which means that it\u2019s a slightly higher price right now than the crowdfunding, but you can get one. You can get in the queue for one! And we hope to ship later this year. At this very moment actually we\u2019re in really great shape. We\u2019ve got all the certification ready, all the prototypes put into the pipe. We\u2019re working against the Chinese New Year\u2019s deadline. We have a lot of suppliers all over the world and a lot of them are in Asia so we have to give them all these prototypes before Chinese New Year\u2019s. We\u2019re on track to get\u2014when I say certification ready I\u2019m talking about electromagnetic compliance, this is the FCC\u2019s CE sort of stamps I have to have to import to the EU and the rest of the world. We\u2019re in good shape to get those certifications and so I\u2019m very optimistic at the moment that with the pandemic vaccine coming around and whatnot maybe the supply chain will stabilize a bit and we won\u2019t have as much surprises as last year. bunnie is my Twitter, or check our Precursor.dev and that will land you at all of our stuff including GitHub. All of our GitHub is unfortunately at a slightly counter-intuitive URL. It\u2019s betrusted-io is our GitHub, but that\u2019s because we originated with a project called Betrusted."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: Great! Thanks for having me Cedric!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: This is so awesome! I enjoyed the book tremendously, it\u2019s really a hallmark for me this year. It made me look at things a lot differently. And I\u2019m curious what have you made of the reaction to the book since it came out in January?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [01:48]: I\u2019ve been blown away! It\u2019s turned into a bestseller in multiple countries, it\u2019s being translated into a whole bunch of different languages for distribution in other markets. That was completely unexpected! I thought it would be \u2014 when I wrote it, I was actually really worried about the fallout from it. Anytime you go against an existing system that has so much inertia and everything else, and you\u2019re going up against an entire system that we take for granted that we live in! Quite honestly I was really concerned about what that would look like! What that would look like for my family \u2014 everything else. Because normally, even if you\u2019re right on something like that, the world doesn\u2019t want to look at something. So it\u2019s been an amazing ride, largely unexpected.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [02:56]: Touching on the concern, I kind of think of you as this CEO\u2019s CEO. You\u2019re on numerous boards \u2014 I\u2019m sure you get asked to be on hundreds of boards every year \u2014 and so you\u2019re really connected! And I wonder, how much of your concern was sharing your thoughts of \u2014 you know, you\u2019re thinking behind the scenes! Because you are influencing a lot of enterprises and companies and individuals who drive those companies! Was that a concern from a business perspective as well?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [03:27]: So before I started writing this book, I had this conversation with my wife. And I said, Listen, we don\u2019t need this! Right? Wealthy, have a lot of access, I\u2019m sitting on all of these boards, lot of ownership in a raft of technology companies. And if anything, writing this book puts all of that at risk! Because it\u2019s going up against a system and if I turn into a pariah from going up against the system, people can\u2019t have me on their boards! It could actually hurt a lot of our economic well-being and everything else. So it was that kind of conversation with my wife, but I said, But I still have to do it! It is \u2014 so, yes! Very much! But again, all the boards that I sit on, or all of the technology entrepreneurs that I\u2019m helping, if you actually go down to the root of what they\u2019re doing, most of them aren\u2019t starting a company to say, I\u2019m going to make the most money and I win the game! Most of them are starting a company to say, How do I create a whole bunch of value for society? And so in that\u2014and using technology differently to create a whole bunch of value \u2014 is what they\u2019re really doing! And so I wouldn\u2019t be on any board that didn\u2019t actually think about, How do I create a whole bunch of value for society? So even though it could look like this, I think I pretty much knew any of the people I work with would back 100%.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [05:18]: Sure. So let\u2019s get into the book! I think we agree: we\u2019re in the age of inflation, but I think we should start there! I don\u2019t know if you get asked this question too often or not enough but\u2014what is inflation?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: The simplest explanation is when your money is worth less over time! So it has different winners/losers: if your money is worth less over time, then debt gets less expensive over time because you pay it back with cheaper money tomorrow. So if you hold a lot of debt, inflation is a really good thing. If you hold assets, inflation takes those assets up with it. But it\u2019s also really bad for money or people that are on fixed income, because it\u2019s losing money!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [06:14]: And how would you explain deflation?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: It\u2019s the opposite side of that coin. So your money is worth more over time. Goods and services go down in price related to that money. And so, Cedric, in that conversation there\u2019s a whole of bunch of people \u2014 less people that have read my book \u2014 they\u2019re starting to understand this! And a lot of people are starting to understand this construct. But money is just a construct, and inflation is just a construct we believe in! And we set up the rules that it\u2019s always a good thing without even questioning, Is it a good thing? There\u2019s a whole bunch of people \u2014 you\u2019re taught in school that we have to have inflation! Where central banks come out and say, We desperately \u2014 we have to have 2% inflation, it\u2019s so good for society! And that\u2019s kind of that scratching at something that we\u2019ve always been taught to be true \u2014 might just not be true! That breaks your brain! And so okay, Why is your money going down in value a good thing? Why is that universally a good thing? Maybe it\u2019s not!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [07:32]: Right! So I just re-read the book, and the first time I read it was probably in March or April, and looking back on it it feels like 10 years ago! And re-reading it now I say to myself, If I was reading this 10 years ago I would be so optimistic I would be running out of the room screaming, looking for ways to take a lot of the ideas you put forth around technology and getting involved! And now having gone through the year, I\u2019m a little less optimistic, because 2020 is what it is, and it\u2019s still the opposite of \u2014 you know, coming into the year and reading this book I thought, This idea\u2019s in hand! We\u2019re gonna handle things differently. And we\u2019ve not doubled down [in the wrong direction] \u2014 we\u2019ve gone 10X I feel like."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [08:18]: So it\u2019s amazing how many people do exactly what you\u2019re saying! Read the book, then read it again, then read it again, then read it again! Because what we\u2019re talking about here is it changes your thinking from one system to another system! But we measure all of our outcomes from an existing system, so it\u2019s really hard for our brains to comprehend what a new system could look like! And so I explore some of that in the book. But I think to what your point is, is I laid out in the book how technology was exponentially deflationary, or it created exponential efficiency, and that efficiency was deflationary. And it was going up against a monetary system that required inflation! And so you could expect exponential monetary easing on the other side. And all that COVID did is accelerated what I\u2019m talking about! It\u2019s just accelerated \u2014 technology is moving faster! I think a lot of people think that technology is an industry, instead of, It\u2019s the base layer of everything that we\u2019re doing!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Like a first principle!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [09:36]: Yeah! But more of a \u2014 if you think about the rest of the world in this industry and this industry and this industry, and they think, Okay, technology is its own industry! Let\u2019s measure technology. In fact, you can\u2019t measure productivity gains out of something that moves to free! That we still measure productivity gains in all of the language: that we want to see GDP go up, but how does GDP go up from free photos? How does that happen? So a whole bunch of our constructs in measuring the existing system are wrong! Completely wrong! Because technology is moving in the base layer of everything that we\u2019re doing. This video conference we\u2019re on, we couldn\u2019t have done this 20 years ago!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [10:31]: Right. I mean I see this in my own life with just podcasting, the hardware has come down in price, the software is providing everything for free that they used to pay a technician to help provide for you or something of that sort. And you point a lot of things out on the book, especially at the beginning, it set the framework and to get our heads around exponentiality. And you talk about governments printing trillions of dollars and trying to understand that 1 trillion seconds is equal to 31,709 years! Just to kind of give some perspective! And you have an anecdote about having dinner with your friend Chen Fong, and you mention having dinner with his parents and them kind of getting a little nervous about what\u2019s happening. And they mention this quip around: first currency wars, then trade wars, and then real wars! Where do you think we are in that sort of parable of thought, or are we not in that moment?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [11:31]: We\u2019re absolutely in that! And so again, if people could see that all of the pricing of everything around them is just an illusion out of money printing \u2014 and that\u2019s hard to see \u2014 but if my thesis [in the book] was right, that technology is driving exponentially more efficiency, then something on the other side of that ledger should prove that thesis correct! So in the beginning of the book I talked about, We have $250 Trillion of debt to run an $80 Trillion global economy. And those numbers are so staggering! But you could say\u2014if you believed in fairy tales \u2014 you could say maybe we can grow our way out of it. If there\u2019s new industries created, then we could grow our way out of it. If it was just status quo. But taxes would have to go up to grow our way out of it. Right? We\u2019d have to pay back the debt. And the debt is such a staggering number. But then when you realize $185 Trillion of that debt has come over the last 20 years, you see the smoking gun! So, thesis: Technology is driving this, everything is more efficient\u2014deflation. And massive amounts of easing \u2014 exponentially more \u2014 each year are needed to try to stop that, to pretend we still live in an inflationary world! So okay, now what\u2019s the consequence? That\u2019s looking backwards, that\u2019s to 2019. So looking forwards, if technology is still moving exponentially, you have to expect that that $185 Trillion looks like child\u2019s play looking backwards compared to what\u2019s needed looking forwards to stop that, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing! Now, in that game, because again \u2014 we don\u2019t measure these things at a system level \u2014 we measure them by independent variables. We look at our housing, we say, Housing always goes up! And fail to ask, would housing have gone up without $185 Trillion of liquidity? Extra liquidity, over the last 20 years? And the simple answer is, No, housing is mispriced! Massively mispriced! As everything else is! Because of that liquidity, that easing pulling forward demand. So the next question is, how long can that continue? But not just continue $100 Trillion more over many years \u2014 exponentially more? To be able to fight the other force of technological deflation! And so, it can continue! If governments can continue printing\u2014resetting their currencies \u2014 essentially devaluing their currencies forever, then it can continue! Because really what they\u2019re doing is, they\u2019re pouring money into a hole. But when you change the rules of what money is by making up new money, somebody loses on the other side of that bet! And there\u2019s a whole bunch of losers on the other side of that bet, including anybody on fixed wages. And so you see revolution in wars emerging as the number one threat to society, because you\u2019re manipulating this. So everything is mispriced \u2014 everything! It\u2019s not natural! But we all live in that mispriced world, and we know it\u2019s going to be more mispriced going forward, and so a whole bunch of the wealthy try to put their money in assets that are going to take advantage of that mispricing. They\u2019re making good decisions in a world gone crazy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [15:58]: When did your thesis start to really form for you? For myself I remember in college getting my finance degree and long-term capital management was when the framework for me kind of broke. I didn\u2019t form a thesis around it and write a book, but in 2006\u20132007 I had returned home to suburbia Long Island, from San Francisco. And I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood: lots of teachers, plumbers, electricians\u2014people in those fields can do very well! But I would walk around and everybody had new siding and brand new $30,000 cars and you can tell that this was all financed through debt. And this was all 2006\u20132007 and then 2008 we have the great financial crisis. And recently you spoke in front of the House of Commons, and this is kind of the reason I brought this up, maybe those events and government. And also when I was in grad school we studied a lot of accounting fraud, and most of the accounting fraud examples that we studied, the fines never really amounted to anything near the gains from the fraud that usually settled in a no-fault agreement. So one side could argue they were just being aggressive. And so with that underpinning, How much fraud do you think is in Fortune 500 companies? Or the S&P 500? And when did you start to formulate this thesis around debt and the black hole?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [17:30]: So just realizing that this was a system change. Now remember, in any system change, they cannot work together! An inflationary monetary policy is incongruent with where technology is going. Technology tries to make everything cheaper, more abundant, and inflationary monetary policy does the opposite. These are forces that are competing against each other \u2014 the only way they can co-exist is with concentration of power by the state. Essentially destroying all free markets. That\u2019s the only way they can co-exist: if people believed in a fairy tale of money and government power forever, and saying, Okay you make all the decisions for me! Then they can co-exist! That would look pretty dystopian. That would look like what China\u2019s trying to do with the currency control. But otherwise these things cannot co-exist! So that was the realization: the technology. When I saw that every single business that I was involved in \u2014 my first business cost me almost $5 Million to create the technology platform, that Shopify today does for $50 a month! And Shopify\u2019s platform today is like 100 times better than what I created over 2 years with $5 Million. It\u2019s the point of technology! It reduces prices and increases abundance! So Kodak going broke\u2014it\u2019s not like we use less photos today. The number of photos is staggering that we use today! And storage has collapsed in price! Everything has collapsed in price along that same axis! [19:47] We have all of that abundance! We have it in our phones! We have it in everything we do! So if it\u2019s moving at that pace, why is everything going up in price? It forces you to ask kind of just a first principle question and saying, It shouldn\u2019t be! And with that you find the smoking gun. And then you realize \u2014 Oh my god!\u2014how much credit is being created out of thin air! What that means, and all of the repercussions to society \u2014 Oh my god! And there\u2019s a reset coming! It can come in a number of different forms, but there is a reset coming!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [20:36]: What do you think is the key to bringing on that reset sooner than later, hopefully in a more positive way?

And I say that with maybe positive or negative connotations. And how long"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [21:00]: I recently had a call from editor in chief of one of the major papers. And I\u2019m not gonna say which one at this point because there\u2019s gonna be pieces coming out in time. But he said to me, I read your book last year and it was impossible to disagree with any of it! And I sent it to some top people in government, finance and everything \u2014 Blackstone \u2014 the works. And got back: We have to keep printing. Not, This is wrong! We have to keep printing. And what he said to me over a couple hour conversation is he said, We in media are not doing our job, because everybody is going back to the exact same people saying, How do we solve this? And the exact same people are creating the mess! Now they\u2019re stuck \u2014 now he didn\u2019t say this, it\u2019s what I said \u2014 it\u2019s not bad actors, not invariably all bad people! You could change an actor in a system and it won\u2019t change the system! They are stuck in a system that cannot be solved from the existing system \u2014 it\u2019s impossible! It\u2019s actually mathematically impossible to solve. It\u2019s like \u2014 and I use this example in the book \u2014 it\u2019s like Blockbuster solving Netflix from their stores. It\u2019s impossible! Two totally different systems! And they can\u2019t be solved. So that\u2019s why Bitcoin is advancing so fast! And actually the best chance for a peaceful transition is Bitcoin! That\u2019s a bold statement but I believe it to be true, because it\u2019s a forcing function that is a different system. System change very rarely comes from within. And what we\u2019re seeing is, name somebody right now \u2014 try to find somebody who doesn\u2019t want more easing? Whether it\u2019s more printing for the Left or the Right, I\u2019m gonna make up money for these people, I\u2019m gonna make up money for these people \u2014 there is no free market anymore! It\u2019s gone! And everybody requires \u2014 and if there isn\u2019t any easing, the system would collapse, asset prices would collapse by 90%, homelessness everywhere, banking failure around the globe, and it would be a hard reset, and then it would be reformed in some new system on the other side. That\u2019s what would happen today! [23:55] So it\u2019s no wonder in that policy environment you have governments \u2014 every one of them \u2014 trying to out-print each other! Because they know that that\u2019s true! And every time, they make the system more fragile, but the question is: what would you have them do? There\u2019s a whole bunch of population that \u2014 because they created this problem and didn\u2019t know they were creating it, trying to outrun it, grow the way they\u2019ve always grown, this tiny little bit of inflation will manipulate markets more open, and then it got more and more and more as technology was going the other way \u2014 now we\u2019re way too late! What would you have them do?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [24:37]: Is part of the race to win printing the most money? And then be forgiven on repayment?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: So again what ends up happening in that is, if you can create money out of nothing \u2014 so what do you think is happening in the geopolitical game today? What\u2019s happening between the US and China? So China realized that, Wait! We can do this too! If I create a digital Yuan \u2014 if I get people to take this \u2014 I built a road in Africa [for example]. If I get people to take my thing that I can just make up out of thin air, and then they can pay me back, I control them through a debt instrument, rather than force! I control them through economic means rather than force, and they have to play by my rules! But when there\u2019s multiple countries all doing the exact same thing, you can kind of see where that goes!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [25:43]: Looking at China, do you think a state like China \u2014 does it fail because it\u2019s human-led? And it\u2019s centralized and eventually it crumbles on itself because they end up making bad decisions? How much do you think there\u2019s a potential for them to succeed and continue to export central banking colonialism and social media surveillance?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [26:11]: If Bitcoin doesn\u2019t win, then China might win. It\u2019s that \u2014 because if central banks try to do that, then each central bank is gonna control their citizens through that, and then the central banks are gonna try to make their digital currencies stronger against other currencies in trading blocs, from their digital currencies all fighting and playing that same game. Bitcoin solves that. In fact, I think Bitcoin happened faster \u2014 I think if the US goes and embraces it\u2014which is much higher likelihood, because if you look at the US Constitution and everything else, it was all around rights and freedoms of the individual, which created innovation, strong economy \u2014 everything else! And now it\u2019s moving far away from that, but I suspect that if any country could embrace what Bitcoin stands for, it\u2019s actually going to be the US, and you can see in some of the regulation, it\u2019s actually moving that way! But if that happens, it\u2019s kind of checkmate for China\u2019s digital Yuan. It\u2019s a forcing function for that as well. It\u2019s actually probably the best thing geopolitically that could happen. I\u2019m careful on some of these things because these are all probability events, and you\u2019re dealing with something that has such a magnitude on all of our lives, that it\u2019s bound to not be a straight line. There\u2019s gonna be some thrashing back and forth, different policies and everything else. When you hear things like \u2014 The Great Reset \u2014 spoken from multiple different politicians all at the same time, realize that there\u2019s a whole bunch of stuff happening behind that conversation to be able to say, Here\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna talk about it. So that Great Reset is probably different governments coming together and creating a different unit of currency, unit of account, to try to bring this back together. What\u2019s great about a reset and what you\u2019re doing and what people are doing is, emboldening more government control. That\u2019s what\u2019s happening. Or when you hear \u2014 Build Back Better \u2014 when you hear all these things. Now if it was one institution \u2014 I am not for conspiracy theories, this is actors in a system doing their best to protect the system\u2014but, when you hear something from multiple different places, there\u2019s coordination happening behind the scenes on this. When you think about \u2014 and I\u2019ve said this numerous times as well, and I say it because no one else is saying it! \u2014 wherever you are on the environmental climate change discussion, realize that all governments today talking about climate change because people believe it\u2019s such a big deal \u2014 and it is, it\u2019s a big deal \u2014 and they say, We\u2019re gonna invest in solving climate change and we\u2019re gonna print more money to be able to solve climate change. Think of that oxymoron! Because you can\u2019t! The existing system can\u2019t solve climate change!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I love how you point this out as the biggest problem of climate!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: Yes it\u2019s an order of magnitude bigger problem \u2014 on climate \u2014 than anything else.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: It\u2019s an amazing connection!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [30:27]: Right. Because if you\u2019re in the system, if you lower price and create green energy, then the system needs to manipulate currency more to disrupt your game. So the existing system cannot solve climate change. It is climate change! And, what ends up happening is, most of the participants in the system believe people saying, Here\u2019s why we need to create more money to be able to help you.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [31:00]: Before we turn to more technology, I really wanted to dive into what you bring up in the book there. In terms of people in government \u2014 and it\u2019s not so much a conspiracy theory \u2014 it\u2019s people acting with rational incentives and trying to figure out best solutions within the framework that they\u2019ve been presented. And it is a system that maybe overarches people\u2019s abilities to turn the boat around. But how much of it do you think is rational incentives in the system maybe now \u2014 meaning, I might be encouraged to make the pie smaller so that my slice of the pie gets bigger, versus, Let\u2019s grow the pie for everyone and for the benefit of humanity and more that optimistic view of what to do with the choices at hand?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [31:47]: You know from the book, I talked about game theory and incentives and what we think. And in a book like that I had to cover a lot of ground and simplify these things to make it consumable so people can put the picture together. But some of these things\u2014if you take game theory \u2014 really what you\u2019re saying is, I\u2019m gonna care about my family first \u2014 me first. We don\u2019t think about everyone else in every interaction. Most times we think about what we are individually. We look at our own photos, we look at our own media, we constantly reinforce me, me, me, me, me. Then it\u2019s our family. Then it\u2019s our friends and community. Then it\u2019s nation states. And all of these things are just how people think. Not good, not bad, not anything else. It\u2019s really, really hard to go the other way and say, I\u2019m gonna think about everybody and not me! So when you think about game theory and everything else and these incentives, just go back to that and say, If you have a choice \u2014 you individually have a choice\u2014use Bitcoin as an example, it\u2019s what\u2019s driving it too: I can go in right now and I can protect me and my family and gain a whole bunch of wealth. It\u2019d be a rational decision. Then you think about the next level, then you think about the next level, then you think about the next level, and all of these things are just in concert: if I can buy a house now, get in now before everybody else is in and it\u2019s gonna go up, you don\u2019t need more and more of these things! Or, you need some of them to live, but they\u2019re all rational decisions individually, to be able to take more advantage. And when the system is gamed \u2014 when the entire system is gamed \u2014 you can expect a lot more of that to happen!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [34:08]: I agree. My son always turns to me and he\u2019s kind of like, When are we getting some new technology? And I\u2019m always like, There\u2019s new technology every day! You\u2019re using it! It\u2019s coming out all the time! And he\u2019s like, No, no, no. When are things gonna get bigger, better, different. Something like a new \u2014 I mean for him that means like a new Nintendo Switch or some sort of new evolution to the things that he\u2019s looking at. But what I\u2019m getting at here is, you\u2019ve touched on a lot of \u2014 with your work \u2014 you\u2019ve gotten a lot of opportunities to look at technology. And not that technology is one thing, and so I want to break it up into different verticals of different aspects of technology that\u2019s been coming out and been talked about for years: self-driving cars, artificial intelligence. Let\u2019s start with self-driving cars: how fast is this coming about? How much can this enhance our economy and our lives? Or is this more of a 20\u201330 year thing?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [35:18]: So instead of focusing on anyone \u2014 because on the immediate time-frame on this \u2014you\u2019ll be wrong by a year or two on any immediate one. And actually by the way, that\u2019s a concept that a number of people mistook the book for, because recency bias \u2014 which we all have \u2014 will look at the existing events right now and discount what\u2019s happening underneath. So some people looked at the artificial intelligence chapter and everything else \u2014 by the way, there is nothing in the artificial intelligence chapter that is not true from first principles, and I\u2019m very close to it! I\u2019m very close to it! So what\u2019s happening in that realm? In some of the different research and different pieces that take deep learning to probabilistic program to other things, to eventually the singularity where computers are smarter than all humans\u2014is a thing and it\u2019s a big thing! Now what people are looking for and what you just asked is, When does the light switch? And that\u2019s the thing that is so crazy \u2014 not the question, but because we\u2019re in the system, we think about it as, Okay, when will everything change, and all jobs go away? And that\u2019s not the point! The point is that it\u2019s actually more and more deflationary, it\u2019s more and more efficient all the way along, until one day it\u2019s completely free! It just keeps on getting more efficient! And so there doesn\u2019t need to be a light switch! The other thing that you asked is, When is our economy better because of that? It\u2019s not! It\u2019s continually worse, because it\u2019s competing against that system! And so people are looking for more and more jobs out of this, and they don\u2019t realize that more inflation to get more and more jobs \u2014 the opposite side of the coin of inflation is wage deflation. So you\u2019re holding onto jobs by making the jobs less of a component of the overall picture by making labor cheaper. And you\u2019re tricking society into doing that so they\u2019re working over and over and over in a job that\u2019s not required anymore, that otherwise would have gone away because technology would have removed it. But if the job went away and you forced prices this high, everybody fails! And they\u2019re scared to death that they can\u2019t eat, they can\u2019t house themselves, everything else, because they\u2019re measuring a system that is so overpriced, that requires prices to continually go up, and their wages are going down in that and it\u2019s getting worse and worse and worse. Whereas, if you actually let nature take its course \u2014 I\u2019m not talking about the transition, the transition is difficult \u2014 if you let nature take its course, prices would fall so fast on everything! And they would keep falling, keep falling, keep falling, to free. They would just keep on going down, and you would get the abundance without the game that\u2019s being played!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [38:41]: Let\u2019s take the economy out of it and let\u2019s say we\u2019ve gone through the reset, or we don\u2019t go through the reset \u2014 regardless of the reset. You know, I listened to a conversation between Peter Thiel and Eric Weinstein where they talked about how it sometimes feels like things haven\u2019t changed much since the 1970\u2019s. And I think you answered my question already though where in the sense that, I already look at my iPhone as an extension of my brain. And I get what you\u2019re saying in the sense that there\u2019s not gonna be a switch where we go from that moment to, it\u2019s embedded in my body somewhere and just giving me more information. It\u2019s just gonna be gradually! But you were talking about the Yeezy was being printed out of liquid with 3D printing and additive manufacturing, and I\u2019m just kind of curious \u2014 again, economy aside \u2014 when might those things be more prevalent? I guess I\u2019m not asking for when, but do you think those things are coming at us?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [39:53]: Way faster than people imagine! So, \u201cThe future\u2019s already here, it\u2019s just not evenly distributed.\u201d William Gibson! But when you see\u2014what I\u2019m fortunate enough to be able to see in a whole bunch of this \u2014 it\u2019s already here! It\u2019s just not evenly distributed! Why is it not evenly distributed? Because some of it\u2019s coming out of the labs. Some of it\u2019s attacking \u2014 if you use 3D additive manufacturing, where would that start? It would probably start in the most expensive industries as it gains traction before it got to us. So just have your listeners go and look at how many airplane parts are created out of additive manufacturing and you\u2019ll see how fast this is moving! And as that reduces its price and increases its efficiency, additive manufacturing gets better and better and it moves into society. So it makes sense that these industries, technology moves in \u2014 it starts in industries that are high cost, reducing prices there first, creating that abundance and then scales out across the board. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening that we miss as a general population because it\u2019s not in our everyday lives yet. We miss how fast it\u2019s happening!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [41:30]: Yeah. So let\u2019s turn back to climate! I want to return to some of the future of energy and water desalination and the notion of, what if the US army couldn\u2019t afford like the price of oil?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [42:00]: Well, so oil is still a huge part \u2014 again, there\u2019s another example like AI, that people are looking at a binary number of, Okay, here\u2019s free energy, or when this happens and you\u2019re trying to\u2014oil is still a huge component of the whole energy infrastructure. And solar is a tiny component growing really fast and decreasing price every year as it grows. But today it\u2019s already one of the lowest cost energy forms! And it\u2019s getting cheaper every year! So if you play the trend on what that means, oil prices are gonna fall! Which is more deflationary. And as that happens, the more new energy coming on at lower cost, and more and more and more at lower cost, you can see that the number one driver of everything else, because energy is a construct in everything we do, everything that\u2019s used is built using energy. Entire war machine is really to protect energy, because if you have a lower cost energy, your economy was better. And that structural change is happening in our lifetimes! It\u2019s happening right now! And we can see it around us. And again, people are looking to the light switch moment. The light switch moment doesn\u2019t matter at all! It\u2019s just, if you look at the trend of what\u2019s happening, it\u2019s already right in front of us! It means prices should be coming down everywhere! Why are they not is because we\u2019re printing money to make them go up!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [43:48]: With the central bank digital currencies and the notion of fiat money getting digitized \u2014 which for me is digitized already, or is digital \u2014 but in terms of what they can do with the CBDC, I\u2019m almost framing that up as more of a war and battle between commercial banks and central banks. And that it\u2019s not so much about Bitcoin!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: I just put it out in my newsletter but it\u2019s gonna be released any minute. It explores this at a way deeper level, and mathematically what has to happen to the existing system, and how that benefits Bitcoin and what a new system will look like over time. But that next step \u2014 simply ask this, Why, for the longest time, JP Morgan and all the banks, everyone was totally against Bitcoin, and now why are they for it? Because they were the number one beneficiary of printing! Because they were at the top of the stack, and they could take all of their bad loans and bad assets, put them on the feds, and get new money, to be able to create and lend to society just on an accounting trick! And so that whole stack was at the top of the pyramid, and all of the banks were the biggest beneficiaries of central bank policies over the last 30 years! They couldn\u2019t lose! Because they couldn\u2019t fail! So it\u2019s a really good place, to have a one-way bet to win! And as those banks started to realize that the next step\u2014governments have to consolidate control and get into the distribution business\u2014the last part of the quasi-free market dies. And all of those banks realized \u2014 Oh my god! \u2014 I\u2019m not needed anymore as a transfer mechanism to get this money to society!

{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: I think it\u2019s too late! I honestly think that they can\u2019t! If enough got together \u2014 a lot of people listening to this won\u2019t have looked at all of this as deep as I have or maybe others have \u2014 they\u2019ll come out with the same tried and true, and they\u2019ll miss how fast this is moving! But today, how could you slow it? When I talk about The Great Reset and everything else, if you could have enough governments come together and create a new unit of value and agree on the rules that looked something like Bitcoin, that still gave them control \u2014 so that Great Reset idea, that Build Back Better idea \u2014 if enough governments got together to do that, you could slow Bitcoin. Because people might believe [that] and then slow the on-ramps to Bitcoin. I suspect in this environment \u2014 for those governments to come together to reset all of their imbalances and fiscal balances and everything else in this global trade thing \u2014 in this environment, that\u2019s an impossible task! It\u2019s an impossible task at the US level \u2014 Republicans and Democrats \u2014 let alone international governments and everything else. And why? For the same thing we talked about in game theory before: because everybody\u2019s after their own best interests! And so those types of events are typically only reset through war, not through people coming together. They\u2019re reset through war! So by the time governments try to figure out what that looks like, Bitcoin is gonna have broad adoption and it\u2019s gonna be a forcing function! But if you asked, What could happen? That is probably something that could slow it \u2014 not stop it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [49:06]: You mention in the book that Bitcoin is less concentrated today than the current economic system. And I wonder \u2014 outlandish thought\u2014if they could use money printing to race to concentrate Bitcoin to the money printers? Regardless of price. So now, price is just racing and it\u2019s meaningless to people who can\u2019t get enough fiat into the system. But the people who have the most fiat then can pay the bigger prices."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [49:38]: So, as they do that, their fiat will get destroyed in value.

But I\u2019m just asking on the other side of it: could we just be left with a similar situation where\u2014because maybe it\u2019s concentrated through a fair mechanism of using the money first to get to it.\u2014 we could maybe not get some of the benefits that we\u2019re hoping for?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: So again, in some of this, I just think that at the top level \u2014 at the very top level \u2014 technology today: technology, innovation, a free market, requires a currency that allows for deflation. It requires it! Because every other path concentrates wealth and power! Is that fair? Every other path concentrates wealth and power manipulation! So today where we are in technology, it\u2019s a requirement of any monetary policy that it allows for deflation. Otherwise you concentrate wealth and power. Now go to the next level: what is the most likely candidate to drive that change? The most likely candidate \u2014 [look at] already how fast Bitcoin\u2019s growing \u2014 is the candidate that is a forcing function from outside the system. It is a forcing function to that change! Will there be a whole bunch of stuff in the existing system that tries to protect it? Like Blockbuster adding candy aisles to their stores? Yes! Can it solve the problem? No! So I know what bet I\u2019m gonna make! I know when I see what\u2019s happening and where I\u2019m going to place bets as a result of this \u2014 and not just from a monetary gains standpoint \u2014 in fact, probably the way at least by the way I write the book, I care about the bigger tail risk of wars and what this looks like! Or a bigger tail risk than that \u2014 concentration of power by the state absolutely unequivocally.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [52:12]: Yeah and I got that! Your book is to me tremendously optimistic! I got that you\u2019re an optimistic person, but it laid out a lot of pessimistic facts and notions for me.

{"prompt": "Jeff Booth: And it\u2019s not to say I\u2019m not as well! You can tell by the House of Commons speech that I gave. And what I realize is, there\u2019s nothing they can do! There\u2019s nothing that the existing system can do, and the more they try to pile money into this the worse they make it for society. They\u2019re blowing up a balloon that is getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and the bigger the balloon, the bigger the pop on the other side. That\u2019s what I realized. And that\u2019s unfortunate! And I wish I could put my head in the sand and say, It\u2019s not true! But it is true! And nothing that all of the people inside the system that are blaming each other and pointing fingers about change that! I expect people to blame each other! I expect that to either scream into the vortex \u2014 one side versus the other\u2014not realizing that the thing that\u2019s in the middle of the whole thing that\u2019s creating all of the pain, and there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. I wish that wasn\u2019t true! What gives me an ability to write a book like that, and to \u2014 I\u2019ve done that all my life! That\u2019s what an entrepreneur does! They have a viewpoint for a better future, they work like hell. And if they\u2019re right and they can provide better value for society, and they get through the pain of what the old monopoly looks like and the market looks like \u2014 if they can get through all of that and they do this \u2014 then they win! And the only way they win is by providing value to society! So if you\u2019re that person, you almost have to hold two thoughts concurrently at the same time: (1) what the existing system looks like, and why it looks like this, and then (2) what it will do to try to protect itself as you move to a new system, as you try to accrue benefits to whoever can accrue benefits to the new system. But those two different things \u2014 because they\u2019re so different \u2014 are really hard for people to control in their minds! They go into the one system and essentially they\u2019re so scared of the transition or anything else that they can\u2019t actually look at logic! So they go back to, Well I need more money! The government should print more money and give it to me!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [55:13]: Right. You ask a few questions towards the end of the book that I ask myself every day. You framed them up really well though! And some of the reasons I\u2019ve maybe even challenged you on some of these notions is because, How many of our own beliefs stand up to the facts? To future generations, How many of our current actions fueled by those beliefs will look outright foolish? How do we overcome our errors, bias, and narratives that make up our operating system? And I ask these kinds of questions because I have so much conviction, and I believe you do too! And I still want to challenge our convictions! And that made me think a lot about how with just technology, how much information we deal with every day, how the world\u2019s information is doubling at an incredible rate! How do you decide or choose what information to consume, and maybe even in what form? Because time management is an issue! Time is scarce! You\u2019re not gonna know everything in the world, therefore maybe even we\u2019re wrong about some of the things we\u2019re [convinced] on \u2014 I\u2019m not getting at Bitcoin here \u2014 maybe on other things in our lives. But how do you deal with all that?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Booth [56:20]: I wrote the book in a way to try to teach other people to do some of the same things I do to do that. And by doing that, if you put yourself first with humility and say, I make these mistakes too \u2014 we all do. You can notice even on Twitter, a lot of times I don\u2019t say, You, You, You. I say, We, and, Me. I also make them. And then what do I do to avoid those mistakes? And you just hit on a really interesting thread that I think about: every abundance creates scarcity. So, (1) today we have an abundance of information and misinformation. And (2) on that, we are likely to click on things that we like or agree with and hang out with people that we like and agree with, because they reinforce \u2014 because it\u2019s easier. It reinforces our belief system! So I\u2019m bombarded with information, and we don\u2019t like to look at information that doesn\u2019t match our narrative. Me too! We all do! It\u2019s a natural fact! And so, how do I \u2014 if that\u2019s the truth, and I\u2019m just as likely as everybody else to do that \u2014 make sure that I spend my time, my most valuable asset, in things that don\u2019t get sucked into that vortex? And it\u2019s hard! You have to force yourself to look at other points of view with a really open mind! To be able to debate somebody else\u2019s point of view, like you know it better than them! And then come back to yours and look at something from all sides to realize that. And you can\u2019t do that on every single item, you just don\u2019t have the time to do it on every single item! So where are the things that are deeper? First principles that are \u2014 and money and power are pretty big! So what are the ones that are core to a whole bunch of other decisions that I might get wrong too? Go deeper on those ones, and then just keep asking why? Is it a belief or is it a fact? And that\u2019s really important today, because there\u2019s a whole bunch of people \u2014 you see it on Twitter all the time \u2014 that are shouting because of a belief! And a belief that is completely wrong, that doesn\u2019t have any facts! So is it a belief or a fact? And just keep on asking, Why do I believe that? Is that true? Is it for sure true? Or is it a belief? I understand because it\u2019s hard for anybody to do that, and the more information and the more information silos\u2014with both of those two things \u2014 make it even harder!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [59:32]: This has been so incredible Jeff!

{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: For sure! My name is Jake Chervinsky, I am General Counsel at Compound Labs, which is an open source development company in the crypto space. I do have one quick disclaimer which you\u2019ve probably heard from lawyers on podcasts before, which is: although I am a lawyer, I am not your lawyer, nor do I represent anyone in the audience, so nothing I say here is legal advice \u2014 just my thoughts on the issues we\u2019ll be discussing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: Of course. And so the hot topic is some of these new regulations. Can you give us an overview?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: To give you the big picture first, what we\u2019re seeing now is new developments in global anti-money laundering regulation, which is the set of rules that require financial institutions. So for our purposes: Bitcoin exchanges, custodians, and payment processors, to KYC or to collect due diligence information about their customers, like names, addresses, social security numbers, other information \u2014 to record that information and then also to report it to the governments, depending on what jurisdiction you\u2019re in. Here in the US, we focus most on the Bank Secrecy Act, which is the federal law that requires a variety of crypto companies including money transmitters to comply with those anti-money laundering obligations. [04:44] What\u2019s happening now \u2014 and I think the reason this was the right time for us to get together \u2014 is, the financial crimes enforcement network, or FinCEN, which is a bureau of the US Treasury department, has proposed a new rule that would expand the anti-money laundering obligations of those crypto companies beyond where they\u2019ve ever been before. Up until now the majority of the anti-money laundering obligations only applied to transactions of Bitcoin between crypto companies, as in, you\u2019re sending Bitcoin from one exchange to another exchange, or from one exchange to a custodian or some other regulated company. What FinCEN is proposing, essentially, is to expand those record-keeping and reporting obligations to transactions between institutions and wallets. Meaning, the company would have to do some KYC for transactions that a customer like you or me would try to either withdraw Bitcoin from the exchange to our own wallet, or deposit Bitcoin into the exchange from our wallet. So that\u2019s what\u2019s happening here right now in the US!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [06:03]: So there are a few terms mentioned inside this new proposed regulation. Perhaps you could spell out what they mean? So they say CVC and LTDA. What do those mean?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Yeah so those are peculiar terms to FinCEN. Basically every government agency comes up with its own acronyms to describe the types of things that we all talk about very differently in the industry. CVC stands for Convertible Virtual Currency. It\u2019s basically just FinCEN\u2019s word for any cryptocurrency or digital asset. Just as an example, the SEC \u2014 the Securities and Exchange Commission \u2014 uses the term digital asset to describe the same thing. So it\u2019s just a peculiar term for cryptocurrencies or digital assets in general. LTDA is actually a new one that I haven\u2019t seen before until just now! It stands for Legal Tender Digital Asset, which I think we would think of as a CBDC \u2014 a Central Bank Digital Currency \u2014 meaning, a cryptocurrency that is officially issued by a government, and represents not just a stablecoin that reflects the value of a fiat currency, but actually is recognized as an offical fiat currency.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [07:26]: Right. While we\u2019re on this whole terminology thing, I think many in the community would perhaps bristle at some of the terminology going around! Obviously we were joking on Twitter about self-hosted or unhosted wallets. Why is there this big difference in the way the terminology is being used? Is this essentially an attempt to reframe the conversation around privacy and sovereignty in our wallets?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [07:54]: Yes I think it is! As I mentioned, the government sort of adopts terms that fit their narrative. I think virtual currency is actually one of them! Something that\u2019s virtual sounds lesser than something that is real. And similarly, the government has adopted the terms hosted wallet and unhosted wallet to describe what we would think of as simply an account at a third-party custodian, or, your own wallet. And I think the reason that they\u2019ve done that in large part is, something that is hosted \u2014 a hosted wallet \u2014 sort of sounds safe! Right? It\u2019s hosted, there\u2019s someone in charge, it\u2019s all neat and tidy. Whereas something that is unhosted sounds dangerous. There\u2019s no one hosting it, who knows what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s kind of wild and out of control! And I do think that\u2019s the signal that some folks are trying to send by using the terms hosted and unhosted. [08:58] There\u2019s a third term that you mentioned which is self-hosted. I think that one has been a little bit confused among folks on Bitcoin Twitter. Self-hosted is not a term the government has been pushing. It was actually the industry\u2019s response to the term unhosted, in an attempt to say, These wallets are not some scary, wild, uncontrolled, unhosted thing. These wallets belong to real people who are exercising their rights of self-sovereignty in control of their own property, by \u201chosting\u201d their own wallets for themselves! And I think that wasn\u2019t received totally well because I think you and I would agree, we should really just call these accounts hosted at a third-party, or wallets, because a wallet is the default. But that\u2019s sort of the genesis of that term.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [09:52]: Well thanks for explaining that. For the listeners, maybe save the firepower against the unhosted wallet term then!"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Yeah I think that\u2019s right! Honestly the truth it, I don\u2019t think it matters what you call them! What matters is the principles underlying this issue and I think we should try not to get too distracted about semantics, and really focus on the issues.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [10:15]: Of course. So let\u2019s dive a little bit further into exactly what the burden\u2014or reporting obligation, rather \u2014 is on some of these Bitcoin exchanges or companies that are regulated. So can you tell us a little bit about the typical reporting obligations and how that would shift under the new proposed regulation?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Sure. Under current law, regulated institutions have to comply with something called the travel rule, which you probably hear about a lot. And what the travel rule basically says is, when a regulated institution sends Bitcoin or some other digital asset to another regulated exchange, along with the asset must travel information about the parties who are making the transaction. So if an institution is sending Bitcoin to some other institution, they have to include information about the customer who has sent that transaction. The travel rule essentially applies internationally. So it is a US law, but the same travel rule has essentially been implemented in every major jurisdiction with the exception of some places that you think of as offshore banking havens that the westernized world is trying to bring into compliance. But the travel rule has never applied to transactions outside the world of those regulated financial institutions! Anti-money laundering compliance obligations in general do not apply to individuals who are transacting on their own behalf. It only applies when there is a third-party intermediary that\u2019s transferring funds on behalf of customers or on behalf of other people. The proposal that FinCEN has put forward now is similar to what has come to be known as the Swiss rule. This is a sort of different implementation of the travel rule that Switzerland came out with earlier this year, which says that exchanges \u2014 or other regulated institutions \u2014 also have to collect information about transactions with wallets. Not just transactions with other institutions. The Swiss rule says that in order to process a transaction between institution and wallet, the institution must verify the beneficial owner of the wallet. Meaning, to figure out basically who owns the private key so you can figure out who is the person receiving these funds. And the proposal from FinCEN is very similar. It doesn\u2019t use the word verify, but what it says is: the regulated institution must obtain and retain the name and physical address of the counterparty of a transaction. Meaning, if you\u2019re, let\u2019s just say Kraken for example \u2014 you\u2019re a Kraken customer \u2014 and you want to withdraw Bitcoin to your own wallet, you would have to provide your name and physical address associated with the public key that you are withdrawing Bitcoin to. And similarly, if you wanted to withdraw Bitcoin from Kraken to someone else\u2019s wallet, you would have to give Kraken the name and physical address of that person even though they are not affiliated in any way with Kraken, or with whatever institution you\u2019re using! [13:54] So it\u2019s an expansion of anti-money laundering obligations in a way that will jeopardize the privacy of more people who are using Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [14:06]: I\u2019m also curious there because maybe a typical way that Bitcoin companies and exchanges will try to comply there is they will try to say to their customers, Hey! Now, we want to do withdrawals only to you and can you just certify this is only going to you and that you\u2019re not actually directly spending that out to, say, a merchant for example. Is that something we might see?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: It\u2019s certainly possible! The problem with these requirements is it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to prove who the owner is of a string of letters and numbers. Right? How do you prove the owner of a private key? And so what ends up happening is, these regulated institutions get very confused about how they can comply with these regulations. But they have to comply one way or another or they could be at risk of being penalized for violating the regulation. So one way to mitigate the risk of a violation is for an institution to say, Look, we\u2019re just not gonna allow withdrawals or deposits involving some other third party who isn\u2019t one of our customers, someone we don\u2019t have a business relationship with, someone who hasn\u2019t signed our Terms & Conditions, potentially waiving liability or other rights and litigation, so we\u2019re only going to allow these transactions with our customer. That would obviously be a significant limitation! I think that the biggest fear though, is that these institutions would say, Even for our customers, we fundamentally do not understand how we can verify the owner of a private key, because anyone else in the world could have the same string of letters and numbers and therefore have access to the Bitcoin associated with that private key! So we\u2019re just not gonna allow withdrawals and deposits at all! We\u2019re gonna essentially mandate custody and cut off transactions with people\u2019s wallets. That would be an extreme result, but I do think we need to be at least cautious about the possibility that that\u2019s where this is heading.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [16:16]: Right so it may be that that\u2019s not where it goes straight away, but it may be that there is a risk there that it would try to push us down this pathway, becoming a walled garden that nobody can leave. And then what would happen to the Bitcoin network at that point? All the Bitcoin that is sort of outside of that walled garden \u2014 it would just be a very weird situation! Probably an interesting example you might have seen is in the Netherlands, there was an example of an exchange called Bitonic, and they were asking for basically a wallet screenshot. Now, that doesn\u2019t necessarily verify that this person \u2014 well first of all, they could have just shown a screenshot from someone else\u2019s wallet! What\u2019s your take on that aspect? Could that be a way that some Bitcoin businesses try to comply with this rule, even if it\u2019s not technically bulletproof there?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [17:15]: It certainly could be! I think this gets back to theories of regulation. Let\u2019s assume for a second that we think that regulation is appropriate in the first place \u2014 which I think maybe you and some of the audience might not agree with! Let\u2019s just accept that premise for a minute! What you want in good regulation is clarity about how the target of the regulation can comply. Generally speaking, businesses are not that afraid of regulation as long as they know how to comply, as long as they\u2019re not worried that something\u2019s gonna go wrong, and they\u2019re gonna get tied up in some lengthy investigation or enforcement action that\u2019s going to result in significant penalties. So you want your regulators to be clear about how companies can comply! I think in this instance, it is very unclear, including in the case of the Netherlands, how a regulated institution can verify the owner of a private key, as you said \u2014 a screenshot could be from anywhere! Also, I could sign a message using a private key \u2014 that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m the only one that has that private key! So I think that there are a lot of open questions about how someone can comply with this rule. The hope is that regulators are providing some clarity to say, Look if you do it this way, if you take a screenshot, we\u2019re not gonna come after you! But again in terms of good regulation, that should be made clear to the public, not just to companies behind closed doors! And we\u2019re not seeing that kind of public process that we would expect in the case of good regulation that works well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [18:58]: So what is the impact then in terms of compliance burden and the potential chilling effect here?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: It really depends on how regulators interpret this! If they were to say, in FinCEN\u2019s example specifically, It is enough for the customer who is processing the withdrawal \u2014 receiving the deposit \u2014 to simply say the name and physical address of the counterparty to the transaction, and no further diligence is required. I suppose the compliance cost is fairly low, but the compliance cost is only one factor to consider. There are others. In terms of a chilling effect I think first of all this is a pretty significant infringement of privacy rights! I think that it\u2019s very different from regulations that have applied in traditional finance \u2014 the very specific targeting toward Bitcoin \u2014 in the sense that, when you withdraw paper cash from a bank, you do not need to prove anything about where the cash is going when you withdraw it. And similarly if you deposit cash at the bank, you do not need to prove where the cash is coming from. And to have this additional burden on the individual to hand over more information about the people that they\u2019re conducting financial transactions with is a significant infringement of their privacy rights \u2014 very different from what we\u2019ve seen before! [20:33] And you can imagine that customers who don\u2019t want to sacrifice their privacy rights would simply leave the jurisdiction! They would start patronizing companies in other jurisdictions! Bitcoin is a global phenomenon, and so I think that there\u2019s a chilling effect in that sense. I also think it may just discourage people from taking custody of their own assets. They may not want to deal with these compliance burdens and they may decide, You know what? I\u2019m just gonna leave these assets in custody because I don\u2019t want to deal with it! And I think all of that is really harmful to Bitcoin! And certainly not worth the alleged benefits that these regulations would provide [to the] government.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [21:16]: It\u2019s a really interesting point you mentioned there around how customers and go jurisdiction shopping, because I know even in the case of a regulation like FATCA, Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, and essentially this requires businesses around the world to go be a tattletale back to the US Government if there are any US customers. And so it pushes people in certain ways because now those non-US companies are often just saying, We don\u2019t want you if you\u2019re a US customer! Because we don\u2019t want to deal with that compliance burden! But in a small way like you were saying, maybe US customers will then go and be customers in some other Bitcoin business overseas so that they don\u2019t have to deal with as much of the compliance and that aspect of it!"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [22:06]: It\u2019s certainly possible! You make a great point. The more likely outcome is not so much that US citizens start using businesses abroad, but rather that US companies leave, and decide not to serve as US citizens. And as you point out, the US government tends to think that it has unlimited extra territorial jurisdiction, that its laws apply all over the world no matter where you are or who you are. And FATCA is the perfect example of how the US used its \u2014 basically the way that its ability to tax companies and to exclude them from the US economy \u2014 to force them to comply with US law even though they were outside the US. We see the same thing with someone like BitMEX, where BitMEX was not based in the US, and was at least making some attempt \u2014 although debatable how effective it was \u2014 to exclude US citizens from its platform, but because there were a couple of US citizens on the platform, the US governments view was, they\u2019re a strict liability for compliance with US law! If you service one US citizen, then you must comply with the full panoply of US laws! And so it is very hard to escape US jurisdiction and I do perceive this as another attempt by US government to reassert its authority globally over the operation of the financial system as a whole. US foreign policy is administered through the country\u2019s control of the financial system, and Bitcoin is essentially an existential threat to that control. Or at least it could be perceived that way \u2014 I\u2019m not sure it really is! But I think that\u2019s why we\u2019re seeing this rising concern over a peer-to-peer financial system that does not require the operation of intermediaries that the government can easily regulate.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [24:14]: From looking through the regulation, the proposed new regulation, I saw some discussion around what\u2019s called a foreign jurisdictions list. And I\u2019m also wondering, what is the potential impact for non-US customers of US Bitcoin businesses?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Right so this gets straight to the point that we were just discussing, which is: the US government wants to make sure that its rules are followed globally. But there are some jurisdictions where there are some companies that simply refuse to comply! Especially in sanctioned jurisdictions like Iran or North Korea or Venezuela or Myanmar \u2014 places like that. And the requirement of the foreign jurisdictions list basically says: We\u2019re also going to extend anti-money laundering compliance obligations for record-keeping and recording. Not just the transactions between institutions and wallets, but also between institutions that are compliant with the Bank Secrecy Act, and institutions in jurisdictions that do not comply with the Bank Secrecy Act. So when an exchange, for example, sends let\u2019s say $15,000 worth of Bitcoin to another regulated exchange that is compliant with the travel rule, the sending exchange does not need to report anything to the government, because the travel rule has been followed. What this new rule would say is: if the institution can\u2019t be sure that the other institution is compliant, then they do need to submit one of those reports to the government. So this is really another way for US government to get more control over institutions in those places that are refusing to play along with the rules that government is setting.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [26:04]: Stepping back, I guess listeners might be thinking, But hold on, wasn\u2019t there already an obligation for some of this reporting? So an example would be: suspicious matter reporting, or threshold reporting, where if the value goes above a certain amount, these transactions have to get reported to the government agencies like the IRS or to other law enforcement. Does this proposal mean that more data and more information is going to those government agencies, rather than the government agency having to colloquially \u201cget a warrant\u201d or to go through some legal process to ask for that information?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [26:45]: Yeah that\u2019s right. So there\u2019s a difference between an exchange being forced under a subpoena for example, to turn over information to government, versus the exchange having an affirmative obligation to automatically report that information to government. And I think that\u2019s one of the big differences here. Under current law, an exchange certainly already has all of this information about withdrawals to folks\u2019 wallets. But they aren\u2019t automatically turning that information over to the government in the form of a currency transaction report. And in fact, many of the exchanges will even publish information about what kinds of requests they\u2019re getting from government: how many subpoenas they\u2019re getting, how many of them they\u2019re challenging, how many of them they\u2019re actually having to comply with to turn over customer information. This new rule would greatly limit the ability of these exchanges and other companies to protect the privacy of their customers. And that\u2019s a really big concern, not only because in general we should respect consumer privacy and the privacy of people who are transacting in Bitcoin, but also because government just hasn\u2019t shown that they are either using that information effectively \u2014 and we could have a really interesting debate about whether the anti-money laundering system we have, which depends on financial surveillance, is even working, if it\u2019s even helping law enforcement to detect and prosecute crime \u2014 but also, government hasn\u2019t shown that they are able to safeguard that information. I mean just recently there was a report of a massive hack of the US treasury department specifically, in which an extraordinary amount of sensitive information was lost to hackers. And as we record this we still don\u2019t really have a good sense of what information was compromised and for how long! And I think that the idea that now is a good time to expand the government\u2019s warrant-less mass surveillance and data collection operations in light of everything that\u2019s been going on, is simply wrong!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [29:04]: It\u2019s a good example recently with the Ledger hack where initially there was a period where I think the number of e-mail addresses and information that got hacked or leaked was much less, and then later it was found out that actually it was much more had leaked. And so now if let\u2019s say in this example where a lot more information must be reported by the Bitcoin regulated company to FinCEN with all the reporting, then there\u2019s gonna be all this data out there of people\u2019s names, potentially their address, and which Bitcoin address they withdrew the Bitcoins to \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of potential information that could go to a very dark place if that information were to fall into the wrong hands!"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [29:54]: Right! And you know, two things on that: (1) this is really sensitive information! This isn\u2019t \u2014 we\u2019re not talking about something unimportant. We\u2019re talking about critical information not just where people live, right? The FinCEN proposal called for collecting the physical addresses of people who are withdrawing Bitcoin to their own wallets. It\u2019s very much like the Ledger hack. If you\u2019re loading up a hardware wallet with a lot of value in Bitcoin, you probably don\u2019t want people to know what your home address is! It\u2019s very sensitive information! (2) What government would say about this concern that these jackpots of sensitive information are being exposed by hackers \u2014 what they would say is: that\u2019s a cybersecurity problem. The problem is that companies are not doing a good enough job of protecting customer data. So we need to pass even more regulation, right? The GDPR for example \u2014 to require companies to do a better job of maintaining their customers\u2019 privacy. And I think the other side of that policy debate is the one that I would take and probably the one most Bitcoiners would take, which is: this data cannot be protected! There is no perfect cybersecurity system that is going to prevent these jackpots from being compromised! The solution is to simply not create the jackpots in the first place, and given that collecting all this information is yielding very little benefit to government in the first place, maybe we would be better served by simply not collecting it at all!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [31:36]: Absolutely. We\u2019ve got to think about also the broader context here as some lawyers in this space such as yourself and others have been commenting that this is like a midnight rulemaking. What is that?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: So midnight rulemaking is a term that describes the circumstance where a policy-maker is about to leave office. They\u2019ve maybe a month of time left, and they\u2019re trying to jam through some rule as fast as possible without following the regular order for considering whether the policy that they\u2019re trying to put into place is even good to begin with! Typically this occurs in the US in the transition period between presidencies. So we had a presidential election at the beginning of November. Donald Trump lost the election to Joe Biden. President-elect Biden will take office on January 20th. And at that point the treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin is out of a job. And really, this new regulation is something that Steve Mnuchin uniquely wants to pass! This is really not something that the entire treasury department is behind. It\u2019s really something that secretary Mnuchin believes personally is important. And it\u2019s something he wants to accomplish before he leaves office. So what he\u2019s done basically is to violate the regular order for considering a proposed rule like this. In the United States there\u2019s a federal law called the Administrative Procedures Act, the APA, which sets up the requirements for administrative rule making. And what it says basically is: an agency \u2014 before they can put a new rule into place \u2014 has to give the public notice of what the proposed rule is, and has to give the public an opportunity to comment on whether the rule is good or not! Whether it could be improved, whether it\u2019s flawed, what the cost-benefit is of the new rule. This is called notice and comment rule making. And for a significant rule \u2014 one that\u2019s gonna have a really big impact on industry or in society at large \u2014 an agency is supposed to give at least 60 days for the public to give comments. And then usually there\u2019s a long process after that where there\u2019s discussion and the back and forth between the industry and the agency, about whether the rule is good or not! And in this circumstance, because Secretary Mnuchin doesn\u2019t have 60 days \u2014 he has only 30 at the time we\u2019re recording this, before he\u2019s out of office\u2014he decided that for this rule there should only be 15 days for the public to comment! And not just 15 days, but 15 days at the end of December leading into early January over Christmas and New Year\u2019s when most people are trying to take a vacation! So the fear is that this is not a genuine process where Secretary Mnuchin is really soliciting input from the public that he will consider before deciding what he wants to do. But rather, that he already knows what he wants to do, and he\u2019s just sort of trying vaguely to go through the steps required to defend the rule from a legal challenge. But really this is a done deal and probably truly at midnight \u2014 the day before he is out of office \u2014 he\u2019ll decide to make this rule effective!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [35:18]: And to set the context as well\u2014as I have seen from the discussion \u2014 it seems that in other cases, for example in financial services or in the banking industry, there are some cases where the comment period is 6 years! Is that correct?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Yes that\u2019s right! Sometimes it\u2019s not the actual public comment period where the public can submit formal comments, but where the agency will then \u2014 after an initial 60 or 90 or 120-day comment period \u2014 will then schedule meetings. They\u2019ll hold round-tables with the industry, they\u2019ll do panels, they\u2019ll talk at conferences, they\u2019ll revise the proposed rule and they\u2019ll republish it and solicit new comments based on the revisions to the rule. And certainly there are circumstances where it does take years to craft good rules. And again, to the extent that we agree that it is appropriate to regulate something like Bitcoin, it is totally fair to believe that for something so novel and unique, something so different from what financial regulators have ever confronted before, there should be a really considered and nuanced, intelligent discussion, not a rush to put any new regulation that has very little benefit for government, at the cost of a huge burden to the industry and to individuals, just because one presidential candidate lost an election and doesn\u2019t have a whole lot of time left for his administration to put in the rules that they\u2019ve already decided are appropriate.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [38:44]: What can be done now to push back on this in terms of public comments and also from a more formal lobbying approach?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: I\u2019ll give you a few ideas. Some in the short term and some in the longer term. Right now we are confronted with this 30-day sprint where this rule may become effective before January 20th. And as the saying goes, laws are written in ink. They\u2019re very hard to erase! So what we really want to do is stop this rule from becoming effective before January 20th. Once there is new leadership in charge of the treasury department, we strongly believe that we will be able to convince leadership at FinCEN not to make this rule effective. And when I say we what I mean is the group of policy folks in Washington D.C. who work on these issues. So that means CoinCenter, which does phenomenal work, the Blockchain Association which is the group that I do most of my work through, the Chamber of Digital Commerce \u2014 all of these policy organizations are working very hard to stop this rule from going into effect. The way that folks can help us achieve that goal is first by submitting public comments. I\u2019ll be sure to provide more information about how to do that over the next couple weeks. We don\u2019t have a whole lot of time, but whatever we can do to convey the message that the process behind this rule and the substance of this rule are both unacceptable, the better chance we have of convincing Secretary Mnuchin that he should not take this last shot at Bitcoin on his way out the door. I also think that in terms of what we can do through the Blockchain Association and otherwise is, we can consider a legal challenge to this rule if it does go into effect. And that is something we are exploring now. We\u2019ve hired one of the best lawyers in the country, Paul Clement, who was the US Solicitor General under President George W. Bush, one of the most respected lawyers in the country, to help evaluate grounds to challenge this rule under the PA. And if it comes to it \u2014 I think that is likely what we will do \u2014 we will file a lawsuit and we will try to get a judge to stop enforcement of the rule hopefully long enough that we can have a change of administration and then FinCEN will have some cover to walk away from this rule. So that\u2019s all in the short term. I also just want to say, in the long term, I think we need to understand that this is just the beginning! Secretary Mnuchin is particularly hostile to Bitcoin, but that doesn\u2019t mean that once he\u2019s gone, everything is gonna be fantastic and great and wonderful! There are a lot of other policy makers in the US and globally for example within the Financial Action Task Force, the FATF, that believe in regulation like this! So what we really need to do long term is get a lot better at boiling down our arguments of why Bitcoin is so important. Why the benefits of allowing peer-to-peer transactions, of allowing self-sovereignty, why they outweigh the supposed costs to law enforcement. And furthermore why this phenomenon can\u2019t be stopped in the first place! All a country can really do is push this activity into other jurisdictions. They can\u2019t really stop it. So the better we are at making those arguments long term, the better we\u2019re gonna be at defeating this final boss that is trying to over-regulate Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [42:54]: And is this potentially just a first step towards further regulation and increased surveillance? What kinds of future steps could be taken if this is not pushed back on?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: I think the worst case scenario that I see right now is a bifurcated market very much like you described a little bit ago, where there is one market of clean custodial Bitcoin \u2014 Bitcoin that is held by regulated institutions that are not really self-sovereign in any sense, that no person really gets to control on their own, that the government can censor the same way that they censor the traditional financial system \u2014 and then a separate market of dirty Bitcoin. That is, Bitcoin that people actually hold themselves and are able to use and send in peer-to-peer transactions and custody themselves. And then no bridge between those two worlds. Every bank and every exchange would be prohibited from allowing deposits or withdrawals to people\u2019s wallets. I think that that is an alarmist view and I don\u2019t want to scare anyone too much, because there are a lot of people that will say that I\u2019m being paranoid and that\u2019s not really where we\u2019re going. But I fear, if you listen closely to policy makers, that what you hear from them is, they\u2019re okay with Bitcoin, as long as it looks likes digital gold in the same way as gold has been centralized in depositories that can be censored. As long as it doesn\u2019t pose a threat to monetary sovereignty, as long as it doesn\u2019t pose any other risks of terrorist financing or money laundering or other illicit activity. And that to me would be the worst case scenario, a total prohibition on transactions with non-custodial wallets. I\u2019m optimistic that we will not get there, I think that we have very strong arguments why that is a categorically worse world, and also why it is not an achievable world. But I do think that\u2019s sort of the final boss that we have to fight here.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [45:12]: As you mentioned earlier, FATF, Financial Action Task Force, seem to be very much a root cause driver of a lot of this kind of regulation around the world. Could you give us some background on what their influence is on all of this, and perhaps their influence on the domestic regulators around the world such as FinCEN?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Sure. So the FATF is an international standard setting body comprised of about 40 or so member jurisdictions. So you know the United States and Australia and Germany and all these other countries are members of and send representatives to the FATF. The FATF doesn\u2019t make any law, but what it does do is it makes recommendations for global industry standards. That it then sort of expects all of its members to adopt. And it does reviews on a regular basis of whether its various members have sufficiently complied with those rules. And the only teeth that the FATF has is they maintain a blacklist that basically says, If there\u2019s a jurisdiction that is really out of compliance, then no other jurisdiction should be allowed to transact with that jurisdiction. It\u2019s very much like US sanctions, and there\u2019s a lot of crossover between US sanctions and the FATF blacklist. The interesting thing is, the FATF bounces back and forth between setting its own standards that the member jurisdictions follow, versus following the lead of one or more of the member jurisdictions. Sort of like a pendulum in that sense. So sometimes the US, for example, will decide, Here\u2019s what we think the industry standard should be. And then they get the FATF to adopt whatever that is as its recommendation for the world. And sometimes vice versa, the FATF will actually generate some new recommendation that will bring member jurisdictions into compliance. Right now, what we\u2019re trying to figure out is, is the FATF going to recommend this Swiss rule or something like this new FinCEN proposed rule, that imposes AML obligations on transactions between institutions and wallets, or not! And so far they actually haven\u2019t. So Switzerland and the Netherlands which you mentioned, and the United States, are actually out ahead of what the FATF most recently recommended. So in June of this year the FATF did its 12-month review of its crypto guidance. And what it said basically was, We considered whether any restrictions on peer-to-peer transactions were necessary and thus far we decided there\u2019s insufficient evidence to warrant such new restrictions. But, some of our members expressed concern about this, and we will revisit this as we go forward. So one of the next big turning points that we\u2019re looking to in the coming year is the FATF\u2019s next 12-month review, which should be around June 2021. If they adopt this new Swiss rule or new FinCEN proposal as the global industry standard, then you could imagine seeing what is happened so far in only a couple of jurisdictions very quickly being rolled out to dozens of more jurisdictions and becoming the global standard. So I think we need to work very hard to convince policy makers at the FATF that that is not a good idea! But that\u2019s only something to watch.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [48:58]: Are there any domestic levers that people around the world can push on with domestic politicians to either push back on this or to change the way FATF is run?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Yes and no. Yes that there is a lot that people can do on the local level, and it\u2019s always important to point out that politics is local! And ultimately although many of our democratic are not functioning very well these days, our governments are at least supposed to answer to us the people. And to the extent that we can support and elect policy \u2014 elected officials specifically \u2014 who do not think that these requirements are necessary, and who will push back on them if other members of the government are trying to advance them, the better off we\u2019re gonna be! So here in the US as an example, there are members of Congress who fundamentally oppose this new proposal from FinCEN. In fact, four members of Congress sent a letter to FinCEN led by Warren Davidson, a member of the House of Representatives, advising Secretary Mnuchin that this was a bad idea! And the more of that kind of support we can generate just from a grassroots level by supporting politicians and officials who believe in the principles that we believe in \u2014 the principles that support Bitcoin \u2014 the more success that we\u2019re going to have. The reason I say also Yes but also No, is because in general the FATF is comprised of representatives who are not elected \u2014 they are appointed. And Secretary Mnuchin himself is not elected himself, he was appointed. So no one in the United States cast a single vote for this one individual who has more impact on financial regulatory policy than anybody else. And so it\u2019s very difficult to rein in the expansion of the administrative state. So it\u2019s really hard to get directly to the FATF, but much easier for us to focus on who are we voting for, and what do they believe? And will they make sure that the appointed officials \u2014 who are part of the administrative state \u2014 will they make sure that those folks are not doing things that compromise our privacy and our self-sovereignty?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [51:25]: Now, I\u2019m a libertarian and I understand not everybody is a libertarian, and I can certainly appreciate that there may be some more cypher-punk or libertarian minded people who think, Hey, there\u2019s no use trying to even get involved in the political process! Let\u2019s just have technology only and just totally disregard them! And yet there could also be a good counter-argument here that, Well, whatever your view on that is, maybe you are better off trying to push back that regulation to give the self-sovereign and more private Bitcoin more of a runway. What would you say to that kind of idea?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [52:03]: I think that it\u2019s a mistake to view it as an either-or. I think that there\u2019s room for us to do both! Look, I share a lot of the more cypher-punk values and libertarian values that you do \u2014 I\u2019m a huge fan of yours! I\u2019m listening with great interest to a lot of your discussion about libertarian ideals and Austrian economics. At the same time, I live in Washington D.C., I\u2019m very active in the policy community here, and I think there\u2019s room for both of us! To do our separate work. I think that you can\u2019t deny that government has influence over the rise of Bitcoin. And basically we can do this the easy way or the hard way. And I think we would all rather do this the easy way than the hard way! I totally appreciate that there is no way that the government could ban Bitcoin. At the same time I would rather not go back to a world where we have to meet up with people in back alleys in order to buy Bitcoin that we can actually custody for ourselves. And that requires us to be engaged in the policy process. It\u2019s not for everyone, and there are some people who just don\u2019t want to get involved in a place like Washington D.C. or any of the other political capitols of the world. That\u2019s fine! That\u2019s sort of how I view my purpose for being here \u2014 I will take that hit! And I will do the work of the swamp! Ideally what this leads to is more time for the industry as a whole to professionalize, to mature, to build more products and services that people can use to protect their own sovereignty and to protect their own privacy. So that if someday we do lose this battle from a policy perspective and government just decides, We cannot get our minds around Bitcoin, we\u2019re just not going to allow this to happen \u2014 at least we\u2019ve gone as far down the road as we can before we have that adverse result! At the same time I think that there is great opportunity for Bitcoin to rise in a cooperative way, in a symbiotic way, in a way that does not result in infringement of our rights, and I would at least like to hold out hope that we can make that happen!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [54:30]: What are the key points that Bitcoin proponents should be out here making, and who should they be making them to, such that the risk of overly draconian regulation is minimized? What sort of arguments should we be making?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [54:47]: Yeah. Honestly there\u2019s too many to list or even to keep track of! But I\u2019ll give you at least a couple of ideas and I think we can work on continuing to build this out as time goes on. One is about financial inclusion. I think that that\u2019s an idea that everyone can get behind. That most people in the world as a whole do not have access to reliable financial services. We\u2019re talking about people who live in places where the banks themselves are the criminal enterprise, and there is no way to conduct commerce because there is no way to transact with other people in a safe way at a distance. And I think that Bitcoin is the greatest force for financial inclusion that we can imagine! I think one person to listen to very carefully on that issue for example is Alex Gladstein at the Human Rights Foundation, because he does such a phenomenal job of highlighting cases where people are using Bitcoin not as a speculative investment \u2014 which is what I think a lot of policy makers in the developed world think that it is \u2014 but truly as a tool for commerce, and a tool to help them live better lives! I also think that there are arguments we can make about the ills of the financial system as it has come up around these very large, very powerful institutions that do not have our best interests at heart. And we\u2019re seeing this now with the rise of major tech companies that have started to dominate the Internet in the same way that the mega-banks have dominated finance. And really, what we don\u2019t want to see is \u2014 with all due respect to Facebook \u2014 we don\u2019t want to see the Facebooks of the world take over finance the way that they\u2019ve taken over the Internet. And Bitcoin is the response to that! It\u2019s public payments infrastructure, as opposed to a proprietary platform run by a company that is serving its own bottom-line at the expense of its customers instead of on behalf of its customers. Those are just two ideas that I think are particularly persuasive. But I think one of the beautiful things about Bitcoin is there is an argument that will persuade anyone if you could just figure out what principles matter to them and how Bitcoin addresses those principles! Maybe it\u2019s too much of a meme at this point, but Bitcoin fixes this! I know there is always some kind of argument that we can make to persuade folks to get onboard, and I\u2019m confident that the more we focus on sharpening those arguments, the more impactful they will be!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [57:36]: Of course! And I guess in this instance, although many of us are libertarian as we don\u2019t necessarily want big government, we want small or zero government, but in terms of meeting the other person where they are at \u2014 in some cases if you have to make an argument to somebody who is in that sort of position \u2014 perhaps an argument might be, Well, if you want your economy to be thriving, you\u2019ve got to care about jobs and businesses! And if you create this regulation and this legislation that is too burdensome, you will create a chilling effect where people may not start businesses or they may be hampered versus international competition in terms of being able to compete! So that perhaps that is an angle, an argument there as well in terms of, There\u2019s going to be an impact on jobs and businesses on your country!"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky [58:29]: I think it\u2019s a great argument! And right, it might not strike everyone as the best idea \u2014 depending on your view of government in the first place \u2014 but just as an example, Pierre Rochard put out a really interesting idea recently, which is that the US government should stop selling Bitcoin! It should start building a Bitcoin reserve! And look, that\u2019s a pretty compelling argument! And whether you want the US government to own a lot of Bitcoin or not is sort of besides the point! If you can get government to buy into the asset, then Bitcoin will sort of take care of itself on the other end, right? Bitcoin is in many ways unstoppable! So the more adoption there is, and the more approval there is, I think the more likely it is that we will end up seeing the kind of world that we think Bitcoin will usher in. There are other arguments that we have to think really hard about whether we want to make or not. One of the arguments is, really for the defense community. Which is, Bitcoin is a very effective tool of geopolitical monetary war. If you want to undermine an authoritarian or dictatorial opponent, well sanctions are fine \u2014 it\u2019s what we\u2019ve tried to do \u2014 but really they\u2019re not fine. I\u2019m just articulating the way you might describe this to a policy maker! Better than using sanctions and cutting a country off from the financial system, is to undermine their own currency, and the more you can promote use of Bitcoin in that society, the less powerful the dictator or authoritarian will be! Now whether we want our governments using Bitcoin as a weapon of geopolitical war we should think very carefully about. But this is just to the point that there is always an argument about how Bitcoin can be used as a tool to accomplish an objective! And I think it behooves us to figure out what those arguments are to promote the likelihood that Bitcoin will rise peacefully, at least to the extent that it can.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:00:44]: Yeah that\u2019s a really good one and it reminds me of how the US government actually funded Tor as a way to essentially have its own operatives be able to operate in places more privately and I think it\u2019s a similar kind of thing where you could see it cutting both ways, but perhaps there\u2019s a net benefit to support it!"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: It\u2019s very similar and once we are able to dig a couple levels into the nuance here, what you realize is all technology neutral, all of it can be used for good or ill, and just because a technology is used by some bad actors doesn\u2019t mean that you outlaw it! What it means is you use it for as much good as you can, and you try to limit \u2014 perhaps \u2014 its use by bad actors to the extent that you can. But this is the story of every technology throughout human history! The first use of an automobile was for a bank robber to get away from the police faster, right? Like this is always what happens! The bad guys use technology first \u2014 it doesn\u2019t mean we throw it away! And I do think that if you can get to that level of nuance and admit that, Yes, just like the Internet, Bitcoin is open for use by anyone. But the benefits of Bitcoin, the good that it does for the world, so far outweighs the harms that it may enable by some bad actors \u2014 because of that, we should support Bitcoin\u2019s growth and adoption, not try to hinder it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:02:17]: Right. Maybe then if I were to play-act as a policy maker, they might say, Well fine! You can hold your Bitcoin! But just hold it in this custodial account! And I think in their mind, they don\u2019t see the value so much as perhaps you and I do and the other Bitcoin people do, of a strict supply limit and the ability to use it in a self-sovereign way, and I guess that\u2019s really the argument we have to make!"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Yeah I think that\u2019s absolutely right. And that\u2019s why I give those two examples as maybe the best arguments for Bitcoin as a tool of self-sovereignty, not just as digital gold that you can hold in a depository. That is, the ability to use it in jurisdictions where there is no financial infrastructure that is reliable using intermediaries \u2014 and that is the majority of the world! There is no reliable bank in most places where people can just hold it in custody! And the risks that centralizing all of this \u2014 not just information but value \u2014 in institutions that can be hacked, that cannot safeguard those assets. Think of Mt. Gox as an example! Every couple months we see a big exchange hack! Those are reasons why Bitcoin is much much better as a tool of self-sovereignty, as something people can hold and safeguard on their own and use on their own without relying on intermediaries, than it is as just something you can throw a few dollars in, the same way you might buy the S&P500 Index.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:03:53]: Jake I\u2019m gonna try to get this excerpt out in the next day or two, but in terms of how people can support you or if they can do a comment, have you got any suggestions for them in terms of how they can help?"}
{"prompt": "Jake Chervinsky: Yes! So as of now, so we\u2019re recording at about 6:30PM on Monday, December 21st. The rule actually has not been published yet in the federal register, so the public comment period isn\u2019t open yet. We think that it\u2019ll be published on Wednesday, the 23rd. Once it\u2019s published, I\u2019ll make sure to put out on Twitter some advice about how to write a good public comment, just sort of a how-to of where do you go, how can you write something that\u2019s effective, write simple things like, don\u2019t just curse at the regulators and call them statists! Because that\u2019s probably not gonna help very much! So I would say, follow me on Twitter if you don\u2019t and hopefully we can all work together to share the good arguments that we can advance and we can all get as many public comments submitted as possible before the period closes. And then we\u2019ll see what we can do from there!

Well thank you very much for really shining a light on this issue for us! I think there\u2019s a lot of complicated issues that you\u2019ve really helped untangle for me and for my listeners.

{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux [00:55]: Thanks for having me man! I really appreciate it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah! Let\u2019s get into the first thing, I\u2019m just kinda curious: what is the maintainer of the BTCPay-Python library do and what does that even mean? I hear Python and I think snakes. I know it\u2019s coding and you\u2019re uploading the programs but that\u2019s all I know."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Yeah it\u2019s a very small library that interacts with the BTCPay API. So the short story is if you are trying to build, say, an e-commerce site or something like that and you\u2019re building it in Python and you want to accept BTCPay for payments, you can make use of this library as sort of a layer that can help you communicate with your BTCPay server and automatic everything through the shopping cart and all that sort of stuff. And it would also help you track your payments, things like that. That part of BTCPay is a huge project! The Python library is just a little tiny, teeny piece of it. Not a ton of code involved in it. It just helps you, like I said, interact with BTCPay server if you\u2019ve got a Python-based application that you\u2019re running. Python\u2019s a programming language.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Sure! What drives you or motivates you to take on this project or spearhead it? Put your time and energy into it?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: I just kind of did it for the hell of it! So I didn\u2019t design the library, I picked up maintaining it and added a few things to it, because it didn\u2019t have a current maintainer at the time. So I went to school a very long time ago for computer science, actually before Python was even a language that was really in use. So I had some level of background in it from undergrad, but I never had a job as a software engineer or anything like that. I didn\u2019t end up even finishing the computer science program at school. But, when I got more into Bitcoin one of the first things I did a couple years ago is I took Justin Moon\u2019s bootcamp that he was giving at that time which was taught in Python. It was a Bitcoin-related Python coding bootcamp called BUIDL Bootcamp. I took it and one of the the things I started playing around with once I got back into coding was BTCPay \u2014 which is not a Python-based project in general\u2014it\u2019s written in C#. But I actually just looked to see if there was any way that I could help or contribute, and one of the things I did was I ended up taking over maintaining that library, because I built a Python-based plug-in for it that helped it communicate with QuickBooks. So I was making use of the Python library, and then at that point Nicholas asked me if I\u2019d be interested in taking over the maintaining the Python library. So I did! It\u2019s a small project, doesn\u2019t require a big brain to do it, which made it perfect for me! So that\u2019s how I got involved in it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [04:07]: I think you\u2019ve got a big brain! You\u2019ve got some big brained ideas! And we\u2019re gonna get into them momentarily. The next thing I want to talk about \u2014 so you said you went to school for computer science in undergrad. Somewhere you picked up your JD and your CPA. So I\u2019m assuming you went to law school and just picked up your CPA after that?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: No not quite! So I went to night school. I worked full-time undergrad and law school. So I didn\u2019t really take school all that seriously, particularly undergrad. I was just working. Back in those days you could still make a pretty good living without a college degree, so I did I worked as a salesman. I did the computer science thing \u2014 I excelled at it, but I was like, Well, I can keep doing this computer science major while I\u2019m working, and it actually requires a decent amount of work, and there\u2019s no girls in computer science classes. Or, like I speak Spanish pretty well, so I could just major in Spanish instead, and those classes are essentially all female, and the classes aren\u2019t that difficult! So I was like, Oh! This is like a no-brainer decision! I\u2019ll just finish my degree in Spanish, so I did! That\u2019s why I got my undergraduate degree in Spanish. Then when I graduated I was like, Well, at this point I knew I didn\u2019t want to be a salesman forever, but I didn\u2019t really know what else I wanted to do. I don\u2019t know if any of you guys have done commissioned sales before, but it really grinds on you after a while! You\u2019re dealing with the public all day in kind of a high pressure situation. You\u2019re spending your entire day all day making people buy stuff. Persuading people to buy stuff. I didn\u2019t want to do that, so I just started looking for a profession where I thought I\u2019d be pretty well set. Something that required licensure so that I didn\u2019t earn a decent living that anybody could just get involved in it. And I bounced around a few different ideas. I was always kind of technical minded, so I thought maybe getting involved on the tax side might work out for me in that way, and in my little town there just happened to be a guy that happened to be both an attorney and a CPA, and I realized that that made you more unique in the marketplace, it allowed you to do more interesting stuff if you had both as opposed to just being a CPA or something like that. So I went to law school, which I also did at night. Now keep in mind at this point I\u2019d never taken an accounting class before \u2014 I had still never taken an accounting class in college. I had a bachelor\u2019s degree in Spanish and that was about it! So what I did was I went to \u2014 well the first thing I did was I taught myself accounting from a CPA exam prep book, and then I took the CPA exam and passed it. So at that point you still can\u2019t be a CPA though, because to be a CPA at least at that time in my state, you had to have a bachelor\u2019s degree, you had to have at least 150 credits, which I didn\u2019t have because you need 120 for a bachelor\u2019s degree which I didn\u2019t have yet. At least 30 of your credits had to be in accounting, and you had to work under the supervision of a CPA for at least a year like a full-time job. So what I did was \u2014 CPA exam into obtaining a full-time job at a small accounting firm where I didn\u2019t get paid very much but they were great to take me on and teach me. I don\u2019t think they even realized that my degree wasn\u2019t in accounting, because on my resume I just put that I had a bachelor\u2019s degree and I passed the CPA exam \u2014 and passing the CPA exam is kind of all that matters. So I got that job and I worked there while I went to law school at night. They were flexible and allowed me to not have to work crazy hours or anything like that so I could commute to law school at night. So I did that for a year and I had the experience requirement and now I had the 150 credits because my law school credits counted, they were still credits. But I didn\u2019t have the 30 credits in accounting. In New Jersey we have a university called Thomas Edison state college that will give you credit for your life experience, so I went to Thomas Edison state college and said, Hey, I had passed all four parts of this CPA exam on my first try, and I\u2019ve been working in public accounting for a year \u2014 will you guys give me 30 accounting credits based on that experience? And they said yes! Predominantly based on the strength of having passed the CPA exam. So I had to pay for those credits, of course, but I didn\u2019t have to actually take classes or tests for them. I had to provide proof of everything, proof that I passed the CPA exam, proof that I\u2019d been working in public accounting for a year, and they gave me 30 credits for accounting on a pass/fail basis, but they were still college credits. And they weren\u2019t from the institution where I had my bachelor\u2019s degree but that didn\u2019t matter. At that point I had all of the requirements I needed to pass my state\u2019s licensing requirements, so I did! Around that same time, I also finished law school and took the bar exam and passed that. Bar exam much, much easier than the CPA exam \u2014 not even close! CPA exam, much much much harder! At least in my state. Yeah CPA is really four different exams. You take it in four parts, it has some much bigger breadth of knowledge. Bar exam is two days. You just sit down, two days, you\u2019re down with it. At that point, I was licensed in both! I knew that I wanted to do my own thing, so I opened up my own firm right away as soon as both of my licensures were finalized. In the beginning, Bitcoin didn\u2019t exist back then, so I didn\u2019t have any focus obviously at all with regard to Bitcoin. I just had a tax firm. I did tax returns, I did tax planning work, I did a lot of estate planning work back then too. In those days the estate tax threshold was only a million dollars, so a lot of people were paying federal state tax so they needed fancier estate plans because they needed to be really tax-driven. That\u2019s not really the case anymore, estate planning is not really as tax-driven because for a married couple today, the federal state tax threshold is almost $23 million dollars. So the type of work that I used to do pretty much disappeared over the years! It just wasn\u2019t a thing that people needed anymore, for regulatory reasons. Around that same time I started to get involved with Bitcoin! Bought Bitcoin myself and I was like, Well, wouldn\u2019t it be really cool if I could buy Bitcoin for myself in a tax-advantaged way through a retirement account. So I came up with the structure \u2014 now I refer to it as The KeyKeeper IRA structure \u2014 then, it didn\u2019t even have a name. For myself, predominantly! I was like, well this is for me! And I offered it to clients as a thing around that time but nobody cared. Most people had never heard of Bitcoin, the people that had heard of Bitcoin were like, if you talked to them about taxes they thought you were a Fed. Funny story about that, I wrote an article for CoinDesk a million years ago back when it was \u2014 CoinDesk didn\u2019t even have professional journalists back then, they would accept open submissions. And it was about tax consequences of Bitcoin. Real, real basic stuff. This was back when you could just have open comments under articles. All the comments were like, Don\u2019t listen to this guy! He\u2019s a Fed! He\u2019s out to get us! That was the environment back then. So nobody really cared for several years. For the first couple of years I probably did none of these for clients. And then I was doing one or two a year. Stuff like that, for just various oddballs. Then 2017 happened, right? With the bull rally in 2017 all of a sudden there was interest in this! Bitcoin, of course, and then a lot of it was shitcoiners too, because the structure \u2014 I mean I market it for Bitcoin because that\u2019s all I care about but it works for all those shitcoins as well. There was a lot of interest in it and it started to become a bigger and bigger part of my practice! Even when the rally ended in 2017 it didn\u2019t just die off as an a practice area for me. It just has grown over time to now it\u2019s like three-quarters of what I do!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [13:35]: Yeah! You\u2019re very multi-faceted! And so the first thing I do want to get into is the KeyKeeper IRA. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve connected the dots but I\u2019m a client. I think it\u2019s fabulous! I think it\u2019s actually taken a very different turn in 2020 with the COVID Care Act. So maybe can you elaborate on what is KeyKeeper IRA? How can people use it? I think this is a fabulous tool right now that not enough people have awareness of!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Right! Even GBTC, exactly!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: They want exposure to Bitcoin in their 401(k)! Or anything else!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: In their retirement accounts, right? So the idea behind it is, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to be able to use those tax-advantaged funds to hold Bitcoin and to hold the Bitcoin directly such that you could hold your own keys? And that\u2019s advantageous for two reasons: (1) if you\u2019re doing it in a way that you\u2019re holding your own keys, you\u2019re sticking with the ethos of Not your keys, not your Bitcoin, and (2) if you buy GBTC, first of all, you have to be an accredited investor, and even if you are an accredited investor and you\u2019re able to buy GBTC to a regular brokerage IRA, the fees are colossal. There\u2019s like a 2% annual assets under management fee that goes to the fund manager. It\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s huge. So you\u2019d rather not have that giant fee eating up your returns! So the largest obstacle to being able to have this Bitcoin and hold your own keys within the auspices of a retirement account is that, under federal law, to qualify as an IRA, there has to be a third party custodian. And that third party custodian has to basically be a bank, a trust company, or this other category called a licensed non-bank custodian that gets special IRS approval. So how do we get around that? To get around that I adapted a structure that had been used for several years before this for real estate investing through an IRA. Basically the way we get around it is: we set up this custodial account for you with an appropriate financial institution, but the only asset actually owned by your IRA is either a limited liability company or a trust. The structure works both ways regardless of whether you use an LLC or a trust as that entity, but it\u2019s a state-to-state issue. Some states impose ridiculous requirements on LLCs like California does, so we use a trust in those states instead. The idea is the same. So this entity is the only asset owned by your IRA. You don\u2019t own the entity, it\u2019s owned by your IRA. However, you are the manager of the entity, in the case of an LLC, or the trustee of the entity in the case of a trust, which gives you the sole control over its assets. So any money that flows into your IRA is then immediately invested into this entity, and once it\u2019s in the entity you have control over it. So that requires \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of regulatory stuff about what has to be in the entity\u2019s operating agreement, etc. to make that work, but we handle that all for you, and then we help you get an account open on an exchange under the name and tax ID of the entity. It\u2019s very important \u2014 it can\u2019t be under your own name or social security number. You can use that account to then go ahead and buy your Bitcoin and you don\u2019t have to store it on the exchange, you can transfer it off the exchange and custody it yourself as the manager of that LLC or as trustee of that trust. You have to keep it very segregated, you can\u2019t mix it with your other non-tax advantaged Bitcoin. And that\u2019s basically, in a nutshell, how the structure works. That\u2019s how it works for most people who are not self-employed. If you\u2019re a self-employed person and you own your own business, if you don\u2019t have any full-time employees, we can actually have it such that your company 401(k), believe it or not, can hold Bitcoin, and you can hold your own keys yourself. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t quite work that way if you\u2019re self-employed and you have full-time employees. Then, the 401(k) structure isn\u2019t available to you. You\u2019re stuck with the IRA structure. But that\u2019s what I more or less spend all my time doing all day.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [18:34]: Awesome! I think it\u2019s a great service for Bitcoiners, and I think it\u2019s a great service for anybody! I\u2019m a client and I\u2019m not gonna diss any other companies, but I will say that I did my own research \u2014 everyone should do their own \u2014 and I found that Jeff\u2019s KeyKeeper IRA was the best service available on cost and service. And he walks you through the whole process."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: I appreciate that! To touch on that for a brief second: our cost structure is a lot different from anybody else who does this. Most of the other players that allow Bitcoin IRA exposure, they don\u2019t charge an upfront fee like I do, but they also charge recurring fees that are significantly higher, oftentimes they\u2019re expressed as a percentage of the value of the Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yes. Think about how that scales."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Exactly! Right. With our structure, you pay me once to set up the legal structure, and that\u2019s it! You don\u2019t pay me again. At that point you can buy and sell Bitcoin as much as you want. This entity has its own exchange account that has nothing to do with me! It\u2019s on a regular, normal exchange so that you can buy and sell as much as you want. You\u2019re good to go! You\u2019re fully compliant with the IRS.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [19:54]: I\u2019ll add that I even transferred some 401(k) money into ROTH to incur taxes now so I\u2019ll never incur taxes again on my self-managed owned Bitcoin within my retirement plan again. I think that\u2019s a really powerful tool. Your service helps more people achieve sovereignty and independence. And get ownership over their own stuff!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Yeah! I appreciate that! And that\u2019s a good point you made there about the ROTH thing. I mean you can do this as a traditional IRA or a ROTH IRA, however probably 70\u201380% of the ones that I do are ROTH.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Right now in this current environment, taxes are low, if you can incur taxes now \u2014 this is not financial advice , do your own research, this is a philosophy show\u2014but you know, this could really help you manage your tax affairs and gain sovereignty. And Jeff will walk you through it! I want to get into a couple other topics, because you just bring a lot to the table. Before we get into what I think is really juicy, I just want to touch on bodybuilding. You\u2019re a bodybuilder, and you\u2019re very public about it \u2014 that\u2019s why I\u2019m bringing it up \u2014 it\u2019s on your profile. I wonder how much of that is because of low time preference for you? And it kind of forces you to regulate or stay in a low time preference mentality? And I\u2019ve heard you speak on it on shows that you compete on it every other year, and there\u2019s a lot of dietary aspects to that to I just wanted to touch on that a bit. And final note: I\u2019ve never been a weight-lifter or anything, but I\u2019m recognizing that I\u2019ve gotta start. My back is fucked up, and I need to take care of it!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux [21:52]: The dietary stuff is the big difference between being a competitive bodybuilder, and the guy who lifts and looks good at the beach but doesn\u2019t compete. The dietary stuff is the difference. I\u2019ll give you an example: when you\u2019re dieting down to get on stage for a show \u2014 and you\u2019ll see how this ties into what I\u2019m talking about with self-discipline \u2014 you\u2019re not dieting down to a healthy level of body fat, you\u2019re dieting down to a level of body fat that is absolutely not sustainable! It\u2019s not gonna hurt you to maintain that level of body fat in the short term, but that\u2019s why I generally compete like every other year. When I say every other year I might do a few shows that year, try to keep them close to each other time-wise.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [22:41]: Right so you can get in that box where you\u2019re in this unhealthy, non-sustainable mode."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Right, and you feel horrible! You feel horrible, you have no energy \u2014 the other point I should make is I compete in drug-tested natural bodybuilding too, it\u2019s a little bit different. Not saying there isn\u2019t a lot of self-discipline with enhanced bodybuilding\u2014enhanced is what we call non-drug tested bodybuilding \u2014 there is! It\u2019s a different type of bodybuilding. It\u2019s a different sport. But yeah, you feel terrible, and you\u2019re just not nearly as strong. You lose significant strength in getting ready for a show. I\u2019ll give you an idea: I am 190 pounds sitting here right now, and I have a six pack \u2014 it\u2019s not the most razor sharp six pack but if I took my shirt off you\u2019d definitely see all six of my abs and I would look great at the beach, right? That\u2019s at 190 pounds, I\u2019m 5'11\". If I was gonna compete, I\u2019d probably be competing at about 170, maybe the low 170s, and I would have to start losing close to 20 pounds to get on stage right now. That would take me probably about 4\u20135 months to get ready, because you can\u2019t lose that too quick \u2014 you\u2019ll lose all your muscle. So think about what an unhealthily lean level that is. Like, if I\u2019m already \u2014 what by normal stands would already be considered lean \u2014 and I\u2019d have to drop another almost 20 pounds to get on stage. It\u2019s brutal! Which is why it\u2019s mostly a self-discipline sport. Well it\u2019s genetic ability, right? A lot of stuff that I can\u2019t control. I have very, very long limbs, that\u2019s horrible for bodybuilding, because my biceps and my quads just never look as impressive because they\u2019re stretched over a longer distance. I have extremely long limbs considering I\u2019m only 5'11\" \u2014 I\u2019m not 6'8\" or something like that. But if you wanna get out there and put out your best package on stage it\u2019s a self-discipline issue, it\u2019s being able to lose all that weight and spend 4\u20135 months in a diet losing weight. When I say in a diet, I\u2019m dieting I\u2019m not eating junk, I\u2019m monitoring what I\u2019m eating all year round. It\u2019s just the sheer volume of what you\u2019re eating gets so low. I mean by the time I got on stage this most recent time, I was almost down to a thousand calories a day. And you\u2019re not doing that low of a caloric intake the whole time, you\u2019re ratcheting it down slowly over time, but it\u2019s very difficult. And the reason why \u2014 to get to your point \u2014 it\u2019s all just self-discipline. And I guess that probably on some level is a function of time-preference: being able to delay that gratification or have that level of self-discipline, to put that level of work in.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [25:41]: Which is more rewarding to you? Affecting the self-discipline over time or competing? I guess they go hand-in-hand because the discipline leads to what you\u2019re gonna get in the competition, but I\u2019m asking like, Do you care about the competition, or is it the journey of the discipline to get to the competition?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Oh no, I care about the competition! I\u2019m not even \u2014 I\u2019ve never won a show. The highest I\u2019ve even finished in a show is second, so I\u2019m not \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: You did get a special award for a certain class, I think!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux [27:26]: I\u2019ll do a CYA thing here real quick: I\u2019d advise everyone listening not to break any laws and to always check with your doctor, okay? That said, I don\u2019t really have a problem with enhanced bodybuilding at all, and steroids in general, too. To be honest, based on the research and the data that we have, if you do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way, you\u2019re gonna look awesome! If you work as hard as me and you do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way and we have equal genetics, let\u2019s say, you\u2019re gonna look 1,000x better than me! And you\u2019re probably gonna be fine! It\u2019s probably not gonna affect your longevity or your overall health. The issue is, and I don\u2019t have a problem with these guys doing it, you can\u2019t do a moderate amount of steroids in a smart way and compete in enhanced bodybuilding. It\u2019s just not how it works! You have to take the drugs to a much more extreme level that probably is gonna have damage to your health. There\u2019s ways to mitigate that. There are guys out there that competed in bodybuilding and do live long lives, because even under the auspices of being more extreme, they still did it the smartest way they could, and they also were probably better genetically suited with the drugs \u2014 that\u2019s another part that no one talks about. But for me, I never went enhanced because \u2014 I wanted to be able to compete, and I didn\u2019t want to have to do the drugs in such an extreme way. And if you don\u2019t do it in an extreme way and you try and compete, you\u2019re just gonna look terrible compared to guys that do! You\u2019re just not gonna be able to compete. So for me, natural was a no-brainer for that reason. But I definitely don\u2019t have a problem with people \u2014 if you just are like recreationally lifting and you don\u2019t want to compete, and you want to do steroids, I would say, Just be smart about it, get your blood work done, do it in consultation with a doctor. I don\u2019t really see anything wrong with that at all! The only time it would really bother me, is if you\u2019re doing steroids and you\u2019re trying to sneak into one of our shows and compete with us! You have your own shows for that! Let us have our thing, let us compete \u2014 that\u2019s our thing. But other than that, I certainly don\u2019t have \u2014 I have unnamed friends that do steroids. I\u2019d never try to talk them out of it or anything.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [29:58]: Before we get into the real juicy stuff with the post-capitalism future, how did you come to Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: From gold! Like most gold guys.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: So: a post-capitalist future. I really wanted to dig into a lot of these ideas. I find myself just being riveted by your posts. I don\u2019t have a lot of commentary in terms of agreement or disagreement \u2014 I\u2019m just nodding my head! So I guess it\u2019s agreement! I\u2019m just enthralled with this discussion that you\u2019re bringing into the table. Just to kick off, though, you mention that each generation improves its lot as compared to the one before, but an economic system can only last as long as that\u2019s happening. So how to you frame up \u2014 you talk a lot about the 20th century and what happened there, but you use a lot of terminology like neo-liberal, globalist-capitalist, social democracy, market socialism, socialism. So if you could level-set a bit, so that we can get into some of these topics and what these words mean to you before we go further? Because it\u2019s really important to the conversation, and I think you have a really good handle on what these terms mean, at least how you\u2019re gonna conversate about them. And framing them up, because I think they get tossed around \u2014 no pun intended \u2014 liberally."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux [31:45]: Yeah they do! And part of the issue is different people can define them differently. So for instance to a Marxist, the type of economic system that I talk about, they would still consider that capitalist. But a distributist wouldn\u2019t. So I\u2019ll just talk about the way that I define these terms, so that we could at least be consistent. Sometimes maybe I\u2019ll even draw some distinctions on how other people may define them. Capitalism to me is basically a market-based economy, more or less. And a market-based economy where competition is held to the inherently good, and where you do not want to interfere with the market itself. Like what Mises would call a hampered market. I\u2019m not including that within the definition of capitalism for purposes of what I\u2019m talking about. So, we\u2019re in right now what I would still consider a capitalist society and Libertarians would balk at that because they\u2019ll say, Oh! Well there\u2019s all these government regulations, there\u2019s all these things that affect the market! But the reason I still consider that capitalistic is because there are usually regulatory structures and other structures that are just prop up the market system itself from collapsing. They\u2019re in fact not designed to hampered the market, they\u2019re designed to keep it going at least for the benefit of the people that have the largest amount of market power, okay? That\u2019s how I would define a capitalist system. A socialist system to me is one that\u2019s based on socialized production. Meaning that you don\u2019t have private ownership of the means of production in the ways that we\u2019re used to. The workers aren\u2019t in control of the means of production and that could be through \u2014 there are a zillion different flavors of socialism, right \u2014 you could have libertarian socialists where there\u2019s not a state that\u2019s really mediating that versus a Marxist-Leninist where there is a very centralized state that\u2019s mediating that. I won\u2019t get into all those distinctions right now. But those were the two competing schools of thought more or less throughout the 20th century and even into the 21st. The 20th century specifically was defined by the conflict between capitalist and socialist production. There were other economic systems that were posited during that period that never really got too much traction. Social democracy to me \u2014 which really did take off in the latter half of the 20th century \u2014 was more or less an attempt to prop up the capitalist system through transfers. The workers don\u2019t really have power in most social democratic systems that we see today. They\u2019re just thrown tax transfer payments and stuff like that just to keep the system going, to prevent them from starving, creating trouble, revolting, things of that nature. And if you take that out far enough, social democracy and things like that, what will start happening is \u2014 and this is what I think we\u2019re seeing right now \u2014 we\u2019re seeing a system where over time what happens is capital always seems to centralize. That seems to be the natural thing \u2014 if you have a market, eventually someone\u2019s gonna win in that market. And when they win and they put their competitors out of business, their accumulation of capital is going to accelerate. We\u2019ve seen this many times throughout history. And once capital fully accelerates to the point where we just say \u2014 say you have a small oligarchy of players that own all the capital in a given market \u2014 that\u2019s when you end up at something that Hillaire Belloc would have called the servile state. And in the servile state you have a small oligarchy that controls all the means of production, and they actually voluntarily throw benefits \u2014 they could be government benefits or private benefits, that distinction is useless for reasons we can talk about \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I find this insight to be amazing here!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Thank you! So they\u2019re gonna throw benefits down to the people that are not part of that oligopoly. And why do they do that? They do that because they have to do that! Because what would happen otherwise is \u2014 it would be in your benefit \u2014 if you\u2019re part of that surviving oligopoly, you still have to sell things to people! Because if you\u2019re not selling things to people, the whole thing comes to a grinding halt! You need people to have enough income that they can buy your stuff. So you\u2019re at least going to throw them enough benefits so that they\u2019re able to feed themselves, show up to work, and buy stuff. You need people to do that! You can\u2019t avoid the necessity of people doing that. So you will throw them enough scraps to be able to do so. And that\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing proposals like \u2014 the UBI is real popular nowadays. The UBI is not a socialist proposal, it\u2019s quite the opposite!

{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Yeah those ideas, Herbert Marcuse, all that stuff started in the mid to late 20th century. And those guys were CIA funded. The idea behind it was that it would move leftist energy away from socializing the means of production, and towards all these other ancillary issues. And that has become the dominant flavor of Marxism in the West that\u2019s taught in universities, etc. And that\u2019s what people generally believe when they say, Hey I\u2019m a Marxist. If you go back and actually read Marx\u2019s work, what\u2019s interesting about it is a couple things: (1) it has really nothing to do with any of that stuff. Marx\u2019s work is not even really about socialism. Marx\u2019s work is about capitalism. It\u2019s a description and a critique of capitalism is essentially what it is. It specifically really goes into the contradictions inherent within capitalism.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [42:42]: So does that make a Marxist anti-capitalism?"}

I don\u2019t think that you think that capitalism is perfect. I think we both agree that it\u2019s done a lot for the world in the 20th century, but I think what you\u2019re getting at is that it\u2019s run its course. The word you use is ourosboros \u2014 it eats itself."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux [43:34]: Right. It eats itself.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: So in that regard maybe Marx was right, or had some interesting points."}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Yeah so his critiques of capitalism were actually very interesting. The point I was trying to make is, he also died while he was still writing so we don\u2019t really know what he would have come up with if he had lived longer. His point was more so that \u2014 and I disagree with him on this point \u2014 that socialism, meaning a socialized means of production, was essentially inevitable due to all of these inherent contradictions within capitalism that he described. Some of which line up with the contradictions that I mentioned in my writing. Others of which don\u2019t. I don\u2019t agree with him that that made socialism inevitable because I think that the servile state is an alternative that the holders of capital would obviously strongly prefer and I do think is workable, unfortunately! I would wish it weren\u2019t workable but I do think that that is a workable system. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019s right about that, but his critiques of capitalism are very interesting. And you\u2019re right, if you actually went back and read Das Kapital or you read The Communist Manifesto or any of his other writings, it really wouldn\u2019t line up with what people that are ranting and raving on the Internet about being Marxist are talking about today. So the point where this whole conversation started was: there are really two groups of people that are pointing out what you just said, that a lot of these things like the UBI are really in full alignment with the largest holders of capital. The first group is the anti-capitalist right, which is a growing faction of people at least on the Internet and the intelligentsia. And they might not even necessarily always call themselves anti-capitalist, they\u2019re just not free market people.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: And they\u2019re on the right? Anti-capitalists on the right?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Yeah, and that can take on many different flavors. On some level I\u2019m probably part of that philosophically and ideologically. Because I am conservative. And (1) that\u2019s just a group of people \u2014 and they may not even all fully consider themselves anti-capitalist, but they\u2019re people that say, Hey if we want to have what we consider from a right-wing perspective to be a beneficial society, a free and unfettered market is not a way that we can do that. And there\u2019s a lot of different schools of thought. If you want to really dig into that world, American Affairs is a fantastic quarterly publication that I would put in that category. And they have a very broad breadth of thought, people that consider themselves anti-capitalist versus capitalist reformist, those things probably in practice aren\u2019t really all that different. And they even have some socialist writers sometimes. But American Affairs is a right-wing publication. But definitely not a free markets publication! That is not American Affairs\u2019 perspective. And that\u2019s been around for a few years and it\u2019s been growing like crazy. A lot of good intellectual energy behind it. So that\u2019s one group of people that you\u2019ll see making that exact same connection that you\u2019re making. And that\u2019s starting to bleed over into mainstream politics just a tiny teensy teensy teensy little bit. You will hear Josh Hawley for instance say a watered down version of things that you might read in American Affairs. You\u2019ll see Tom Cotton say a very watered down version of things you might see in American Affairs. So they\u2019re not really there, but you can see where this is going. The (2) other group of people are the people that still stick to the old religion Marxism. I don\u2019t want to get into terminology fights because a lot of them will quibble with what I\u2019m about to say. A lot of those people are now referring to themselves as post-leftists to distinguish themselves from the mainstream left. Some people don\u2019t like that term. Some of them prefer to be called left populists. Those are the two groups of people that you really see doing that. If you want to get a good flavor of some of that thought \u2014 and again it\u2019s a very broad area of thought, not all of them are going to agree, many of them would even disagree with the way I\u2019m categorizing them \u2014 you want to read something like The Bellows, which is an online publication which is really great, really fantastic! What\u2019s Left is a really great podcast that\u2019s of that general genre. My friends \u2014 who I was actually just livestreaming with before I came onto this podcast \u2014 the Good Ol Boys kind of do a fusion. I don\u2019t know if they would describe it this way but they do a fusion of those two camps that I talked about. People that are on the right and the people that are in that post-left area, they straddle those two and do a synthesis of those two. For listeners that want to get a better idea of that school of thought that\u2019s out there and developing, those are some resources that you can look at.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [49:16]: I know you\u2019ve touched on this in your writing but I\u2019m curious: how does inflation and the Cantillion effect influence your thoughts? And what do you think would happen with capitalism today if we didn\u2019t have inflation, if we were on a hard money system?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: So one of my controversial thoughts is that you actually can\u2019t have a hard money system long term in capitalism! Because once capital is concentrated enough in a few enough hands that are powerful enough, they\u2019re gonna use some mechanism to control the money supply. Why wouldn\u2019t you? If anyone has the power to do that, you\u2019d be crazy not to do it! It\u2019s in your own interest to do so.

Can you walk us through your other article Charity, Welfare, and Usury: The Capitalist Paradox. I do agree with you that we\u2019re in the usury era. What was the charity era, the welfare era, and the usury era\u2014that I think and agree that we\u2019re in now?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: In early capitalism \u2014 when I say early capitalism I\u2019m talking post-industrial revolution up until before the New Deal \u2014 you had a competitive market. Distributists, which Belloc and Chesterton are probably most famous, have this concept called the capitalist paradox. It basically means when you have this free market going on \u2014 and I\u2019m not adapting this to the modern day, they wrote over a hundred years ago \u2014 the way you would apply the capitalist paradox to more modern ideas and even in their times was: if you\u2019ve got this competitive market, your goal is to be the last one standing. You\u2019re constantly competing. And the way you want to do that is by cutting costs. If you can offer an equivalent good or service and you can offer it cheaper, you\u2019re gonna win. So what\u2019s the easiest way to cut your costs? It\u2019s just to pay your employees less! It\u2019s like a no-brainer. Typically in a market you wanna pay your employees as low as possible while still getting them to show up to work and do their job appropriately, right? So what\u2019s the problem with that? If everybody keeps cutting their employees\u2019 pay to try to compete with each other, eventually you\u2019re gonna get to the point where the employee class or the working class, they\u2019re just subsisting. They\u2019re able to like feed themselves and clothe themselves and get to work, and that\u2019s about it. They\u2019re not gonna be able to buy your stuff! And that\u2019s a problem, because if capital is concentrated such that let\u2019s say only five people have it, well those five people only need so many shoes, no matter how luxurious their lifestyle might be. But if that capital is spread across five million people, they\u2019re gonna buy a lot more shoes! So the paradox is that by trying to get ahead you end up impoverishing all of your customers and they can\u2019t buy your stuff anymore. That\u2019s in a nutshell a very simplified version of the capitalist paradox. So the system \u2014 and when I say the system that can be a governmental system or a non-governmental system, it doesn\u2019t really matter because in a capitalist society a governmental system is gonna be run by the larger holders of capital so they can collude privately or they can collude publicly via government, the government is just a collusion mechanism \u2014 they are gonna have to find a way to funnel stuff back to the working classes so that they can keep buying things. The initial way that that was done early on was through charity. You were a really rich guy, a Carnegie or a Rockefeller, you would have all these charitable endeavors. And these charitable endeavors that were meant to help the poor, what they were really doing was just sort of recirculating capital back downwards to keep the system going. You had to find a way to constantly recirculate that capital downwards. And that charity stuff lasted for a while, but the problem was there\u2019s not a formal mechanism to make sure that all my other rich friends are giving as much to charity as I am. That can work for a while but eventually that\u2019s going to break down. It\u2019s not sufficient anymore to recycle that capital back down to the working classes. So what we did next was the mid-century era which was the New Deal in the United States and other similar social democracy programs in Europe. What they did was they actually implemented formalized systems through the government. Systems like social security \u2014 which I\u2019m not even opposed to social security \u2014 but that was the point of it. That was the motivation behind it. Just welfare! Stuff like food stamps, general welfare payments, all that stuff really took off in the mid-20th century. That was the idea behind it. That was the mechanism to recycle that down. And that worked really well for a while, particularly because during that era you had two things going on. You had that welfare system, but you also actually had systems to gain workers more power like unionization that also came about in that era. But what happened after: the power systems for workers broke down first, and then eventually the welfare re-circulation systems broke down. There was welfare reform in the 90s, a lot of those benefits started to get cut! At the same time, you had off-shoring going on so people\u2019s wages went down even further. So that welfare system remained in place to some extent but it wasn\u2019t cutting it anymore. Not enough capital was getting re-circulated down. So what happened in the phase that started from the 90s to the phase we\u2019re still in today, and that\u2019s the usury system where you just lend it to them! These people are basically living on a borrowed lifestyle, right? We\u2019re a debt-based society! So that\u2019s another way you can funnel capital back down to them and then they are able to then use that. They\u2019re not obviously using it as capital, investing it. They\u2019re just using it to spend to live or on consumable items. So that\u2019s the other way to do it. And the usury system is really advantageous to them because they get to charge interest, right? So not only do they make money on selling you stuff, but they make money on the fact that they gave you money to buy it to begin with! So money is being made at all angles there when you\u2019re dealing with a usury system. [57:13] And I should point out here that usury\u2014I\u2019m using Hillaire Belloc\u2019s definition of the term. Usury nowadays we define as charging an amount of interest that\u2019s so high that it\u2019s unethical or illegal. But that\u2019s not what it meant in the distributist tradition. It essentially meant any loan that was for a consumable asset. So a mortgage would not have necessarily \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah I believe a 30-year mortgage should be illegal."}

{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Yeah and it can be depending on the terms. I\u2019ll give you a more clear-cut example. If you took out an equipment loan to buy a machine for your business, that loan would not be usury. Because you\u2019re using it for productive purpose. However, credit card debt that you use to buy food, no matter how low the interest is, that\u2019s still considered usury under this school of thought \u2014 that that should be illegal, that sort of lending should be against the law.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: And your home is consumption. It\u2019s not an investment! I mean it shouldn\u2019t be seen as an investment. You live there, you\u2019re consuming that asset."}

I do fundamentally agree with you there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: And only because of low interest rates and 30-year mortgages and money printing has it been an investment!

{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: You could define that a million different ways.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Well how do you define it? You call yourself one! It\u2019s considered probably a dirty word! I don\u2019t know many people running around saying I\u2019m a populist!"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: It just means that you view the point of governance to be fundamentally for the people. Meaning that\u2014it\u2019s rhetorical in a lot of ways. It could be just the way that you speak, is that the whole point of what we\u2019re doing is for the people, but not for any abstraction. In other words, we\u2019re not running a government to increase GDP or based on some ideological concern like, We just view a free market as inherently good because it\u2019s inherently good and that\u2019s how we run our government. A populist, you\u2019d look at what really is benefiting actually the people regardless of your ideological concerns. That is your primary concern I think when you\u2019re a populist! To me, and there are left populists and right populists and all different sorts of populism, but to me it implies a national worker state. Meaning a government based in nationalism which should not be a dirty word. Nationalism doesn\u2019t have to be racist, it doesn\u2019t have to be anything like that. The point of the government should be essentially to represent the workers in all forms. Which also includes \u2014 this is where I\u2019m not a Marxist \u2014 self-employed people who work! Self-employed typically do work in their business. They are also workers. They\u2019re a different class of workers than employees are. They have different concerns, they take different risks, etc.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: How do you frame up the difference between, or the goals of sovereignty versus populism? Thinking about others versus taking care of yourself?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux: Yeah that\u2019s a great point. There\u2019s a duality there where in your personal life it makes sense to be a libertarian because you\u2019re gonna have the best life if you look at the world through the lens of, Everything\u2019s on me, I gotta do the best I can. When I fail it\u2019s my fault. That sort of thinking is gonna get you far in life on a personal level. It also is an insane way to run a government! In that you\u2019re just gonna have a situation where you\u2019re gonna have a few winners that come out dominating everyone else. And that is self-contradictory but I don\u2019t have any answer to that contradiction. It sorta is what it is.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: How do you frame up distributism if we\u2019re gonna define it? I\u2019ll let you know what I\u2019ve gathered from it because I listen to you on other podcasts and I ran home and I told my wife about it. And the way I frame it up is, We\u2019re gonna distribute economic ownership \u2014 maybe not property ownership \u2014 throughout the population. And I use the example of Amazon. Amazon gets so big! So once it achieves a certain size \u2014 I don\u2019t know how we determine that size \u2014but you\u2019re like, Okay, we need to have 20% of the employees represented on the board of directors. In that scenario and I\u2019m paraphrasing you, now we\u2019re not gonna have 2-day delivery because I\u2019m not gonna piss and shit in my pants, I\u2019m not gonna wear diapers as an employee, so we\u2019re gonna be on a 4-day delivery. Everyone\u2019s not gonna get what they want, or the most supreme service, but we\u2019re gonna balance by not having people wearing diapers in a factory or old people commuting to the best jobs around the country to work in Amazon factories \u2014 whatever it is! How do I build it out more than that?"}
{"prompt": "Jeff Vandroux [1:04:37]: Yeah, sure! So, distributism is primarily just an ideal. Meaning, saying that you respect private property so that\u2019s where it makes it a little bit different from a communist for instance. You very much respect private property, but you wanna use the legal system to corral the market such that private property remains very widely distributed. And that capital itself maintains wide distribution, which a free market\u2019s not gonna provide that. So you need a system in place to hamper the market, essentially so that such a thing can happen! And distributists throughout the hundred-year history of it have had a lot of different ideas about the best the way to do that. So it\u2019s hard to say, Oh this is a distributist policy over versus this isn\u2019t. I can tell you the ones that I think are good ideas, but many people that call themselves distributists would disagree very much with my ideas, because it\u2019s moreso an ideal that\u2019s never been fully implemented. So from my perspective, what might that look like in the real world? I\u2019m gonna answer that first into things you could actually do within the next 30 years that are marginally realistic, and then we could talk about pie in the sky stuff, right? Those are two different aspects that we can look at. When we\u2019re talking about this, first of all it\u2019s important to understand the concept of subsidiarity which is different from pure decentralization. Subsidiarity means power is exercised at the lowest level in which it can be effectively exercised. Not the lowest level altogether! Because if you fully decentralize things, what usually ends up happening is the strongest guy in this little decentralized world will essentially end up dominating everybody else and you\u2019ll end right up back in a centralized system! A free market is decentralized at the beginning, and that\u2019s what happens! Subsidiarity says, You push just enough power up the different levels of government such that everybody is still getting a piece. That\u2019s the idea behind this system. Everybody gets a little piece of what\u2019s going on, and it\u2019s in everybody\u2019s interest to keep that higher level of authority running such that everybody\u2019s still getting their piece, and no one can dominate that higher level of government. That\u2019s easier said than done! But I\u2019ll give you some examples of things that would move a little bit closer to a distributist ideal but are still somewhat realistic. Number one would be, as you said \u2014 first of all tax and regulatory policy that favors non-public small family businesses over large publically traded businesses. And that\u2019s just a value judgment. So if you\u2019re a libertarian and you\u2019re hearing that, that sounds insane! No, I\u2019m actually saying the legal system should discriminate against businesses that are held that way, and in favor of the smaller ones even if they are less efficient, to a degree that\u2019s acceptable. There are some businesses like a utility company can\u2019t necessarily operate that way. But your tax and regulatory structure in fact benefits directly those types of businesses. When you\u2019re talking about larger businesses that really can\u2019t operate that way \u2014 let me give concrete examples. Restaurants would be a good example of that! There is no benefit to having a Chili\u2019s on every corner versus family restaurants in every town. There just isn\u2019t, that\u2019s stupid! On the other end of the spectrum, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily want a different cell phone company in every town. That would be difficult, just the nature of that industry. So when you\u2019re talking about those industries that don\u2019t lend themselves to that, those industries just have to be very regulated, and there\u2019s a variety of different ways that you can do that. You mentioned one where those industries are gonna have to give their workers seats on the board. Because that is a form of distributed control, even if it\u2019s not \u2014 ideally you would want companies like that to be co-ops. That\u2019s the ideal. Co-ops are essentially a business where the workers own it. It\u2019s not socialism because there\u2019s still a market in play. We don\u2019t all in a society own AT&T, but AT&T\u2019s employees own AT&T, T-Mobile\u2019s employees own T-Mobile, but it\u2019s still run like a corporation. They elect a board of directors and there\u2019s still a president. And this is a business model that does exist! Mondragon is an industrial cooperative, a very large one in Spain, that operates that way: their employees own the business. That doesn\u2019t mean everyone gets paid the same. The janitor doesn\u2019t get paid the same as the CEO does. But there are ways to make that work. That\u2019s the ideal, but it would be really hard to transition to that system right away, or anytime in the near future. In the meantime, what Germans call the co-determination system because they do this in their country, is a step in the right direction, is the best that we could do right now. And that system says: once your company is over a certain size \u2014 and that\u2019s an arbitrary line \u2014 your employees are gonna elect a board of directors. You\u2019re not gonna operate solely for your shareholders anymore. Your employees are gonna have a seat at this table, they\u2019re gonna have actual agency over their jobs and what they do everyday. That\u2019s a baby-step in that direction when we can\u2019t get to that co-op level. Something that I\u2019ve been sold on too is a move more towards corporatist government, corporatist in the tripartite tradition. And if you wanna learn more about that American Affairs maybe two issues ago, Michael Lind wrote an article about tripartite corporatism. It\u2019s ironic that I\u2019m citing him because he\u2019s not a distributist, he actually likes very centralized businesses. But tripartite corporatism is not limited to that sort of a system. A tripartite corporatist system is one where \u2014 right now administrative agencies that set regulations for our business environment are just staffed by career bureaucrats. That\u2019s how it works. In a corporatist system, it wouldn\u2019t work that way! Let\u2019s say the division of the agency that is controlling wireless telecommunication \u2014 instead of being staffed by bureaucrats what would happen is the government would legally sanction and recognize a union that represented all of the telecommunications workers. The workers actually would not be required to join the union. If they don\u2019t want to pay dues \u2014 France does this by the way, it\u2019s not a pie in the sky thing \u2014 they don\u2019t have to join the union. If they don\u2019t want to pay dues, they don\u2019t get to vote. The union allows elections but they don\u2019t have to join! [1:13:06] This union is sanctioned by the government, and then the employers would have their own industry association also sanctioned by the government. And then consumers in that particular industry would also have an organization sanctioned by the government. I\u2019m describing it a little bit differently than Lind does, but it\u2019s the same general idea as Lind envisions this. And those three entities, all who have competing interests, would sit down at the table and hammer out the regulatory structure that is best for the three of them! Instead of the bureaucrat that is detached from the consequences of his actions, right? So the union is obviously incentivized to hammer out the best deal for the employees. The employers association is incentivized to hammer out the best deal in the regulatory environment for the employer. Now if you had just those two, they might agree to screw consumers, right? So that\u2019s the third leg of the stool here in terms of who are actually coming up with the regulatory environments for these businesses. And they hammer out a regulatory environment that works for all three of them! And it\u2019s an everybody gets a piece system. It\u2019s actually fundamentally a patronage system! Where everybody\u2019s just looking out for their own interests and using the government to patronize themselves. But because you have competing interests that are opposed to one another, everybody\u2019s competing to make sure they still get their piece. Everybody gets a piece! That\u2019s the overarching thing here.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: So where do you think we\u2019re going in 2021?"}

We have not been on such a path for some time which just means that the debt is growing much faster than the economy. This is not the time to act on those concerns! This is the time to use the great fiscal power of the United States to do what we can to support the economy and try to get through this with as little damage to the longer run productive capacity of the economy as possible. The time will come again\u2014and reasonably soon I think \u2014 where we can think about a long term way to get our fiscal house in order and we absolutely need to do that!

{"prompt": "Preston Pysh: No I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a sham! Back in January, when I started tweeting about this at the end of January\u2014maybe at the beginning of February when it actually came out \u2014 with Eric Townsend, I mean we were laying into this saying this was gonna be a really big deal. And dude, we got so much \u2014 I mean everyone was furious! I mean furious! I had people just \u2014 you just can\u2019t imagine the feedback we were getting! Saying, You\u2019re an alarmist! Nothing\u2019s even happened! Oh that\u2019s only in a small town in China, and this and that. I mean I was just watching the video feeds out of China, in Wuhan in particular, which is a town that\u2019s bigger than New York City. And people just have to put that in perspective. This is a town that\u2019s bigger than New York City! And the firsthand account videos that were slipping out underneath of the firewall were crazy! Just total madness! You know, in the military, they send you through biochem exercises. They\u2019ll take you, they\u2019ll throw you in a tent, it\u2019s got CS gas inside there, they\u2019ll take, Take off your mask. And you gotta breathe this CS gas in. You\u2019ve got all this snot, everything is just coming out of your nose, because what it is effectively is like really fine shards of glass that you\u2019re breathing in when you\u2019re breathing in CS gas. So I\u2019ve been through these types of exercises. I\u2019ve done that in the military, and let me tell you, I know exactly what it looks like. And everything that I was seeing coming out of China was that! It was these kinds of exercises! [05:37] So whenever I saw everybody geared up in that type of equipment, in this \u2014 they call it Mopp level 4 or 5 or whatever that they were wearing over t here\u2014 to me I was saying, This is really bad! And if this goes where I think this is gonna go\u2014and you were looking at the supply chains just completely shutting down in China \u2014 this is gonna be really bad! So early on I was very concerned about this! Now that it\u2019s here in the States, do I think that every single state should be shut down in the way that they\u2019re shut down based on the amount of the cases that are there? Another reference to the military \u2014 they say, Distribute the authority to the lowest level possible, let those people make informed decisions. And what you\u2019re gonna find is that you perform the best that way! So I think when you look at how it\u2019s being handled here in the U.S., I think New York has major issues in the hospitals. They\u2019ve gotta push that \u2014 I mean because it all comes down to your bottleneck, which is at the hospitals right? Their hospitals are at max capacity, they\u2019re having all sorts of issues. So in that area it\u2019s terrible! You go to other parts of the country it\u2019s not bad at all, so why are these people not having the ability to work? And I think it really needs to be governed by the governors of each of these states, then it needs to be pushed down to the local communities as to how they\u2019re dealing with it. And I think if they just took that approach they might find that maybe the impact to the economy wouldn\u2019t be nearly as bad. Is that what you\u2019re getting at with your question?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard [07:16]: Yeah absolutely. It was a deliberately vague and wide-ranging question! On the point of the pushback that you got from people about accusing you of being an alarmist \u2014 why do you think that is? Do you think it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had false alarms before? With I think Ebola, you know, they made a big deal out of it and then that was like nothing. So people maybe were trained to think that the boy cried wolf?

Well a lot of people would hear that and probably think, What a dweeb\u2014not being able to shut up about Bitcoin. It\u2019s true! But at the same time Mark Cuban was actually quite interested in the discussion! We ended up having quite a long discussion, it was like 15 minutes standing outside going back and forth. But he was taking positions like, The Federal Reserve is doing a great job, and we don\u2019t even really need to replace it. And Bitcoin can\u2019t replace it anyway. The real thing is blockchain technology, yadda yadda yadda. He ended up giving me his e-mail address to follow up, but by the time I got around to getting over the fact that I was accosting billionaires in the street and getting their e-mails for telling them they\u2019re wrong, it dawned on me that, Eh! I\u2019m a broke college kid! I really don\u2019t need a billionaire buying the Bitcoins that I wish that I could buy! So because of that I never even e-mailed him! But the years go on and he pops out and continues to say stupid things. And it\u2019s in this really annoying fashion! Because he does give lip service to the technology! He says like, Oh! The blockchain technology! At the time in 2014 he was pumping Cyberdust or something, and it was some chat app based on the blockchain, and we\u2019re supposed to take that seriously. I can even imagine him trying to paint himself as not really being anti-Bitcoin, but he\u2019s such a normie about it, it\u2019s disgusting! I finally made use of his e-mail back in September where I sent him a long e-mail talking about stock to flow and saying, Look, we can see Bitcoin be $100,000 by December 2021 and I left it at that. He actually responded quickly, I sent an even better response to him, never heard back from that of course. But I just needed an on-the-record, like, Remember who told you! I just always want to dangle that over him because that\u2019s just how it is. Also, he owns the Mavericks and I\u2019m originally from San Antonio, so he was just unacceptable on all fronts!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [14:30]: I mean, this is the moment where we\u2019ve gotta brand what the fundamental flaw is. Because \u2014 in my very humble opinion \u2014 there\u2019s a very obvious flaw in his thinking. Viewing this narrative \u2014 this is the Cuban paradox. It\u2019s this idea \u2014 and it goes back to the Twitter war I had with him I don\u2019t know how long ago. But his comment all revolved around this idea that he allowed people to pay in his stadium with Bitcoin. And at the end of the first year he had like $600 of people that paid to go to his game with Bitcoin. So his deduction at that point is, Nobody\u2019s using this! And therefore it\u2019s never gonna catch on! And therefore the price will never go up! And that\u2019s his thesis. And I think for anybody who \u2014 I guess this is me throwing him a bone and like empathizing with his position because I think for most people that are just at the micro-level, they\u2019re at, Hey I own this billion-dollar company or I own this $500 million dollar company or I own this $1 million dollar company. The only thing that really processes in their brain is this, Well if you don\u2019t have people using it and there\u2019s no utility well then the price is never gonna go up, there\u2019s no one that\u2019s going to bid the price up higher, and then that\u2019s the end of their analysis. But I think on this one there\u2019s a very deep fundamental flaw in that thinking, because they\u2019re not understanding what it\u2019s trying to achieve at its most root and intrinsic level. And so what I would tell you \u2014 in my humble opinion \u2014 what it\u2019s solving is it\u2019s pegging global central banks. All of them \u2014 it\u2019s pegging them. It\u2019s literally pinning them to a wall, and saying, There\u2019s not gonna be any more of that! And if there is, you\u2019re gonna be held accountable to it! That\u2019s what this is all about! That is Mission One! If you\u2019re gonna list out all the missions on a piece of paper, Mission One cannot be triumphed by anything else! You cannot put the idea of, All these people in third world countries paying with Bitcoin above it first pegging global fiat money that these global central bankers continue to debase \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: It\u2019d be at the expense of those people by the way.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh: Yeah exactly! You cannot out-prioritize that! That mission has to be accomplished \u2014 no matter what \u2014 before anything else can take place! So if you don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s important\u2014which I would argue, tons of people do not understand why that\u2019s important because when you dig into it it\u2019s really complex as why that has to happen \u2014 I have been promoting the living hell out of this book, but I\u2019m gonna do it right now, but that\u2019s why people need to read this flipping book: this book is called The Price of Tomorrow by Jeff Booth. And when you read this book you\u2019ll gain an understanding as to why Mission One has to be accomplished first and foremost before anything else. You can\u2019t compromise on that! At all! If you compromise on that, there\u2019s gonna be some other protocol that\u2019s gonna rise up and be more important. [18:04] So when you look at, Well why does Bitcoin accomplish that over everything else, you can get into a lot of the reasons why, but if I was gonna summarize real quickly: Bitcoin just annihilates all the competition! And so going back to the Cuban paradox: the idea is, Well, if people aren\u2019t using it in my stadium and if there\u2019s no utility for people to use it then how in the world is the price gonna go up? Well I\u2019ll tell you how the price is gonna go up. We\u2019ve got this quantitative hardening happening here in May: the halvening, right? So these miners that are gonna mine the living hell out of this. Look at how much hashing is coming online in this two-week adjustment that we\u2019re at right now. We\u2019re over 10% leading into this thing, and the price has been, not spectacular. I mean it took the big hit, it had a significant bounce, but the price has just been kinda hanging around. So you have to ask yourself: Why in the hell are all these people bringing more rigs online to the tune of 10% of the entire network on this two-week difficulty adjustment that we have. What is it that they know that no one else understands? Well here\u2019s what they understand, is that as soon as that halving event happens, all these people that are spooling up these S17 mining rigs\u2014guess what? They\u2019ve got huge margins! Massive margins! And guess what? They don\u2019t have to sell! They do not have to sell even after you take that reward and you cut it in half! You\u2019re pumping out half as much reward and guess what? They\u2019re still in the money! [19:48] They still got margin! And they\u2019re gonna continue to mine. They\u2019re gonna mine the living crap out of it! And not only are they gonna mine it, but they\u2019re gonna sell less in order to offset and pay for their electrical bills than the people running the S9s that dropped out of the market beforehand. And guess what that does to the price? It drives it higher! Okay so everybody who heard me say that, what pops into their head is they say \u2014 the argument that I constantly hear whenever you spew that narrative that I just spewed \u2014 they say, Well, when you look at how much the miners are selling on the market, it\u2019s a pittance compared to the overall transactions for the whole network. That\u2019s what you hear! Well guess what? You\u2019re using the wrong ratio when you\u2019re talking about that! The real ratio you need to talk about is, How much are those miners putting onto the market to sell to recoup their electrical costs versus the amount of fiat that\u2019s coming in versus the amount of BTC in people that are leaving that network? That net difference between the people coming and the people going is in the denominator of that ratio. Not the total transactions. And so when you change that denominator to the thing that actually matters, which is the net difference between people coming and going out of the network, all of a sudden you have a very big number relative to the amount of selling that\u2019s taking place to the miners. Which therefore means, they\u2019re driving that floor in the price! And I can\u2019t tell you how many people miss that. People do not understand that, at all! That\u2019s my opinion as to why this event that\u2019s getting ready to happen in May \u2014 and it might take a month, it might take two months for the gears to really click and to ratchet in, but when they do, the thing just takes off! Because the miners that are inefficient are completely out of the game at that point. That flow is not being sold into the market like it was before."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [22:33]: On the demand side I think a good way of visualizing it is Unchained Capital\u2019s HODL waves, where they show the aging schedule of Bitcoin outputs basically showing that, These coins have not moved for more than a year. And you see that percentage increasing! That to me is a better way of thinking about the demand side than when people look at like the exchange trade volume, and they say, Oh okay, well Bitcoin mining is a tiny percentage of exchange trade volume \u2014 the trading going on. Whereas to me the Unchained Capital HODL waves of people withdrawing from the exchange and putting it on their cold storage, that is real demand!

But for me, that\u2019s the only thing that I can think of that makes sense, and why you consistently see this floor being set. When you plot this price chart on a logarithmic scale since the inception of Bitcoin, why in the hell does it plot so perfectly in mathematical terms as far as the curve that you see? The only thing that I can come to the conclusion is, is that these miners are setting the floor. And the floor is completely based on that flow that\u2019s being dropped into the market."}

{"prompt": "Preston Pysh: It\u2019s funny that you say that because my comment back to Mark when he kept bringing this Cuban Paradox up is I said, Mark, you\u2019re gonna change your mind when the market cap of Bitcoin passes $1 Trillion, and you\u2019re continuing to collect $600 at your games, if you\u2019re assuming that he can continue to accept Bitcoin as a transaction. Because the thing that\u2019s driving it is not necessarily the utility at sporting events or at coffee stores or any of this stuff! The thing that\u2019s driving it \u2014 going back to what I described earlier \u2014 you have these miners that are running new equipment that have huge margins that accept this reduction in the amount of coins that they\u2019re mining, and so they\u2019re selling less back into the market and then the price starts going up because you don\u2019t have as much selling pressure. So now once it starts taking off, guess what? All these speculators then step into the market! And then it becomes a speculative thing at that point. So where that transition occurs \u2014 I have no freaking clue! I have no idea where that transition occurs! But it\u2019s just human psychology! It\u2019s just how humans react when they start seeing the price go up and you\u2019ve got every freaking person on the street walking up to you and saying, Hey! You know something about Bitcoin doncha? Right? That\u2019s when you know that the speculators are in the game! Is when that starts happening! When you start getting the e-mails from people that you haven\u2019t talked to in 15 years and they\u2019re like, Hey dude! How\u2019s it going? Right? You know that the mining is not driving the price at that point! The speculators, the people that want a quick turn, a quick buck, the people that have no clue how any of this works, but they just want to make a quick buck! And that drives the cycle for a significant period of time! I have no idea how long! But it drives it from that point. And I would tell you, anytime it passes the previous all-time high, it gets wild! It gets crazy!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Goldstein [26:48]: Yeah last time I think near the top by $15,000, I was definitely hearing from people I had not heard from in quite a while.

{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: So that\u2019s assuming also that everything is hunky-dory in the fiat world, and that we\u2019re just looking at Bitcoin as just an endogenous process. Which I think has been the right way to look at it for the past decade. But we haven\u2019t seen Bitcoin go through a financial crisis yet! And there\u2019s been speculation that Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, it\u2019s basically just like the tech-Tamagotchi thing that \u2014 if there\u2019s a liquidity crisis in the system \u2014 then Bitcoin\u2019s gonna crash. That I think has been reflected by its correlation with the S&P500 since the start of the real reaction to COVID-19 and the financial markets. But I actually think that if you look at, for example, the Sharpe ratio for a 4-year holding period: the Sharpe ratio for stocks has crashed! Whereas the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin hasn\u2019t really moved very much at all. That to me is like, There is in fact a disconnect here, and Bitcoin is actually proving to be a better store of value even if the short-term people on Twitter can\u2019t really see it that way. And that it did bounce back so quickly after the March 12th liquidation that went down to like $3,600. The leverage in the Bitcoin system had already been wiped out in December of 2018. And then it kind of got rebuilt April to July of 2019. Then it got wiped out again March 12th. But now at $7,000 and holding steady, it feels like Bitcoin is undervalued, while stocks are still overvalued! [29:42]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh: I just think that when you look at the volatility that you\u2019re gonna see in the stock market moving forward, it\u2019s gonna be way higher than what we\u2019ve seen historically. Just because \u2014 now that they\u2019re not just using QE, which was the primary means of insertion for the last decade, now they\u2019re using UBI! And now they\u2019re gonna have to coordinate both of those together. I was always of the opinion this was gonna happen! This was just a matter of when it\u2019d happen. I would have that conversation with some people when I told them, Hey! Even if Trump would be re-elected, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me in the least bit that UBI would become a thing! And people would look at me and they\u2019d say, You are off your rocker! You are nuts! I said, It\u2019s just a function of the math, man! There\u2019s only so much you can insert into the markets and everything that\u2019s happening, because your typical person is looking at this and saying, Oh! Well this is just because of that virus that all this is happening! Whereas, Dude \u2014 this has been in the works for decades! For just flipping decades! So now it comes down to \u2014 I mean, look at the NASDAQ. The NASDAQ\u2019s booming! I mean it has a Bitcoin-like bounce to it! I think people that are looking at this and saying this is gonna be a Great Depression-like scenario, I think they\u2019re forgetting that when you look at the charts from \u2014 and it absolutely could be that, so please don\u2019t take this comment as me waiving that, that it couldn\u2019t happen \u2014 I just think that the range of potential outcomes is much wider as to what we might see moving forward. When you go back to 1929, you didn\u2019t come off the gold standard until 1933. So you had this peg in place through that downturn, that 3-year, 4-year grind from 1929 to 1933, and during that entire period of time you were working with a pegged currency. You don\u2019t have that right now! Not only do you not have it in the US, you don\u2019t have it anywhere! [32:30] So that\u2019s where I think people that are immediately going to an analogous comparison to that, I don\u2019t think that they\u2019re necessarily widening their aperture far enough! I think it\u2019s wider than that! And the fact that they\u2019re throwing as much money as they\u2019re throwing at this, and \u2014 I hate talking politics, because I am politics agnostic, 100% \u2014 I don\u2019t think you can be successful in the markets unless you\u2019re politics agnostic. I prefaced that before I say this: When you look at how Trump\u2019s gonna respond to this, I think he\u2019s gonna respond to this with literally everything he can possibly throw at it, times 10! And so if that\u2019s a true statement, I mean, you could see people out of the labor market, highest unemployment numbers you\u2019ve ever seen in your life, and I think you could see the market come back to numbers that you saw before any of this happened, even with people out of work! And I don\u2019t think anybody is pricing that potential in! And I think that that is a potential! I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s a high potential, but I think it\u2019s a potential. So what does that mean? And this is going off of what Pierre was saying earlier: this means crazy volatility! So if you\u2019re looking at risk-adjusted returns compared to that volatility \u2014 yeah! You should see the Sharpe ratio for the stock market get crushed! Right? Because not only are you not making any real returns from where this thing started, but now you\u2019re clocking in this massive amount of volatility, and no one knows where the hell it\u2019s going next! It\u2019s completely dependent on government intervention! I mean it has been for the last ten years whether people want to believe that or not! That\u2019s just a fact. I\u2019m not trying to be tinfoil anything, it\u2019s just a pure fact that when you pump that much QE into the system, you haven\u2019t let up since 2009, you go clear up to the brink where everything falls apart, and then you\u2019re not only doing QE but then you\u2019re doing UBI to the tune of $2,000 a month until unemployment goes back to the lowest levels we ever saw since the 1950's-1960's \u2014 is how long they\u2019re saying they would keep that on \u2014 this stuff is crazy! This is total, absolute, unprecedented debasement at the nth degree that will literally make people\u2019s minds explode! Like that\u2019s how much debasement we\u2019re talking about!"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [34:38]: And it\u2019s not even political in the sense that it\u2019s extremely bi-partisan! You\u2019ve got everyone from Nancy Pelosi to Ted Cruz agreeing on, This is what needs to be done! The only person that disagrees is Thomas Massey, and he was savaged and attacked by both the president \u2014 who is of his own party \u2014 saying that Thomas Massey needs to be kicked out of the Republican party, to obviously the Democrats piling in on that. Yeah it\u2019s extremely bi-partisan that this is the right course of action, because this was what the whole system was designed to do in a crisis! In an Austrian economics system, where you have a deflationary money, people would be holding much higher real cash balances. And I think the inflationary system has actually ironically pushed down cash balances relative to crisis, and then when you enter into a cash-flow problem like we have here, there\u2019s no reserves! And so you have to create new money to pave over the problem.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [35:59]: The thing that no one talks about, especially those in academia do not talk about this \u2014 and that\u2019s where it needs to be addressed \u2014 this is where all of this should be learned, is counter-opinions to the status quo! The thing that no one talks about is when you have an inflationary monetary policy which we\u2019ve had for eons, basically since Bretton-Woods. Even when we were on a gold standard from 1944 up until 1971, I would aggressively argue that you were on an inflationary monetary policy because of the debasement that took place through the money multiplier against the gold that was sitting in the reserves. That\u2019s a whole other conversation. So if we buy that argument that we\u2019ve been in this inflationary monetary policy since 1944, well what happens is you set up this incentive structure around that inflationary monetary policy. And when you have that incentive structure set in place for that long, you get the craziness, especially at the tail end of this thing, which is exactly where we\u2019re at right now, you have this incentive structures that are not pointing towards each other and that are self-reinforcing, but now that are actually the opposite way and they\u2019re self-ripping apart of each other! And the only way that I can possibly see that fixing itself in a way that doesn\u2019t involve mass social unrest, is for some type of deflationary force to step in from a monetary policy standpoint in order to slow that down. Because you\u2019re going so fast you\u2019re literally hitting the speed of light as far as productivity \u2014 sliding productivity to the left due to inflationary monetary policy. Because that\u2019s what it does is it slides productivity to the left so that the spaceships\u2019 doors are ripping off, the whole thing is basically coming unglued. You\u2019re going so fast, you\u2019re approaching the speed of light, that everything\u2019s being ripped apart!"}

Yeah so I actually kind of agree with you Pierre in many ways. I have this meta-feeling towards history where considering how much of politics has always been about getting your hands on control of the money. I know there\u2019s the classic Rothchild quote about, Give me control of the money and I care not who makes the laws. But Nick Szabo had a great set of Tweets once about, All of the wars that were really just plundering gold vaults. You go forward to the 19th century and people don\u2019t talk about this much but one of the pillars in the Communist Manifesto was literally full state control of banking and credit because they wanted to do things like what we see today! And a lot of these sort of battles of political ideologies in the 20th century were also \u2014 as far as I can tell \u2014 almost like trying to control the banking system, the money underneath that. In today\u2019s world you\u2019re going to want to have control of that and keep doing whatever you need for this thing to survive, and anything that goes against what you\u2019re saying is going to put a halt to this system, so you\u2019re gonna keep doubling down on that power unless you see that alternative, which is why it\u2019s so embarrassing to see people like Thomas Massey, who\u2019s actually usually like a great defender of freedom and stuff, but it\u2019s embarrassing to take that frame of trying to stand athwart fiat money saying, Stop! Instead you need to just look for the next gold vault, the next monetary system, so that you can just exit altogether!

Now you\u2019ve got something that\u2019s very different.

Huh? Uh, how are they doing that? And how can that last? Um, how is that possible? How does that not have some type of impact? And so their guard is up and they\u2019re saying, This could be bad, but so far it doesn\u2019t seem like it is! So when that guard goes up they\u2019re looking for, Where could this go bad? Where is something that just doesn\u2019t make sense? And then all of a sudden a year from now you\u2019re gonna see Bitcoin blow through $100,000 probably next summer, right? And when they see that, and they see all this printing that\u2019s been taking place every single month, and they know not only all these companies getting bailed out, but you\u2019re gonna see municipalities getting bailed out, to the tune of billions, trillions of dollars!

This just does not make sense! You could talk about it from the oil standpoint \u2014 I think oil is the easiest one to understand: right now oil\u2019s getting obliterated, right? It\u2019s down to $20 a barrel, the newest report out of the IEA International Energy Agency there, they\u2019re saying that they\u2019re gonna hit max storage capacity by the middle of the summer and that they expect the storage to continue to fill up between now and then, and then it\u2019s gonna really get interesting! So what happens to the price after you can\u2019t store it anymore? Well then it really starts getting punished! So if a lot of the consumption continues to be down \u2014 and I don\u2019t know how it can\u2019t be with this many people out of work, this many people not even traveling \u2014 I mean I know personally how many times I\u2019ve gotten in my car and moved around in the last month, and it\u2019s not even comparable to what I was doing before this happened! So when you look at that price and you look at the price getting punished, and then eventually people are gonna start traveling more, but in this time between now and these storage capacities hitting max capacity, these producers \u2014 now maybe not Saudi Arabia and maybe oil isn\u2019t the best example, because they\u2019re trying to take all the market share from North America right now so they\u2019re laying on the capacity. I know they just did a deal but I don\u2019t necessarily buy all that. But let\u2019s just talk about any other commodity! [47:14] Those producers that are manufacturing this are pulling that capability offline. They have to! They\u2019re gonna go out of business if they don\u2019t do it! So they\u2019re pulling their capacity offline I mean all of this is just totally similar to everything you see in Bitcoin. They\u2019re pulling their capacity offline, and when they want to stand that back up it\u2019s not like they just turn on a light switch \u2014 that\u2019s labor that they had to lay off that went and found different jobs, it\u2019s all this stuff \u2014 so when they do want to start ratcheting it back up, there\u2019s quarter to two-quarter delay before they can produce at the capacity that\u2019s gonna be demanded of them. Well guess what happens to the price of commodities when that happens? They shoot up in a major way! Well now if you\u2019re talking about the Consumer Price Index it\u2019s based off of the delta of the price that it was before. Well if you have these prices that are hitting levels that are like \u2014 not even understandable \u2014 like oil under $20 a barrel, which could get well under $10 a barrel, these numbers are crazy low! If you even have the slightest bump in any of that, guess what just happened to your CPI? Well dude it just shot to the moon, right? So that could very easily happen in six months to a year from now, you\u2019re gonna see that playing out in addition to the Bitcoin price in addition to local governments being bailed out in addition to the government stepping in and continuing to print ungodly amounts of money, people getting their $2,000 check every month, to just \u2014 I mean this is the scenario that I\u2019m playing through my mind as to how I see the world in 6 months to a year from now \u2014 that\u2019s what it\u2019s gonna look like! And I just don\u2019t know how anybody who\u2019s experiencing that and then watching Bitcoin go up by $1,000 a day sitting on the sidelines and saying, Ah! Yeah, that\u2019s normal! It\u2019s not normal \u2014 it\u2019s insane, it doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 then they\u2019re gonna start digging into, What the hell is this? Why has this thing not been able to die? Especially people in finance, when they see the market cap going over $1 Trillion, it\u2019s gonna really attract a lot of eyeballs and a lot of people saying, Maybe I need to take a little bit closer look at this thing?"}

So that\u2019s great! It worked out for them, and I\u2019m glad they\u2019re able to get that, but people got really upset because I was just like throwing the obscene numbers, if you\u2019re daily cost averaging that into Bitcoin \u2014 the kind of returns you\u2019d get would be over $4 Billion! And I would say that\u2019s a little absurd but there\u2019s deeper points to that which is like, Do you have a good contract with the insurance company such that you get payout in actual money?

Other people might see it as sort of free money and I guess like the sort of stated purpose of it is a sort of stimulus. They want you to go spend it anyway!

And I fear that that might cause some deceleration in the short term.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [58:49]: It\u2019s so hard to be able to say one way or the other.

{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: The Federal Reserve on the other hand has actually been more responsive and faster than the Congress, and I think that\u2019s probably the case as well in the previous financial crisis where TARP got voted down the first time around, and so there actually is ironically more willingness to bail out the banks than there is to bail out main street, and I just don\u2019t think that the banks themselves are going to go, Why would they go out and lend money? And the Fed has opened it up to AAA-rated companies and we\u2019re gonna go down the yield curve and find worse and worse credit to buy in their facilities. But are they gonna go Japan-style and start buying equities as well? There\u2019s been noise about that!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [1:00:07]: I don\u2019t know. But the fact that they\u2019re already buying junk debt tells me that they\u2019re probably being a champion of that idea. Which is just totally insane! As far as I\u2019m concerned, you are so far off the rails of capitalism at this point already, not even buying the equity market, but the fact that you\u2019re stepping in and basically saying, Yeah that\u2019s junk debt! Let\u2019s buy it and keep these zombies alive! Is effectively what they\u2019re saying! I mean dude it\u2019s scary! I think that\u2019s the best way I can describe it is it\u2019s scary that you\u2019re seeing that! But let\u2019s look at why they\u2019re doing this. They cannot allow interest rates to go up. That is a fact! If interest rates go up, well now all of a sudden, they can\u2019t issue the debt at the volume that they need to issue it at. So they\u2019re gonna do everything they can possibly do to keep interest rates at 0%. So that\u2019s where the calculus for them gets really difficult because now they\u2019ve gotta do UBI. They realize there\u2019s social unrest at this point with the amount of people that are out of work and that\u2019ll continue to be out of work. So now we\u2019ve gotta do UBI. But we also have to continue to do QE, because we can\u2019t allow interest rates to go up or this whole thing goes boom! Now they\u2019re in this tricky situation where they can\u2019t turn off either one of those spigots! They can only basically turn them off. So I\u2019ve had a couple Tweets and it\u2019s hilarious because I don\u2019t hear a peep out of a single solitary Wall Streeter on my account, and I have a lot of Wall Streeters that follow me. Not a freaking word about the idea that, You\u2019re gonna get inflation, but you\u2019re gonna get it all at once. And it\u2019s gonna come like a flippin\u2019 tsunami! And what it is, is it\u2019s total trust in the bond market breaking down.It\u2019s at that point where everyone says, Hold on a minute! Oh my God! This is a tsunami coming at us! Oh my God! I gotta get up on a tree or I gotta get up on a building or I\u2019m gonna die! Right? And then everyone exits those positions out of these bond markets, and it\u2019s gonna be a flippin\u2019 tsunami. And they\u2019re gonna continue to do QE and UBI and all of a sudden there\u2019s gonna be this breaking point!"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [1:02:43]: It\u2019s just interesting to see the parallels between that and the virus, right? Where in both cases there\u2019s a period of denial until the ICU is full of people on respirators and you can no longer deny reality! What is that going to look like in terms of the ICUs being full of people on respirators? From the monetary inflation perspective, how do we know that we\u2019re starting to hit that point of \u2014 there\u2019s no denial anymore?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [1:03:22]: For me personally, I think if we break the upside of the stock to flow model, you\u2019re there. I mean I don\u2019t know how else to look at it! But I think that if you see that model break, which I would argue seeing it break to the upside is probably around a $300,000 price \u2014 something like that right? If you see that happening, you see the price go beyond that and you see people running, you\u2019re probably witnessing that event."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [1:03:56]: I like this metaphor: Bitcoin is the monetary ICU. People who need the best care in the world from a monetary perspective, end up in the Bitcoin ward. And then we can think about the stock to flow second standard deviation as kind of the overflow capacity of this ICU unit! In 2021, we\u2019re at $500,000 as the upside of this second standard deviation, which today sounds like, Okay well that\u2019s just pure hopium, and Pierre\u2019s being crazy! But really I\u2019m just looking at the exponential, right? I\u2019m just like you in January saying, Hey look! This is what\u2019s going on in Wuhan right now! Why do you think it\u2019s going to be different in New York City? It\u2019s not. It\u2019s gonna be exactly the same!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [1:05:10]: The way I would like to describe these halving events is, They\u2019re attempts at basically escape velocity. So each time you go through one of these halving events, these quantitative tightening events, it\u2019s Bitcoin\u2019s attempt at trying to escape gravity and exit the orbit! And so last time we saw that, we saw the attempt, the speculators could have taken it to $100,000 and then you could have maybe gone further. But, all the market participants were not at a point where you had enough buy-in for that to occur! So what happens? Well the gravity of the two-week difficulty adjustment took hold, and it brought it back down into its orbit where it needed to remain, until it could ramp itself up and go through its immunization in order to get ready for the next attempt of its exit velocity! So right now we\u2019ve got the quantitative tightening happening \u2014 it\u2019s gonna make another run at it! It\u2019s almost like watching a high jumper: he\u2019s going there, he\u2019s gonna jump over it. If he doesn\u2019t make it he comes back and he does 1,000 reps on the legs and then cools off for a couple weeks and then makes another run at the exit velocity. So what we\u2019re watching is we\u2019re watching the next attempt! And whether it makes it or not I have no idea! I kind of suspect based on the backdrop of everything that\u2019s happening in the other markets, that you probably have a pretty high probability that it\u2019s gonna make it this time! Probably a lot higher than a lot of people wanna give it credit for! But if it doesn\u2019t, no big deal! It comes back down into that stock to flow level that you\u2019ve got all that difficulty adjustment that\u2019s gonna pull it back in there if you can\u2019t get enough market participants to join the network and bring it to total dominance. It\u2019s gonna come back, it\u2019s gonna ramp up, it\u2019s gonna get stronger, it\u2019s gonna get more security on the network, you\u2019re gonna have new miners that are gonna enter \u2014 all of those things are happening, which are just making it that much stronger! It\u2019s completely antifragile! And there\u2019s plenty of people that have said that before. So if it doesn\u2019t make it this time it\u2019ll make it next time. It\u2019s not going away! And it\u2019s just a matter when it reaches its escape velocity! I\u2019m kind of hopeful that on this next one it\u2019s gonna make it!"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [1:07:35]: And the bear case is that it\u2019s gonna oscillate around $100,000 if it doesn\u2019t make it out.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Michael Goldstein: I think the real bear case at this point is a measly $30,000 using Nick [inaudible] latest stock to flow model based on some \u2014 I don\u2019t remember. So that\u2019s the bearish number. I can only imagine people are giving a shit because it\u2019s only $30,000! But yeah at the same time using the $100,000 model, even $300,000 actually is completely within the range of the stock to flow price points. I fact I think $300,000 would be pretty equivalent to the $20,000 this past round in terms of the scale. If I remember correctly Plan B said about 3x-10x the S2F price is within bounds before you\u2019d be really breaking that model. There\u2019s a lot of room for velocity, but if you\u2019re getting it to 10x to $1 Million, I do have to wonder what brings it down!"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [1:09:05]: Well, miners! There would just be so much money going into mining at that point that that\u2019s what is the mean-reverting causal mechanism.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh: It just gets too difficult! So there\u2019s too much competition, I mean it\u2019d be like if the price of gold shoots to $7,000 you\u2019d have everyone and their kid\u2019s sister trying to mine, super competitive as the time goes on."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: I guess what I meant is if it was getting up to $1 Million, if everyone was still fine with the dollar at that point, what you\u2019re describing could happen. But if it gets to that point, what is the point in which everyone in the world looks at it and goes, Okay, well we\u2019ve gotta capitulate?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [1:09:54]: So historically when you look at the thirds in the four-year cycle \u2014 so take 365.25 times four, whatever number that is, then you\u2019re gonna divide that by a third. Those are the key inflection points in the four-year cycle \u2014 the thirds of it. So if you look at the first third of the four-year cycle, which takes you out to like the 10th November 2021, that\u2019s where you should see the price really hit its fever pitch through all the speculators and everyone stepping in. If you see the price continue to run way past that date, I would tell you things are really starting to get interesting as far as escape velocity goes! Then you take the next third. The next third you should see the bottom, whatever date that comes out to \u2014 I have not tried to quantify what that date it. But if you take another third of that next four-year cycle, that\u2019s where your bottom should be based on too much competition, the miners bringing it back down into reality, and then you\u2019re gonna see a bottom there because the difficulty adjustment\u2019s gonna assist with so much competition entering the space for hashing power. And then the next third takes you to the next halving event. Those are the dates that I pay close attention to."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:11:11]: I like that heuristic!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard: Yeah I wanted to go back to the point Michael was making about the primal importance of money historically in terms of conflict. And the amount of plundering \u2014 really should that be surprising? Because you\u2019re talking about the most liquid good in society? It makes sense that that would be the crown jewel that you go for every time."}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:11:41]: People took to the seas, and subjugated entire new continents of people to get their hands on it! Only to destroy their own economy in the process.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard: The golden calf! Now so you\u2019ll hear people say that the US dollar is backed by the might of the US military, and I think that the naive way of thinking about that is that the US military is holding a gun to people\u2019s heads, forcing them to use the US dollar. I think that the more sophisticated way of thinking about it is that the US military creates an environment where it is safe to use the US dollar, right? And they are able to repel opponents, adversaries, that are trying to undermine the US dollar and try to seize it. So to me the US military actually adds to the seizure-resistance of the US dollar, and that\u2019s why it is strategically important to have aircraft carriers around the world, securing trade routes and having a global financial system that is dollar-centered. And the way Bitcoin challenges this is not by challenging it head-on, but rather by flanking it in the sense of, Okay, we\u2019re going to do this in cyberspace. And it\u2019s interesting because the US military could attack Bitcoin in cyberspace, right? It could try to prevent nodes from getting online and essentially work with ISPs to kick people off. And it would be very challenging to route around that! We would have to have Adam Back\u2019s [inaudible 1:13:43] and Nick Szabo\u2019s short-wave radios to go pirate. But it\u2019s like, because we\u2019re operating on a different battlefield than the 21st century battlefields, we\u2019re able to dominate from a monetary perspective and now state actors are playing catch-up. And this isn\u2019t the US, even. It\u2019s like, China\u2019s trying to come up with their digital currency, but I don\u2019t think that they fully understand that the importance is in the networks, the peer to peer network, is the biggest advantage that we have as a user of Bitcoin. And I don\u2019t think Mark Cuban understands this either! Running a full node! I don\u2019t think Mark Cuban understands the game theory of running a full node, which is really far more important than the number of ticket sales you have for the Mavericks!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:14:54]: Another aspect that I always like to bring up with the military whenever people try to make the chartalist claims around money and the legitimacy of money and all that is, In order to have that military, you do have to pay them something, you know? And right now the military generally I guess by law they accept US dollars but at some point unless you plan on inciting people which requires paying some other people to take control of those defectors \u2014 maybe they\u2019ll demand another currency! Or just devalue the US dollar by putting their payment into a different currency.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [1:15:41]: I think it\u2019s just an old argument, that\u2019s been said so many times. Prior to Bitcoin it was a very strong argument, you could go with that all day long because in my opinion it was a valid argument. But now you just got a different situation so templating that into this situation I don\u2019t think is a direct correlation and it doesn\u2019t work anymore! Let\u2019s say China or the US has a major problem with this and they want to wreak havoc by shutting down Internet service providers causing issues with the satellites \u2014 all that kind of stuff. They can absolutely do that, and if they did that you would see the price in the interim absolutely suffer. Where I think that it\u2019s gonna run into an issue on the long haul is a lot of these governments right now are having issues with maintaining support of the general population. Just because of the situation we\u2019re in right now! So if they step in and they punch something in the face that was actually providing substantial returns to people, to your people that have never been able to make any type of return at all in any type of market, I think you\u2019re gonna potentially cause some social unrest, potentially cause \u2014 especially from some of these smaller nations that have been a victim of dollar dominance \u2014 which living in America a lot of Americans don\u2019t understand what that feels like or what that experience is like. But for every other country in the world they know exactly what that experience is like! And I think that\u2019s gonna potentially cause problems if you see some of those antics. So is it a risk? Absolutely. Is it a long term risk? I\u2019m not so sure. Is it a short term risk? Absolutely, if it would be implemented. So I\u2019m just trying to look at it as objectively as possible. I suspect this thing\u2019s gonna be moving out at a clip that\u2019s so fast that you have people \u2014 I mean let\u2019s face the facts: there\u2019s some people with substantial wealth in this space that can influence politicians, decision makers. I think a lot of that might already be taking place and it\u2019s only gonna get stronger in the year to come as this goes in the direction that we think it\u2019s gonna go."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [1:18:17]: If it would be implemented \u2014 let\u2019s bring it back to the virus. In November, the army intelligence services notified the White House and the national security apparatus that COVID-19 was a problem. In November six months ago! And they didn\u2019t pay attention to it because they just didn\u2019t \u2014 again that normalcy bias. And I think that you could have the Federal Reserve tell Congress, Hey uh, this is a problem! We need the US military\u2019s cyberspace capabilities to shut down Bitcoin! And I don\u2019t know that Congress would even listen to them in the sense of agreeing with their analysis, because first of all I think that the only people that would come to this conclusion is the Federal Reserve! They\u2019re the only people who employ enough Keynesians that you could develop that view!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh [1:19:27] So going back to what I was talking about earlier as far as the bond market blowing up all at once, my opinion is that this is gonna happen so quickly that there\u2019s not gonna be really too much that can be done in the time span because everyone\u2019s opinion on this is gonna be, especially on Wall Street\u2014Everything\u2019s fine! Nothing\u2019s changed! The bond market\u2019s fine! Look at the volatility in the yield, they haven\u2019t moved an inch! Because that\u2019s how they measure stability, they\u2019re looking at how much of the yield\u2019s changed? Well the yield\u2019s still pegged at 0% so there must be nothing wrong! Meanwhile if you look behind the curtain, the Fed is buying all of the selling on that fixed income at such a pace that \u2014 I mean the money\u2019s catching on fire it\u2019s coming in the door so fast as they\u2019re swapping the cash for the bonds! That market is in total chaos! But the only people that are seeing that are the few people in that room handling those transactions that are buying all that selling. So I think you\u2019re gonna have the price going up, there\u2019s gonna be a lot of people talking about it and then there\u2019s just gonna be a moment like this snap of the finger that everything\u2019s gonna be moving so quickly that you\u2019re not gonna be able to out-maneuver it because the pace is happening so fast!"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [1:20:43]: Yeah I think a concept that came out of the US air force: the OODA loop. Observe, Orient, Decide, Act. I think that markets and Bitcoin especially has an OODA loop that can just not be competed with by any bureaucracy or even by traditional markets where in that liquidation day of March 12th, this is where Bitcoin\u2019s volatility is its strength! It is able to discover price far more quickly than any other asset that is of proportional liquidity. Per unit of liquidity. And that\u2019s the 10-minute settlement period. There\u2019s no competing with that! And that\u2019s the beauty of the 24/7 blockchain global network, that no government entity can compete with. And they can\u2019t even compete with the virus.

And at the time it\u2019s very obvious what it means when a bank goes bankrupt \u2014 it\u2019s because they were doing fractional reserves and they went bust! So the state was having to get more and more draconian about it. First there was something about you had to go on a diet of bread and water until you could pay back everything. And it didn\u2019t stop so there was another like, If you do not pay back the debts within two weeks we\u2019re gonna ride around town telling everyone how evil you are and then we\u2019re gonna chop your head off! And there was still a credit crisis, meaning, even with that! So my takeaway from that was, the drive to print money when you have your finger on the printer button, whatever time you are, the human drive to hit that print button is just so strong that the literal Sword of Damocles can be hanging over your head and it won\u2019t stop you!

Now I think you\u2019ve got a completely different scenario! I\u2019m not saying that you\u2019re gonna see it hit escape velocity this time, I just think that the probability is way higher than maybe most are expecting, simply because of the backdrop!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein [1:32:06]: Yeah I can agree with that! In which case it\u2019s extremely risky to try to be timing the top on this cycle!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Preston Pysh: Oh my God, yeah! I think it\u2019d be crazy to do that!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: I had a Tweet once that\u2019s like, Only buy the Bitcoin that you can afford to HODL. You gotta keep an eye on your expenses you don\u2019t over-expose yourself!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard: Just remember: scissors are cheap! And haircuts are expensive!"}
{"prompt": "Michael Goldstein: Although, you don\u2019t really need to cut your hair! That\u2019s even less expensive, right? Just let it grow out!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard: Yeah you know that\u2019s true! I haven\u2019t gotten a haircut since January. Because I kept pushing it off until I couldn\u2019t get one even if I wanted to! This sounds like a process of de-civilization, Michael! I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re all in right now. It\u2019s going back to caveman times! So we have the Mark Cuban paradox \u2014 I also think that there\u2019s a Warren Buffett paradox! Where the focus is on owning assets that have a cash flow. And we see this in Bitcoin as well with people saying, You\u2019ve gotta invest your Bitcoin with BlockFi or whatever to earn a yield, otherwise it\u2019s not worth owning, basically is the view! Why is it that people have such an attraction to cash flow? It\u2019s kind of the investor\u2019s equivalent to the business mindset of having an obsession with revenue, right? Of, Okay, how do I get Bitcoin revenue, and then convert it into US dollars to pay for my expenses \u2014 how do I get cash flow out of Bitcoin as part of my portfolio?"}
{"prompt": "Preston Pysh [1:34:14]: This one\u2019s gonna be hard for people to change their mindset on I think for a very long time into the foreseeable future, simply because that\u2019s what your taught in school, if you\u2019ve been in the finance industry, if you\u2019ve been on Wall Street, if you own a business! You know how vital free cash flow is to the business! Everything revolves around it! The valuation comes down to the free cash flow compared to the discount rate you\u2019re using. And if I was gonna try to defend Warren Buffett, I would say: he is looking at owning good businesses that have a moat around them and what I mean by a moat is they have a competitive advantage against all of the other competitors in the space. If he owns that business and the currency changes, the business is still gonna be competitive moving forward in that aftermath or whatever that environment is afterwards. So if the currency changes from dollars to Bitcoins, well all of his businesses are now gonna start accepting Bitcoins and then he\u2019s gonna continue to still have a business that\u2019s kicking off free cash flow that has competitive advantage! So I think that\u2019s just how simple his narrative is: he does not need to hit anything out of the ballpark at all! He just needs to make sure that he doesn\u2019t lose money for all the people that have entrusted his leadership and his expertise going through this! And so I think he\u2019s just playing a very very defensive game. I think he\u2019s very skeptical because he doesn\u2019t understand the encryption and all the technology and the mining. He doesn\u2019t understand it, he sees it as being a bunch of millennials who are living on hopes and dreams trying to pump this thing. I think that\u2019s just how simple he\u2019s looking at it, and he\u2019s looking at this massive hundreds of billions of dollars enterprise \u2014 I mean he has over 70 operational businesses, I don\u2019t know how many non-operational subsidiaries that all have $10 Billion+ in market cap of how much ownership he has, so he\u2019s just looking at it from that lens. And so if you\u2019re a young Bitcoiner and you\u2019re saying, Oh Warren Buffett, he\u2019s an idiot! He doesn\u2019t know Bitcoin! Which is very easy to says, because you\u2019re looking at it from your lens, which is, I don\u2019t have a lot of money, my house isn\u2019t paid off, my car isn\u2019t paid off, I mean hell I\u2019m living in Mom and Dad\u2019s basement, and I need to break through! I need something that allows me to break through from this disaster of a life that I\u2019m living, and Bitcoin could go to $100,000 and I have 1 Bitcoin or I have 5 Bitcoins or whatever the number is, and that\u2019s gonna be my out! And that\u2019s gonna allow me to aggressively change the future and the life that I know there\u2019s a better version of our there for me! You\u2019re looking at things through two totally different lenses and I think that\u2019s where the contrast and the bashing of each other\u2014not that he bashes\u2014yeah I think you could say Buffet bashes it! Charlie Munger definitely bashes it! So I think that\u2019s the delta between vantage points.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard [1:37:48]: It\u2019s also like, what system are you operating under? In the 20th century system of inflationary money, holding cash doesn\u2019t make much sense at all! And even when Berkshire Hathaway is holding cash, they\u2019re not actually holding cash, right? They\u2019re holding cash equivalents, or better! In the sense of yield-generating assets. And really when they say they\u2019re holding cash, what they\u2019re saying is they\u2019re holding liquid T-bills or some other yield-generating asset. They\u2019re not actually holding 0% physical $100 bills."}
{"prompt": "Preston Pysh: Yeah! But he can liquidate it at a snap of a finger!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard: Right! So it\u2019s very rational to have the view that you want to be in an asset that is generation yield when there\u2019s inflation! Even \u201cmild\u201d inflation of 2%, because 2% over a decade 20% plus the compounding! And then 2% over two decades is 40% plus the compounding! You\u2019re talking about losing half your principle in a couple of decades, and in Warren Buffett\u2019s long term view, two decades is the blink of an eye, especially from an investor\u2019s perspective of wanting to retire in 40\u201350 years. You\u2019re talking about a very hefty inflation tax!"}
{"prompt": "Preston Pysh [1:39:35]: Can I please have your permission to come off the top rope right now? My God! I just can\u2019t tell you how much my blood boils when I hear people say inflation or just like give their spin on what they think inflation is! I just \u2014 I have a hard time containing myself! It\u2019s a good thing people can\u2019t hear what I mutter whenever I type responses on Twitter! So if you\u2019re using CPI as your basket of inflation, well you can make inflation whatever you want! You just gotta change what\u2019s in or out of that basket! So let\u2019s just look at what\u2019s happened over the last ten years: you had central banks that provided ungodly amounts of quantitative easing into the market. So all that is when you hear the fancy term, Quantitative Easing \u2014 you\u2019re printing a bunch of money, you\u2019re going into the fixed income bond market and you\u2019re buying those bonds. You\u2019re basically buying them at whatever price you want and supplying all that liquidity to the people that were holding those bonds, and then the government then takes on those bonds and they\u2019re sitting on them. They\u2019re pulling them off the market. The way I measure inflation is it\u2019s the frickin\u2019 simplest equation ever! It\u2019s: the expansion of monetary policy balance sheets! So if you go and you look at all these central banks\u2019 balance sheets across the globe and you add up whatever that delta is over an annual basis: Surprise! There\u2019s your inflation! It\u2019s that simple! So if you are buying these bonds and all that money that you\u2019re printing is going into the fixed income market which then subsequently goes into the stock market \u2014 if that\u2019s where all the printing\u2019s going and you\u2019re not measuring any of that \u2014 it\u2019s not in your CPI basket, well guess what? You\u2019re not gonna see any of it, period! Right? Like, how freaking simple is that idea? Just the simplest flipping idea on the face of the planet! But yet, I can\u2019t find a flippin\u2019 person that gets that! It\u2019s mind-blowing to me! I just can\u2019t understand it! Well now that you got interest rates at 0% collectively across the globe, across all durations for the most part. I can\u2019t say they\u2019re at 0% but they\u2019re getting there really fast, and at the pace we\u2019re going with all this printing, you\u2019re gonna get there across the whole duration in the US, you\u2019re already there in all these other countries. Once it gets there, now it becomes just a total farce! And that money is gonna start showing up \u2014 if they keep expanding the balance sheet of all these central banks at the pace that they\u2019re expanding it, which they have not slowed down, they\u2019ve accelerated! Guess what? It\u2019s gonna start showing up in some weird places! Because you\u2019re not gonna see it coming out of the fixed income market when the whole thing is purchased like you saw over in Japan. The rest of the world is getting there, right? Japan\u2019s just the front-runner. They got there first, going into 1990 through the 80\u2019s and everything, that place was booming! Well they got to this point, they got there, they won the printing race! Now everyone is just catching up, and it\u2019s competitive devaluation in the basement. And all of that inflation is 100% there, you\u2019re just not seeing it because you\u2019re measuring something different. It\u2019d be like, Pierre I\u2019m gonna measure how tall you are but I\u2019m gonna go into the kitchen and measure how tall an apple is and use that as a measure for how tall you are! It\u2019s just total insanity! I heard it in the Cuban interview! I heard it halfway through the flippin\u2019 interview, he goes, Well in 2008 we did all this QE \u2014 nothing happened! We didn\u2019t get any inflation! So therefore \u2014 normalcy bias \u2014 it\u2019s not gonna happen this time! And it\u2019s just like, I want to bang my head against the wall! Well you go back to 2008, 2007, going into 2008 I can\u2019t remember the exact number but late 2007 your 10-year treasury was like slightly over 5% and so was your Federal Funds Rate was over 5%. In fact the Federal Funds Rate was higher than the 10-year treasury mid to late 2007! Okay? So if that happens and you go through this situation and then they drop rates and then you do a bunch of QE, then they even buy stuff that\u2019s not at the Federal Funds Rate but they\u2019re buying stuff that further out on the duration of the bond yield curve. And they\u2019re doing all this and they\u2019re supplying all this liquidity into the system \u2014 well they can keep doing that until interest rates all get to 0% collectively all across the globe. Once it gets there, that\u2019s why this situation right now is so different than 2008. Back then they had so much interest rate to play with and they had it across the whole duration of the curve, they didn\u2019t just have the Federal Funds Rate left, they had the whole duration of the curve left! If you\u2019re gonna bid the long tail of the curve on the bond yield curve, that\u2019s a lot of flippin\u2019 money to drop that 100 basis points! Like, people don\u2019t understand how many trillions of dollars it takes to drop the 30-year bond 100 basis points! It\u2019s massive! It\u2019s ungodly! I can go in and do the calculations on some of these tools I have on my websites and figure out what that number is, but it\u2019s huge! Massive! People don\u2019t understand that!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard [1:45:12]: Yeah to me a 0% bond is basically the monetary authority saying, This is cash, right? Because cash is supposed to be 0%! And that as you go further out on the yield curve, you\u2019re creating more and more cash, and then when you get into the stock market \u2014 same thing! If you\u2019re backstopping the stock market, you\u2019re saying, Tesla stock is cash in a FDIC-insured bank \u2014 it\u2019s exactly the same because we are writing a put on it and here\u2019s what the intrinsic value of it is from a monetary perspective. But that to me is like the inevitable slippery slope of fiat. If you have the ability to print money, why not monetize every asset and turn every asset into cash, because that is the most politically popular thing to do in any scenario, is to say that, No one can lose any money, and people can only make money, and that is the official policy of this government!"}
{"prompt": "Preston Pysh [1:46:27]: It all comes back to what I said earlier in the discussion which is, There can\u2019t allow interest rates to go up, period! That is why they\u2019re doing what they\u2019re doing \u2014 they cannot afford for interest rates to go up, because guess what? The price of everything, and I mean everything on the entire planet, is based on interest rates, okay? If interest rates go up \u2014 congratulations! The price of literally everything goes down. It\u2019s just that simple. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a stock, real estate, a bond, if interest rates go up, guess what \u2014 the price you pay to own it goes down. And more importantly the reason they can\u2019t allow interest rates to go up is because then they can\u2019t issue the debt and they can\u2019t spend at the rate that they\u2019ve been spending in the past. And guess what, every one of \u2019em wanna get re-elected and they wanna push that funding and all that money into their district so they\u2019re incentivized because there\u2019s absolutely no term limits for the people that are appropriating money! So if you really want to get to the critical variables as to what\u2019s driving this incentive structure that we have, it all comes down to those key points. So yeah you\u2019re gonna see more of the same because the people that are making decisions are incentivized to make decisions in that way!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard [1:47:40]: And the only constituency that benefits from higher interest rates is new investors! All of the existing investors suffer from higher interest rates in the sense that their portfolios are decreasing in value if interest rates go up, right? And only new investors who are buying assets are benefiting from this. And just mathematically they\u2019re a much smaller constituency than the base of the existing investors, and this is the same thing with the real estate market! The only people that benefit from lower housing prices is new house buyers! And the entire stock of housing suffers from it, and everyone leveraging up against that housing, and it\u2019s the same across every asset class \u2014 you can generalize it \u2014 including 30-year treasuries."}
{"prompt": "Preston Pysh: Yeah the people that don\u2019t benefit from this model are your millennials! Because your millennials don\u2019t have the disposable income to invest! If you bought when interest rates were 5% and it got pushed down to 3%, if you had securities in whatever stock, let\u2019s just say you bought the index \u2014 it\u2019s just gonna go up in value! It just does because of how CAPM models work and how any type of discount cash flow model works. It\u2019s gonna go up in value because your discount rate went down! And if you\u2019ve got cap rates for real estate it\u2019s the same thing! So if you own the securities, you\u2019re loving it! But if you are a person who doesn\u2019t have disposable income to invest, well you\u2019re completely set over in the corner, you\u2019re not allowed to participate, you just gotta sit in the corner and color your paper!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard [1:49:34]: This is kind of off topic, but do you think that this secular trend from 1980 20% interest rates to today of 0% interest rates, is what has driven the popularity of passive index investing versus active management? Because it was so easy to make money by just buying the market?"}
{"prompt": "Preston Pysh: I think the thing that drove that is your active managers couldn\u2019t outperform the markets! I forget what the stat is \u2014 Tony Robbins had it in one of his books. But that number is as high as 97\u201398% of managers underperformed just the straight S&P 500 index! So because of that stat, because people can see the fees \u2014 and here\u2019s the part that people don\u2019t realize is that you\u2019re paying a 2% fee for actively managed money. That 2% compounded over a 30-year period of time is something like one third of your value of your portfolio! So if the portfolio would\u2019ve gone to $1 million, if it was actively managed and you had similar returns you would\u2019ve had $667,000. It\u2019s something crazy like that! It\u2019s an extreme number!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Pierre Rochard [1:50:54]: It\u2019s funny how that 2% matches the target inflation rate! Right? We\u2019ve got the same kind of dynamic, and yet in both the financial industry and in monetary economics, both get downplayed as being, Oh well that\u2019s a small number! You don\u2019t have to worry about that!"}

But obviously just for the listeners who may not know you, can you just give us a little bit of background on yourselves, where you came from, and what you were working on before all of this Bitcoin stuff?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: Yeah definitely! I can go ahead and get us started. I have been following Bitcoin since around 2013. I lurked for a few years on Bitcoin Twitter and Reddit, and then did a few smaller projects. Around 2016 I was selling hardward wallets on OpenBazaar if you remember that decentralized marketplace. That was a fun and interesting experience. I have a mechanical engineering background and I dropped out of business school actually to join up with a local company in the cryptocurrency space in Boston. So I went through the phase of getting really into Bitcoin for the ideals of decentralization, and then getting into some of the other cryptocurrency stuff and then realizing that Bitcoin is what actually is important. So I and Ken also worked for a company called Nebulus in Boston that was making a couple different products. And one of them was Obelisk. And we were making cryptocurrency mining ASICs for Siacoin and for Decred. And so from 2017\u20132019 we actually learned how to make hardware and we crowdfunded and sold and shipped over $26 million in mining hardware over a couple different generations all manufactured in the USA. Around mid-2019 we started to get really excited about the idea of building a Bitcoin hardware wallet. We actually were really inspired by your podcast series with hardware wallets. I think that was around summer of 2019. Specifically that interview with Michael Flaxman where he was saying, Every Bitcoin hardware wallet sucks! And so a lot of those ideas resonated with us and we just kept talking about it. Ultimately myself, Ken, and two of our other teammates decided to quit our jobs in the beginning of this year and start Foundation Devices with the goal of making the Open Hardware Foundation for Bitcoin and a sovereign decentralized Internet, starting with our first product which is a Bitcoin hardware wallet called Passport."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [05:53]: Gotcha. And Ken let\u2019s little hear a little bit from you also!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ken Carpenter: Yeah sure! So my background is computer science, so I\u2019m the software guy, software engineer and architect. In my career I\u2019ve done everything from embedded systems and network protocols, device drivers, embedded databases, wrote a lot of C code, a lot of C+++. Worked for companies like Electronic Arts, Arista Networks, I worked for a high frequency trading company in Manhattan, developing data analysis and visualization tools, and around 2017 I got interested in cryptocurrency so I was a bit of a late bloomer I guess. I was interested in Siacoin which was made by Nebulus, and as I got more interested in that I got involved with the community there, I actually ended up quitting my job at the high frequency trading company and joining Obelisk as an employee. While I was there I was responsible for the firmware for the miners, the web-based user interface, I wrote the customer portal front-end and back-end, and actually I was the VP of sales, too, which was interesting! Also involved with a lot of customers who were working to find colocation facilities to host their miners. Over the course of that project brought two generations of software and hardware to market as Zach was mentioning. And that brought us up to today where now I\u2019m head of software for Foundation Devices."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [07:26]: I just wanted to touch on some of this Obelisk stuff because there\u2019s been a little bit of chatter and I just think it\u2019d be a good opportunity to just address and discuss that also to give the listeners a bit of your perspective on what happened with Obelisk as well because from what I\u2019ve read, it seemed that there were some users complaining that they didn\u2019t get what they\u2019d purchased. Also I understand Zach you were not the CEO, you guys were working at this company, but could you just address some of those concerns that have been raised?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: Yeah, absolutely! We\u2019re actually really proud of the work we did at Obelisk. I joined right as the company was getting started as an early employee in the summer of 2017. And as you know, later in that Fall was the big crazy bull market. And so we launched this crowdfunding campaign for these ASIC miners without even having a photograph or an image or any really information about what the device would look like. So we said, Give us money and in 12 months from now we\u2019ll give you a miner. As you know with a lot of hardware crowdfunding projects, they can often spiral out of control. That did not happen here. We actually shipped every device that we sold, we shipped over 12,000 ASIC miners. As Ken mentioned, across two generations of chips and three generations of industrial design. And we manufactured all of that in the US. We were an average of three or four months late depending on the batch that you ordered from. We were saying we would ship by August 31st I believe it was, of 2018, and I think the first shipment started going out in October or November, but we shipped everything. And it was all within about 20\u201330% towards the target spec that we were aiming for back when we started the sale. So I think the main contention is that the altcoin mining space is a total mess. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we didn\u2019t want to be in that space anymore. Because it feels a lot like gambling. You can deliver exactly what you promise, or really close to what you promise, but what actually matters is the price of these underlying cryptocurrencies, and then also the other mining manufacturers. And so, Bitmain and INNOSILICON ended up flooding the market, especially on the Decred mining side, and none of the miners \u2014 when they received their devices in 2018 on the Decred side \u2014 made any money. So we did some cool stuff! For example, we knew that when we shipped these devices they probably weren\u2019t gonna be profitable for the Decred miners and so we offered to do buybacks so that you could at least recoup some of your money and you can choose to reinvest that elsewhere. We were trying to be very, very friendly from a customer service perspective. We were extremely transparent throughout, so ultimately we\u2019re really proud of what we did, and having shipped over 12,000 devices with only very minor delays."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [10:45]: And so perhaps you want to also tell us a little bit more about the starting of Foundation? How did that come about?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: Yeah so we just felt this unshakable itch to be founders and to be working on Bitcoin. So \u2014 I\u2019ll let Ken comment for himself personally, but for me personally when I got into Bitcoin, I was very interested in it from the decentralization and efficiency perspective. So I was all about, Let\u2019s get rid of these intermediaries, let\u2019s get rid of these trusted third parties like banks and governments, and let\u2019s just allow people to transact directly peer to peer online! Over time, though, I started to go really down the rabbit hole from podcasts like this one and Tales From the Crypt, from books like The Bitcoin Standard, and I just got so enamored with the Austrian economics perspective and about Bitcoin being the perfect money. And so between that and then being frustrated with the existing hardware wallets, then also knowing that we as a team had the potential to just design better hardware than what exists on the market today, we just felt like we had to do it! So we founded the company in mid-March and we officially started the company in April of this year. We raised a little bit of money from some small funds and angel investors, and we worked from April until now and we\u2019re at the point now where we\u2019re gonna be manufacturing in early or mid-January."}
{"prompt": "Ken Carpenter [12:30]: Yeah I would just add to that: our experience previous to that at Obelisk was that we were working like founders but we were not compensated or dealt with as founders, and so we felt like, Okay, well, we can do all of this stuff on our own and actually be the founders and be the ones making the decisions! And then be responsible for those decisions. That for me was a big part too, just having the autonomy and the fact that those of us who moved on to Foundation all had really aligned goals. Along the lines of what Zach was talking about as far as Bitcoin and design and better hardware.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [13:16]: Great. So perhaps you could just tell us a little bit about the team. As far as I understand there are four main co-founders, and you\u2019re slowly building up the team over time?"}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert: Exactly. I, like I mentioned before, have a background in mechanical engineering. I\u2019m really obsessed with product design. I\u2019ve always been obsessed with Apple as a company, and so as you can imagine as I\u2019ve embraced Bitcoin and open source, I\u2019ve fallen more and more out of love with Apple, and hoping that we can do similar great hardware designs but have it all open. And we also have Matt as one of our co-founders. He\u2019s head of our circuit engineering. He was at Intel for a few years. He has a bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s in electrical and circuit engineering. He\u2019s a little bit of a circuit prodigy. And we also have Jacob who\u2019s our head of supply chain who was at Formlabs previously. And then we have Ken of course as well here who\u2019s our head of software and has an extensive background as he mentioned in every layer of the stack from firmware up to actually doing mobile apps.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ken Carpenter: Zach always tells me to shorten my intros because I keep talking too much so that was a really abbreviated intro that I gave!"}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert: Yeah and we\u2019re hoping to grow the team. So far we\u2019ve done everything with our team of four. Between the four of us we can really hit every discipline of bringing hardware to market. A lot of the times, hardware teams struggle, especially on the supply chain and operations stuff \u2014 being able to source all these components and then manufacture them. We benefit from those experiences at Obelisk where we did so much manufacturing in the US. So we built up a lot of connections within different suppliers and manufacturers here, and so Passport is being fully assembled \u2014 circuit boards and everything \u2014 in the USA, which is also something that we\u2019re really proud of.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [15:07]: Cool. So I\u2019ve had the chance to use the demo unit also. Perhaps you could just tell the listeners \u2014 what are you trying to achieve with the Passport device itself, which is the first product?"}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert: Passport is our effort to make hardware wallets as easy and secure as possible, while also giving you a device that you can feel proud of using, that feels elegant and up to the task, and maybe even worthy of your Bitcoin. So we\u2019ve used all the hardware wallets of course over the years, and have been personally frustrated by whether it\u2019s difficulty using the devices \u2014 for example, difficulty doing things as simple as entering a PIN number \u2014 to also being concerned from a security perspective about not having an air gap. And I think Michael Flaxman probably explained all these shortcomings much better than we can over a year ago on your podcast, but we think that things like PSBTs are really important, having a true air gap is really important, allowing for really easy text entry and navigation to encourage best practices when it comes to passphrases or other things like that is really important. So we just want to make that is so easy to use that maybe we can actually pull users off of Coinbase and other centralized exchanges, and also have this really great open source security model, where not only is the firmware completely open, but the hardware designs themselves are completely open, both for auditability and also so anyone can build off of our work.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ken Carpenter [16:46]: Right, we\u2019re seeing ahead here to Bitcoin exploding! And we just don\u2019t think any of the wallets today are gonna get us to the hundreds of millions more people that are gonna be coming into Bitcoin. We just think we need to improve the user experience significantly to get those people on board."}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert: We look at the hardware wallet space today as being very similar to the MP3 player space before the iPod came out. We\u2019re not claiming that we\u2019re the iPod, but we\u2019re definitely striving to follow those similar principles in terms of design and UX. We\u2019re just looking to make a product that millions of people can use. And our biggest fear is that we\u2019re gonna see a massive amount of new users over the next few years during this bull market, and then throughout this decade, and that because it\u2019s difficult to store your own keys, we\u2019re gonna see all those users go to Coinbase or go into Grayscale or something like that. And it\u2019s already quite scary where I think it\u2019s maybe over 1% of the Bitcoin supply is with Coinbase custody right now, and that\u2019s just not an environment that we want, and so we just wanna be able to provide users with actual sovereignty and ownership over their keys. But without them having to deal with a lot of the complexities and all the quirks of using today\u2019s generation of hardware wallets.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [18:26]: Cool. And so one interesting aspect here and when you\u2019re doing a hardware wallet, some hardware wallet manufacturers in this space have chosen to try to provide the full stack, if you will. Like for example Ledger Live or Trezor\u2019s web wallet. Whereas other hardware wallet manufacturers have opted more to just say, No we\u2019re just making the hardware! You go and use the wallet software. So tell us a little bit about your approach on that part?"}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert: Yeah so our approach is definitely the second approach, and very much inspired by Coldcard\u2019s approach. We think that at its essence, hardware is a delivery mechanism for great software. And we think that the software developers that are working on all these different projects, whether that\u2019s Specter or Casa or whether it\u2019s the team at Unchained Capital or whether it\u2019s these newer multisig wallets like Lily or Nunchuk just came out a few weeks ago \u2014 there\u2019s so much innovation on the software side. Our goal as a hardware manufacturer is to give all the software developers access to just a great device that they can really easily integrate with their applications, and then provide their users with more security. What that does is it allows for faster innovation on the software side. For example, Ledger\u2019s Live app only just added full node integration like a week ago, but you\u2019ve seen so many other wallets that have full node integration over the last few years, because when you\u2019re more agile on the software side you can move faster. So that I think is key and important to us. And then there\u2019s also the privacy concerns: if you start to trap users into this ecosystem where you use your corresponding desktop app to also be a place where they can buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies and then swap between them and all that kind of stuff, you start to create a walled garden, and you also start to collect a lot of data about these users. You know xPubs, you know IP addresses, you know all this information. We don\u2019t actually want any of this information! And so we try to carry that practice through even in our website and e-commerce store and we self-host everything on Wordpress or Woocommerce, we self-host our own analytics. We don\u2019t want to be giving data to anyone, and we want to be collecting the most minimal data as possible about our customers because there\u2019s serious privacy concerns when you\u2019re building this kind of stuff.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [21:06]: Of course. I broadly agree with you. Perhaps just to \u2014 it might be fair to give a bit of a context there for some of the OG hardware manufacturers like Trezor and Ledger. They were started in a different era, you know? Before some of the software that we have today was available. Maybe part of it is like, they had to do things a certain way because they were around at a time when the tooling just wasn\u2019t there. But now we do have better tooling and we have things like Specter desktop and we have things like Blue wallet which we might chat a little bit about. Certainly I think the approach of each party trying to specialize harder into their area and say, Okay I\u2019m a hardware manufacturer and I\u2019m just gonna focus on making the best possible hardware wallet I can! I think that makes a lot of sense to me! Perhaps the challenge then is, How do you make it all interoperable? I guess PSBT is part of the answer here. But how do you figure out or think about working with the different wallets that are available out there?"}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert [22:08]: Yeah so I think PSBT is definitely key here, and luckily there\u2019s been a lot of great work that\u2019s been done. When we actually started the company \u2014 you know, Passport uses QR codes as the primary means of communication to establish a really secure air-gap \u2014 we did not know what standard we would be using for QR codes. Luckily, Blockchain Commons, which is a non-profit group in this space, was working on that. So they basically developed this, it\u2019s called [Uniform Resources specification (URs)] and that\u2019s actually what we use to have interoperability with the QR codes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ken Carpenter [22:50]: So they\u2019re also working on other standards to help hopefully make it easier for wallets to interoperate both between the software and the hardware wallets. So we\u2019re part of the working groups there and keeping up with what they\u2019re working on and providing our input on what we think the standard should be."}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert: The goal is basically that 1) we have a universal standard for communicating data over multiple QR codes with an air gap, and it looks like with this URs standard from Blockchain Commons we\u2019ve achieved that. And that\u2019s currently used by all of the different wallets that are using URs whether that\u2019s Cobo, Specter, Blue wallet \u2014 some of them are using an earlier beta version which is UR 1.0, but they should all be upgrading to UR 2.0 over the next several months, which is the final version released by Blockchain Commons. And then 2) Blockchain Commons is also doing some other cool stuff like standardizing the export, so that when you go ahead and you export your xPubs, you are able to export all of your xPubs and your various derivation paths in a single set of QR codes. Because right now it can be complicated \u2014 each software wallet requires an export from the hardware wallet in different formats. So with Passport we actually have a cool menu to make it really easy to pair up Passport with all of the different software wallets. We\u2019re doing a lot of manual work on the back end to figure out, Okay, what format did they need this data in? So hopefully over the next several months we\u2019ll be able to converge on the format for that as well, and then it gets really easy because you get to pretty instantly pair your hardware wallet with your software wallet, and then you get to pass data over multiple QR codes with the same protocol, and then you can have an explosion of air gapped singlesig and multisig hardware wallet transactions communicating with software wallets on desktop and on mobile!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [24:50]: Yeah it\u2019s certainly a great vision! Now is probably a good time to talk through my experience of trialing the unit out. So I\u2019ve got a test unit as I mentioned earlier. I put in the batteries, spawn it up, at the start there was the, Verify on the website that this is the legitimate device, and then I spun up a small seed just with $5 on it as you guys had and basically imported that into Blue wallet using the QR codes. And so when you do that \u2014 because the entire device is air gapped, right ?\u2014 so everything is QR or SD card, basically. So I did it with a QR code and from my perspective I thought it was an interesting experience. Certainly very different to the typical, Plug in a USB or Do the SD card. And yeah Blue wallet picked it up very quickly. For me it was just about making sure you had the right lighting so the cameras could talk to each other. But once you get through that, the scanning worked pretty simply! So I thought that was pretty cool. Can you tell us a little bit about your thoughts there around how it\u2019s gonna work with multisig?"}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert [26:14]: Yeah. It works very similar for multisig, to singlesig. I think the biggest difference with multisig is that 1) you typically have more data so that means more QR codes. Luckily as you probably saw from Blue wallet for Passport, they can pass QR codes back and forth pretty quickly. So you could pass \u2014 I believe for the tests you were doing it\u2019s typically for singlesig 2\u20134 QR codes \u2014 and for multisig it could be a bunch more. But even holding up your phone to your hardware wallet for 5\u201310 seconds is going to be much faster than passing a micro SD back and forth or plugging into USB. And so we think the QR codes make multisig really great. The other big thing about multisig is being able to import that quorum of your different public keys and derivation paths so that you can actually verify addresses on device. That\u2019s also something great that QR codes work for. It\u2019s really easy to pass that information to the device in an air gapped way, using just a few QR codes that are encoded with this URs 2.0 protocol.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ken Carpenter [27:31]: We\u2019d like to work with the wallets to figure out what the right format is there and just make it super simple to import that quorum information."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera: Yeah and if you go back a year, one of the challenges that Michael Flaxman and others were talking about was this idea of, How do you make sure you actually have access to the change? And that you\u2019re not signing to some quorum that doesn\u2019t include only your three devices. Whereas as I understand then, once you register the other devices in the quorum, that\u2019s now starting to give you additional protections against this kind of thing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert [28:09]: Exactly! One thing that we haven\u2019t looked at closely yet because we\u2019ve been pretty heads down, but I did listen to your podcast with Stepan [Snigirev] from a couple weeks ago, and I believe Specter, while it\u2019s experimenting with the idea of, When you display or you pass an address, you\u2019re also passing the corresponding derivation path for that address, and that makes it extremely easy to verify on the hardware wallet that the address belongs to your device. Otherwise what you end up having to do is you have to brute force or pre-derive a lot of different potential addresses on the hardware wallet in order to compare. But if you have the derivation path, you can just immediately go and check if the addresses match. Hopefully throughout 2021 we\u2019ll see some standards form on that side to make it just brain-dead simple to instantly verify that a singlesig or multisig address belongs to the hardware wallet. And I do think that the various multisig services \u2014 I hope all of them add this in 2021! Not all of them have the ability to export the multisig quorum information to a hardware wallet. I know Specter does, I believe Unchained Capital does now, I think they started that with Trezor, I think it\u2019s also supported by Coldcard. I don\u2019t believe that Casa does at this time, I don\u2019t think that Blue wallet does either right now. So I think we\u2019ll see a lot of progress on that in 2021 and hopefully by the end of next year we\u2019ll just have really really easy standards to just verify an address on the hardware wallet and get people used to that as part of the flow. Because I think that\u2019s something that people aren\u2019t really used to right now. Oftentimes you just quickly create a receiving address and then send to that address. I think being able to quickly scan a QR code of that address from your own hardware wallet and get the thumbs up that the address belongs to you is going to be a killer feature!"}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [32:20]: It\u2019s interesting to see the way that security in this space is quickly ramping up. Perhaps in the past some of these things were available only to professional level or highly technical Bitcoin wizards! Whereas now some of these things are coming down the technical competence level requirements. It\u2019s making some of these higher security aspects available to the everyman or at least it\u2019s going to start out with the more tech-savvy people. Some of the points that some of the listeners might be thinking at this point is good to address\u2014it\u2019s common that in this space, people want something to be battle tested before they trust it with any serious amounts of funds. How are you thinking about that with, Well, it\u2019s a first edition of a hardware wallet, listeners might be unclear that, Okay, it\u2019s the first edition. Who knows if the first edition will really work? Maybe there will be hardware security hacks on it and things like that? How are you planning to get through that?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert [33:23]: I think that\u2019s definitely very valid! There\u2019s a couple different things there. One is that users should definitely slowly adopt Passport, right? We\u2019re definitely not recommending that you go buy a Passport and then you throw all of your sats onto it in a singlesig setup. So I think multisig helps a lot there. There\u2019s definitely a need for another air gapped multisig-friendly hardware wallet. In Michael Flaxman\u2019s latest guide, I\u2019m pretty sure that in his 2-of-3 multisig setup \u2014 for the third key \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy with any of the hardware wallets and so he recommended creating a seed offline and storing that offline on paper or on metal. And so we hope that we can be that third option! That way if there is a bug or if there is a vulnerability, it won\u2019t impact you, right? It won\u2019t impact loss of funds. There\u2019s a couple of other things that we\u2019re we\u2019re doing. One is, the hardware architecture we\u2019re using is not like invented by us \u2014 it\u2019s the same architecture that Coldcard and Bitbox 02 use \u2014 which is when you have the standard microprocessor and then a secure element chip. In this case we\u2019re using the same secure element chip as both Coldcard and Bitbox 02. From that perspective it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve invented some new architecture. The open source component also really helps because all of the hardware and all of the firmware is completely open. If we were closed source then that would be a really really hard sell. I\u2019m not sure if Ken wants to add anything about the firmware, but we are having the Wallet.fail guys do our security audit."}
{"prompt": "Ken Carpenter [35:17]: Yeah that was what I was gonna mention. We\u2019re gonna make sure that the code is fully audited before we ship it to any customers. We take it pretty seriously though. We know it\u2019s the first time, but we want to store our Bitcoin on this thing too! We\u2019re gonna make sure that we don\u2019t lose our money, and we\u2019ll sure that you don\u2019t lose your money.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: While we basically designed Passport \u2014 from a hardware perspective \u2014 from the ground up, and we started off with a fresh micro-Python project and did all of our hardware bring-up for all the various components and did a lot of the low-level firmware stuff, we have ported over a lot of Coldcard\u2019s open source firmware as well, including the code that they use to create the Bitcoin transactions, and we looked at a lot of the code that we used for communicating with a secure element, and some of the security features too. So one of the great things about open source \u2014 especially when you\u2019re dealing with GPL 3 code, which is very copyleft code where you open source your code and you only let other people use it if they\u2019re going to open source their work in return \u2014 so one of the benefits of that is we have not started completely from scratch even though we\u2019ve made a lot of changes, and that\u2019s why it\u2019s going to be really important to have experts look at what we\u2019ve done and test it out. We have not just gone in, started completely from scratch and just messed around and put together some V1 of firmware that is completely untested! We\u2019ve tried to use some building blocks and then architecture from existing devices so that we\u2019re not just flying blind here. Hopefully that will help us a lot and help us avoid rookie mistakes that you would expect from a new hardware wallet manufacturer."}
{"prompt": "Ken Carpenter [37:03]: Yeah. So we tried to use the things that were solid, more or less unchanged, and then anywhere that we thought we wanted to do something differently, we spent quite a bit of time thinking about what changes we were making and the security model around those. I think we\u2019re gonna be good \u2014 we\u2019ll see what the audit has to say! And we\u2019re planning to publish the result of that audit as well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: Excellent! I think another point that listeners might be thinking is: it also takes monitoring what\u2019s going on in the Bitcoin space. As a quick example, as I understand there was that SegWit vulnerability earlier in the year. Technically this had actually been disclosed \u2014 I believe it was Gregory Sanders (@theinstagibbs) who had disclosed it maybe a couple years ago on the Bitcoin mailing list \u2014 actually what happened earlier this year was Saleem Rasheed had gone and done an exploit based on that, and so then that triggered off a round of Trezor updating their firmware and so on. The question I\u2019m getting to is \u2014 it essentially takes a lot of: following the space and knowing what\u2019s going on, probably some familiarity with Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Core code, so how are you looking at that and trying to stay on top there?"}
{"prompt": "Ken Carpenter [38:19]: Zach has been really great about following the news side of things and then pointing me to things. Because I\u2019ve been really heads down getting the code working. One of the things I\u2019ll be doing in the coming few weeks is going back over a lot of those issues that have been found over the time since we first started working on it, and integrating some of the patches and addressing some of the vulnerabilities. But I\u2019ve also started looking at some of the Bitcoin Core, just to get a cursory level of familiarity with the code before I can start diving in. It\u2019s definitely on our list to get more familiar with that code, and also we\u2019re looking to hire more people in the future to help augment that knowledge.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: Exactly. And then I think by sharing some common code with Coldcard helps us a lot, and then just looking at all the different updates from Ledger, Trezor, Bitbox, and from Coldcard on every release cycle has allowed us to get really comfortable with everything. We started the software project in April, and so we\u2019re completely up to date with all the vulnerabilities from before April, and then over the next several weeks before we ship \u2014 as Ken mentioned \u2014 we\u2019re going to be making sure that we address all the stuff that\u2019s happened since April. That Segwit vulnerability was definitely interesting, where you can get someone to sign multiple transactions and then piece together basically a fraudulent transaction and steal their coins. Coldcard fixed that in an interesting way by storing a hash of the transaction on the Coldcard. I know that also that vulnerability created a lot of controversy. I believe that was the same fix that caused Trezor to close down a lot of derivation paths which broke compatibility with various software wallets. So we\u2019re really cognizant of \u2014 as we make sure that we\u2019re caught up with everything in the space and keeping track of all the vulnerabilities, we wanna make sure that we fix things in a way that makes the software wallet developers happy as opposed to breaking any functionality, which was pretty contentious earlier this year. I know that some things like BTCPay was affected, Casa was affected, a bunch of stuff was affected with how that specific Segwit vulnerability was fixed."}
{"prompt": "Stephen Livera [40:54]: Also I wanted to chat about seed generation and some of the different options available there. Can you tell us a little bit about the approach with seed generation and getting sufficient entropy and sufficient randomness there?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: Yeah definitely! I\u2019ll probably give just a higher level view of how we think about seeds and then Ken can take us through some of the nitty gritty, because we do something different than all the other hardware wallets with our main source of entropy. The way we think about seeds though \u2014 we kind of share Casa\u2019s perspective on this, where we think that for normal people, seeds are really challenging to deal with. Our ideal scenario is that we never show the seed to the user. And that\u2019s a different approach than what I think all the other hardware wallets take. The reason for that is because, as Bitcoin scales to millions and hundreds of millions of people, I think a majority of people still don\u2019t really know what the seed phrase represents. If you look at the recent Ledger and now Trezor phishing scams going on right now \u2014 and I\u2019ve actually clicked through these websites to test them out for fun \u2014 they typically revolve around tricking a user into entering their seed in a web browser. I think that that just doesn\u2019t work in the long term for a normal person to be expected to write down and manage these seeds. So I think that multisig is really really important there. And one thing we\u2019re doing as well \u2014 that you did not see in your demo because we haven\u2019t finished this feature yet \u2014 but it\u2019s the same way that Coldcard provides an option to do Micro SD backups. We actually include two industrial grade Micro SD cards with every Passport purchase. And one of them is for users to, if they want, backup their device to the Micro SD card, and that\u2019s encrypted and they can write down a few BIP39 words off the word list in order to serve as the password to that SD card \u2014 but then they never actually see the seed. They never have to write down the seed. In order to get the seed out, you have to have both the Micro SD card and the password. And I think that\u2019s a much better solution for the average user than writing the seed down. In terms of entropy, we have a few different sources of entropy in the device. We do have the embedded true random number generator in the secure element. We have the random number generator in the microprocessor. We also have an ambient light sensor, but we have something really really cool called an avalanche noise source"}
{"prompt": "Ken Carpenter [43:30]: Yeah what we did there is\u2014following some work by Bunny\u2014 it\u2019s basically a circuit which is a combination of off the shelf components like resistors and capacitors and whatnot, and the combination of these components actually generates random noise. And we sample the noise and then use that sampled noise through a whitening algorithm and come up with random numbers. And we\u2019ve done some work running it through random number analysis. We\u2019re still doing some more work there but it\u2019s looking really really good as a random source on its own. And then what we\u2019re gonna do is probably combine that with the RNG on the MCU and the SC and maybe the ambient light sensor to get a bunch of different sources and combine them together.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert [44:22]: And one of our key philosophies as a company is to minimize or eliminate what we refer to \u2014 and what Bunny, who\u2019s a famous hardware hacker who\u2019s doing the B-Trusted and Precursor projects right now \u2014 what he refers to as blackbox silicon. Meaning that, in all of these electronic devices on the market, you have a ton of chips that are basically executing blackbox firmware. So the chip itself is a blackbox because we can\u2019t, for example, go to ST Microelectronics \u2014 who makes our microprocessor \u2014 we can\u2019t go them and say, Hey, can you give us your chip design so we can audit it? That\u2019s a complete blackbox. Likewise, we can\u2019t go to Microchip \u2014 who makes the secure element \u2014 and say, Hey can you give us the design of the block on your chip that has the true random number generator? And so what\u2019s crazy in the electronics world is that pretty much every key or advanced component has an embedded chip running unknown firmware! That\u2019s also true of most LCD screens and capacitive touch panels. So if you have a touchscreen, for example, on a hardware wallet, it probably has two chips that are running unknown firmware. And so the great thing about using this avalanche noise source is that we\u2019re able to create entropy without trusting any blackbox silicon. One of our design goals over the next, probably few generations of Passport devices, is to further and further reduce the use of blackbox silicon to the point where every single chip in the device is open or we know exactly what kind of code is running on that. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re striving for from the philosophical perspective."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [46:08]: Admirable goal! In terms of that, I also wanted to ask about the firmware and how firmware updates would be done. How would they be verified and put into the new device. Can you talk us through that process?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Ken Carpenter: Sure. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re only allowing firmware that\u2019s signed by Foundation, first of all \u2014 with a caveat that I\u2019ll mention later. We\u2019re doing a scheme where we have two signatures that are required for each firmware update. Let\u2019s say we have five keys that are available: any two of those could sign a firmware update. Those would be held in different locations, so it gives a bit of friction to creating a firmware update for us, which is something we want. For example, I couldn\u2019t go rogue and publish a firmware update on my own \u2014 it would take at least two of us to go rogue. And so the idea there is to provide that friction. And then on the bootloader, the bootloader is the one that is in control of deciding when firmware can be installed or not. It will validate the signatures on the firmware, and we have the blue and the green light on the device, and it will only turn the light blue when the firmware has been validated and confirmed that it was signed by Foundation Devices. That\u2019s the first thing. We are looking at adding the ability for a customer to add their own signing key and keeping that key in the secure element. That would be a way for really advanced users to build their own code and load that onto the device. So if we were to look at how that works: the user is gonna get their key onto the device and load their firmware through the SD card, and the bootloader will pause on every boot if there\u2019s non-Foundation firmware on there, just so that no user would be fooled in thinking that, Hey I\u2019m running legitimate Foundation firmware here. There\u2019s always gonna be an indication that it was firmware that was loaded by a third party. We\u2019re also looking at a hardcore unit which would come completely unprogrammed. It would be probably a different SKU with a little bit different looking hardware, maybe different colors to the device and to the printed circuit board. But that would come without a loaded bootloader on it, even. And so you could basically hook up your own JTAG programming device and flash your own bootloader, flash your own firmware, and then decide to lock it down at any time if you wanted to do so. Maybe they\u2019ll be like 10 or 20 people in the world that want that, but we want to be able to support those people if they want to do that kind of level of validation and verification on their own."}
{"prompt": "Zach Herbert [48:54]: Yeah and one thing that\u2019s important to note is that, even if you\u2019re using a hardware wallet that lets you build your own firmware from source and install it onto the device, there\u2019s already a bootloader on the device that cannot be changed. It\u2019s code that\u2019s loaded in at the factory, and once it\u2019s there it\u2019s permanently there on the device and it cannot be updated with the firmware update. And so our design philosophy with the bootloader is to make it as minimal as possible so that it barely does anything except very basic functionality like figuring out what firmware updates to allow. And then as Ken mentioned, there\u2019s definitely some tiny percent of users that just want to load up their own bootloader and so, it\u2019s not too complicated for us to give that to users because it just means basically diverting a device at the factory that we would have programmed and sealed \u2014 we\u2019re just sending that off to a very advanced technical user, maybe with a little kit where they can hook it up to their computer and they can build everything from source themselves. So while we\u2019ve made some key design decisions \u2014 we\u2019re restricting it only to allow firmware signed by Foundation Devices, we are still offering some of these power user features because we think, from a sovereignty perspective, that it\u2019s really really important for the people that want to be able to build their stuff from source\u2014they should be able to build that stuff from source \u2014 and we as a company should never stop them from doing that. Because then it\u2019s a very slippery slope to be an Apple-like walled garden.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [50:34]: Gotcha. I also thought it would be good to talk a little bit about in terms of attack surface of the device. The main two methods that I\u2019ve seen from using the device, you see the QR code and the SD card. So can you talk to us a little bit about why you chose those methods and not having USB?"}
{"prompt": "Ken Carpenter: Yeah. So we know that when you plug something into a computer, you\u2019re potentially connecting it to the Internet. If there is any kind of malware installed on that computer, it would have access, potentially, to data over the USB. And we just wanted to close that down completely as a potential attack vector. If you\u2019ve got an air gapped wallet that also has a USB connector, there\u2019s just the ability for you to get lazy: you don\u2019t want to do the air gapped way today, so you plug it in, and then you get pwned. With Passport, that\u2019s just not even an option. What we want to do as a company is provide people with options that basically do the right thing and encourage them to do the right thing whenever possible \u2014 like, the secure thing. This is a way, we think, that achieves that, where the only way you can interact with the device is through Micro SD card and through QR codes. So we\u2019re just cutting off entire vectors for attack, and mistakes.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert [52:00]: And ideally when we first set out to do this, being kind of silly, we didn\u2019t want to even put a Micro SD card slot on the device at all. Because a Micro SD card is almost like a mini computer! You could theoretically have a compromised Micro SD that has some tiny little chip or circuit on it or something that monitors or modifies the data that\u2019s being passed. The unfortunate truth is that, as of right now, 1) we\u2019re using micro-Python and so our firmware updates are by nature going to be too large for QR codes. You know, we would love to be able to do a firmware update via QR codes. It seems kind of silly if you\u2019re talking about hundreds of QR codes, but if you\u2019re making some minimal changes to certain lines of code and you\u2019re able to just pass the delta, it could be possible on a future unit, especially if we try to move to something like color QR codes or something like that in the future that can transmit a lot more data. That\u2019s something that we\u2019re keeping our eyes on. Just QR codes themselves are fantastic in terms of the auditability! You can always scan the QR codes and really quickly \u2014 either on mobile or on desktop \u2014 you can verify the output of that. So it\u2019s much much harder to pass something malicious through QR codes. And just to add on to what Ken was saying about USB and maybe something about Bluetooth. There\u2019s so many Bluetooth vulnerabilities all the time. We really don\u2019t think a hardware wallet should have Bluetooth. You could just Google \u201cBluetooth vulnerabilities\u201d I think there are like 3 this year that are pretty bad. And then with USB you can do a lot of tricky things with USB. And even basic dumb attacks that you wouldn\u2019t even expect! Like Ledger had a vulnerability for example where you can modify the normal MCU on the Ledger \u2014 which is like the non-security chip on the device \u2014 and it could act as a keyboard! And so your first instinct might be like, Okay, that\u2019s a weird attack. What\u2019s the big deal there? But if you combine those avenues of attacks with the types of phishing scams that we\u2019re seeing today, if you all of a sudden have the ability to open a web browser and take the user to a website, maybe that website is actually malicious and it\u2019s asking for your seed and it tricks some large number of users. So we really don\u2019t think that USB or Bluetooth belong in a hardware wallet. We also don\u2019t think that SD cards do either but we\u2019re at a point where I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to remove that. As Ken was mentioning, our goal is to always encourage the best user behavior and not give users any reason to trade off security for convenience which is what technology like USB and Bluetooth does."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [55:06]: Turning now to the hardware wallet ecosystem and the security ecosystem. As you\u2019ve mentioned, you\u2019re aiming to be an open software, open source, open hardware approach where possible. How are you thinking about contribution into the ecosystem. Are there going to be code contributions or do you have any other considerations in mind there?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: Yeah absolutely. One thing is we\u2019ve already made all of our hardware designs open source under CERN\u2019s open hardware license. CERN being the research organization, the one that makes the Large Hadron Collider and other projects. It\u2019s a really great license. It\u2019s specifically designed for hardware. We\u2019re using the strong variant of their license which is very similar to GPL. It\u2019s a viral copyleft hardware license so anyone is welcome to use our hardware designs as long as they open source their work as well, and preserve the copyright attribution. What\u2019s great about that is that if you wanna come and use some of our hardware designs, if you want to, for example, look at our implementation of the avalanche noise source \u2014 which we actually implemented from Bunny\u2019s OHL open source designs from B-Trusted \u2014 anyone is welcome to do that and use that in their projects. Likewise we\u2019ve also open sourced the first alpha version of our firmware as GPL V3 which is another viral copyleft open source license for software. So anyone is welcome to use that work. We have contributed to the Blockchain Commons URs standard. Ken ported over the URs libraries to Python and Micro-Python, and so we published that code is completely open course. Ken is that under BSD?"}
{"prompt": "Ken Carpenter: Yes I think so. The 1.0 version I haven\u2019t published yet but that\u2019ll be up this week. The 2.0 is already up though.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: So we\u2019ve already done that. We\u2019ve started to contribute a little bit financially to some of these open projects as well. So we\u2019re a very small monthly contributor to Blockchain Commons. And then if there\u2019s things we can do to make contributions back to other projects or even other hardware wallets like Coldcard, we\u2019re totally open and interested in doing so. However, each hardware wallet is designed differently so sometimes it can be really hard to take code from one and move it to the other, especially when you have different hardware in the device \u2014 different components. Sometimes instead of just doing a quick pull request it looks more like porting work from project to project \u2014 but we\u2019re totally open to that as well. We\u2019ve also used other work and we\u2019ve been really careful to give attribution to the different open source libraries. If you go into our repo on GitHub for Passport firmware, and you can just get there from foundationdevices.com/passport-firmware, we give credit to Coldcard, we also use Trezor\u2019s crypto and modcryptocurrency libraries so they have proper credit and attribution in there, we use two different QR code libraries and we have a pull request pending with one of them, we\u2019ve mentioned the Blockchain Commons stuff. So we\u2019re trying to be really careful and really good about giving attribution to all the different open source work that we\u2019ve built upon."}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera [58:46]: Gotcha. Yeah I mean, this is one of those spaces where there\u2019s always wars going on between different producers and makers of things. So I don\u2019t want to get into the drama of that, but hopefully at least there can be some level of multisig Kumbaya going on and people will be just like, Hey we\u2019re all gonna do well out of this! With a lot of people coming in, and if we all play nicely together then maybe that is a reasonable future that we can hope for. One other area to discuss is pricing of the device. On the website the preorder is listed at $299 USD. Can you tell us a little bit about why this price point? And for what kinds of people do you think this makes sense? Obviously a straight new hodler who only has $30 it\u2019s not worth it for them. Who\u2019s the kind of person it makes sense for?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: This makes sense for anyone who holds at least a few thousand dollars of Bitcoin or more. This definitely does not make sense if you hold $1000 of Bitcoin. If you\u2019re gonna do that and hold a smaller amount of Bitcoin you\u2019re probably gonna just have it on Cashapp or River or one of these other services. Or using something like Blue wallet on your phone. We think that from a price point perspective, it\u2019s not like we decided to just start at this price point and then that\u2019s it \u2014 we worked at it from a first principles perspective. It\u2019s more expensive to make a really high quality hardware design that uses a larger screen that\u2019s more trustable. The screen actually is auditable, it has a no-embedded processor running a known firmware, no blackbox silicon, so the screen is more expensive, we have a really high quality keypad experience \u2014 that\u2019s more expensive. We use high quality plastics, the main structure of the device is casted in zinc alloy and plated in real copper. We have a processor that I think is the fastest processor by a good margin in any hardware wallet. It\u2019s running at 480 MHz at its fastest, compared to Trezor\u2019s Model T which is 120 or Coldcard which is 80 MHz. It\u2019s significantly faster, that\u2019s both to run the camera and also have faster processing of PSBT transactions. We\u2019re also assembling the device in the USA and we\u2019re physically on the floor at our manufacturer. And so when you add all that stuff up it does make for a more expensive product. Any hardware wallet with a QR code that is open source, that is running parts from reputable companies like STM or Microchip or Omnivision for the camera, Sharp for the screen, it\u2019s going to be more expensive than your USB wallet with a small screen. And I think that\u2019s okay! Because, especially if Bitcoin finds itself in a really positive bull market scenario, I think that paying a little bit more money for a much better user experience, and a really great air gap. I think it\u2019s a no-brainer purchase!"}
{"prompt": "Stephan Livera: Excellent. I think that\u2019s all we got time for for this one. It\u2019s a good time to wrap up. Zach and Ken where can we find you online?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Zach Herbert: We\u2019re at https://foundationdevices.com/. We currently are accepting preorders for Passport. The official estimated ship date is March 31st, but we will be manufacturing in mid-January. And so hoping to ship the devices as soon as possible in later January or early February. We do a lot of blogging and we talk more about open hardware on our blog and on our site. We have a weekly newsletter as well. Definitely hop on the site, check us out, give us a follow on Twitter! And let us know if you have any feedback, you can always e-mail us at hello@foundationdevices.com."}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Always fun chatting with you, Stephan!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: So Saife, I had the pleasure of looking at some of your new work. I pre-ordered it. But firstly, just tell us a little bit about it. What is The Fiat Standard? What are you trying to achieve here?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: The Fiat Standard was born out of the questions that were left unanswered in The Bitcoin Standard. So The Bitcoin Standard explained how Bitcoin is the hardest money ever invented in terms of its salability across time, it beats anything else that we\u2019ve ever had because it has the highest stock to flow ratio, and it gave plenty of examples of how this generally means that this leads to Number go Up technology, which unfortunately I hadn\u2019t had the term when I wrote the book! It would have a lot if I could have just explained NgU technology! Because of the increase in the value of the harder money, eventually it ends up dominating the other monies and driving them out of the market. So given that that is the implication of the Bitcoin standard, it would be interesting to imagine how such a process could unfold? How can the current monetary system be overthrown. And so to do that, this book begins by studying the fiat monetary system from first principles really. In a similar way to how I studied and explained The Bitcoin Standard in 2017, published in 2018. I looked at the thing, and I tried to make sense of the economic properties of it and tried to explain them with reference to debates in academic economics. And so I thought Bitcoin is a simpler, neater system, it\u2019s a more advanced system, it\u2019s a system that performs the functions of money and settlement in a far neater, simplified way that allows us to really discern the essential elements of these functions. And then we can apply that lens looking at fiat. And try and understand how fiat functions. And as I started to think in these terms, I started to realize really, this is quite a useful way of understanding how fiat functions. In a similar way, you and I went through a period where we were alt-curious and we looked into altcoins and read some of their stupid white papers, and when you go through this exercise of looking at the entire monetary system and trying to understand where it goes \u2014 where\u2019s the mining happening? How are the rewards distributed? How are the transaction fees paid? And so on. You start to form a picture of the essentials of how this thing works. And so, applying that framework to fiat would be a useful of beginning to assess how fiat works, and then using that as a springboard to explain what happens as Bitcoin continues to grow and fiat continues to do what it has been doing forever.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [06:34]: So we\u2019re trying to look back at the fiat system and understand how we got into the position that we are in today. Because I\u2019m sure in many cases, people who are transacting with gold directly never intended for it to become so captured, but \u2014 how do we end up in this kind of situation?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: I think looking at fiat in terms of trying to understand the problem it solves and trying to understand how it behaves in the way that it behaves \u2014 I think in the same way that with Bitcoin, I thought that salability across time was the most interesting aspect and the most fruitful avenue to explore to understand how this thing works. I think with fiat, really, the killer app behind it is salability across space. The ability of fiat money, essentially, to settle trade across space at a much faster rate than all the alternatives that existed at that time, because all the alternatives effectively were based on physical money. Actual metals that you had to lug around and move around and put on boats, and sometimes the boats would sink while crossing the Atlantic or the Mediterranean or whatever. By substituting the credit of government \u2014 which is what fiat money does. Effectively, what fiat money does is that instead of having gold as the native token of the payment system that is international, you end up having the credit of the sovereign serving as the token. And so the token supply is essentially the supply of whoever can draw credit on the sovereign. Whoever can issue credit backed by the sovereign, essentially. So anybody who creates credit gets to essentially create new fiat tokens. And when you think about it this way it starts to make a lot of sense!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [08:37]: Yeah, for sure. And I think that really aligns well with the way Carl Menger explains the origins of money. He\u2019s talking about salability through time and space, and so really what is happening is some of this capture of the system happened because people wanted something salable through space, and more easily. But then what happens is people end up using custodians, they end up using these third parties, and there essentially is a lot of trust placed in that system. And so essentially it seems as though, as the system requires more trust in it \u2014 and that\u2019s where things can get manipulated in terms of the price and the ratios, the price of gold or the reserve ratios required, or the way you can extend credit in such a system. So, can you tell us a little bit about the importance of trust in that system and perhaps the mistakes that were made along the way?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous [09:38]: If you read The Bitcoin Standard, and I think you and I \u2014 the way that we think \u2014 generally we see this move from gold to fiat as just being a completely horrible mistake! And I think the focus there in that view which I think is highly justified, is that, you look at the salability across time of gold. You look at the stock to flow of gold, and you see that it offered us a safe haven. It offered everybody a neutral medium of saving an atypical money that was international, it was available for anybody! You could start saving from the day you were born and keep saving until you die and the same gold coins can continue value throughout your life. And you could take them anywhere in the world! And because it had a very high stock to flow ratio, substituting that with government money which had a much higher stock to flow ratio, at very high cost to society and civilization which I\u2019m sure you and your listeners are very well familiar with. But I think in a sense you would like it if those governments and central banks ran these systems based on gold, but if you start thinking about it in terms of engineering terms, if you have gold you are effectively having to trust in these people anyway. The gold has no \u2014 once you see Bitcoin and you see how Bitcoin functions and you can run your own node and you can run the numbers \u2014 once you see how this system works, you start to really think, you can see where the shortcoming of gold is from the fact that just moving gold around \u2014 salability across space in gold \u2014 is pretty inadequate for the 19th and 20th century. Well for the 19th it could keep up I guess, but for the 20th was when it really couldn\u2019t keep up. And in that sense, whether it was the Bank of England or the US Federal Reserve, they did offer superior salability across space. I think we kind of have to grudgingly admit that fiat just allows you to send money across the world in a way that becomes much more efficient than having to lug gold pieces around, because lugging gold around is expensive and risky. And if you just hand over the entire system to the government where you rely on the trust of the government, then the government runs its own accounts, it does its own magic, and your money gets from point A to point B. But, you know, occasionally it blows up, and it\u2019s usually bleeding value, but you can\u2019t have everything in life! And obviously there was no real free market competition. We couldn\u2019t build a free market alternative around gold because the nature of its centralization means that you have to be moving along with the legal and political and traditional institutions of the country in which you\u2019re operating the system. So I think it is really the salability across space that is what gives fiat its advantage, and it\u2019s what led to the compromise of the monetary supply. And you see that the story of how slowly but surely they went off gold, and then even though the price of gold could rise, it still could not displace a national currency because you just couldn\u2019t build a monetary system around gold. So everybody is stuck speculating on national currencies and trying to figure out which one of them is going to be the least worst.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [13:08]: Yeah. Also, one point that stuck out to me in Chapter 2 is you mention here about how essentially the government will manipulate the price of gold in terms of \u2014 that\u2019s one of the things that they would try to do. One idea that comes up here is the devaluation of the pound to allow the banks\u2019 reserves to back the currency. And you point out here that this would be unspeakably unpopular. The question then is, do you think people\u2019s attitudes towards these things have shifted these days? And perhaps were they more cognizant of these matters back then?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous [13:46]: Yeah it\u2019s quite interesting. I think about fiat in first principles terms. The whole book is almost modeled after The Bitcoin Standard in that I\u2019m trying to locate parallels for each. And so I went back to 1914 in the beginning of the war and looking at how fiat came about. How we moved from gold \u2014 and you see, back then, I think this is a really important fact \u2014 that there was no Satoshi and there was no designer and there was no idea about where they were headed with this design. There was no vision in 1914\u201315 as these countries came off the gold standard. There was no end goal in anybody\u2019s mind that in 1973 there would be no link whatsoever between gold and money. In the mind of everybody, the question was, When do we return to gold? How do we return to gold? And it was well understood that the return to gold had to happen. The Sterling Pound was a matter of national pride in England, and they\u2019ve been on this rate of 4 pounds \u2014 I forget the exact rate for 1 oz of gold \u2014 they\u2019d been at that since Isaac Newton himself had set that rate, so it\u2019d been around for 200 years. It was only interrupted during the Napoleonic War, but they returned back to the original price! So during the first world war, it was initially well understood that we\u2019re going back on a gold standard and yet they managed to drag this on for 50\u201360 years and never went back on the gold standard. And we moved on to this system that really emerged politically out of the politics of World War I and World War II \u2014 not through design.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [15:36]: Right. Another really interesting point I saw from Chapter 2 is this discussion around this idea of exporting inflation. There\u2019s this idea that other countries are using either the US dollar or UK sterling, and in some sense, the US and the UK can benefit from this, because they can unload some of their \u2014 they\u2019ve got more bag holders, right?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Exactly! Exactly! This is \u2014digging in Chapter 2, I\u2019ve really come to realize the importance of something that is called the gold exchange standard. And this was a system where Great Britain had implemented with its colonies in the late 19th century, where \u2014 with some of its colonies \u2014 whose central banks essentially kept their reserves in London in the form of English pounds. And so, the Bank of England made a great trade on selling these colonies claims on gold which effectively these countries weren\u2019t going to cash out very frequently, because they needed them in the Bank of England network. They needed them on the Bank of England platform, because they were using this to settle their accounts with all the other central banks for buying stuff. This was their foreign account, essentially. So it was kept in London so the Bank of England didn\u2019t really have to fulfill withdrawals for this very frequently, and at the outbreak of World War I they had only 31% reserves of gold to back up the English pounds that were outstanding for the countries that were on the gold exchange standard. So that ultimately was the driver of the problems of the Bank of England. That\u2019s why they had to \u2014 not officially, they didn\u2019t officially go off the gold standard because they wanted to maintain their position as the financial center and they kept on insisting that that was never going to happen, but the problem started because of this, and the solution, in typical fashion\u2014 to fashion the solution out of the problem \u2014what they did was they effectively sought to export this model to the rest of the world after World War I by implementing all these new international arrangements whereby other countries needed to hold English sterling pounds in order to settle their accounts. And so there was the Treaty of Genoa in 1922 where the US and the UK basically dumped their bags of mainly sterling \u2014 the US did a little bit of dumping \u2014 but it was really the UK that had the most bags because they had gone off the gold standard in 1914. The US did not go off the gold standard until 1917. So for the first three years of the war, the UK and the rest of Europe were bleeding gold to the US. The US only really left the gold standard in 1917 so they still had quite more gold and were in much better shape than Britain. And the US was able to go back to the gold standard in 1922 but the UK was not. So then this became popular \u2014 the gold exchange standard \u2014 they get all these countries to hold pound sterling, and usually it came along with talk about financial stability and international cooperation and, We\u2019re gonna need you to do your part by holding our bags for us while we print more sterling. And then this became more and more popular, and then this was basically what they did with the Bretton Woods Agreement, where the US copied the model and took it over from the Brits, and started dumping their dollar bags on the rest of the world. It\u2019s the same thing \u2014 it\u2019s the gold exchange standard \u2014 wherein all those countries don\u2019t get to use the gold themselves! They get to use the pound or the dollar which are backed by gold, and they get to have a promise that, Okay, your paper is redeemable as long as you don\u2019t try and redeem it in any significant quantities!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [20:10]: Right! And over time they start to shut the windows in which you are able to claim it back. So at the start it\u2019s open generally, but then later it becomes more like, Oh no! It\u2019s only if you\u2019re a commercial bank. And then later it\u2019s only if you\u2019re a central bank that you\u2019re allowed to claim back, right?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Yeah! And then nobody basically, and then they just shut it up entirely in 1971! WTF Happened In 1971? As always.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [20:40]: It\u2019s very unfortunate. And so, it takes some time as well for that process to happen. I guess it\u2019s a process of capture. So the better your monetary good can resist it, well, the better you are as a society, stopping a cultural and societal degeneration, in certain respects. It\u2019s also important to \u2014 just talk a little bit about the politics of revaluations? There was a sense of, when the government or the central bank and they\u2019re negotiating and deciding, like, Oh okay, you\u2019re coming to the table and you\u2019ve got this much gold. And so that is like an indicator of how much power or relative strength you have versus the other \u201cplayers\u201d at the table. So there\u2019s a bit of a power dynamic game there based on how much gold you have. But that dynamic has obviously shifted in today\u2019s world, that we could argue that gold is not seen as that important even though central banks of today \u2014 some of them \u2014 still hold gold, right?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous [21:54]: Ownership of gold is pretty important because obviously central banks still own it. And it\u2019s still the one monetary asset that is free from any incumbrance \u2014 well, up until Bitcoin came along \u2014 it was the only monetary asset. It had that. So it\u2019s still kind of a big deal, obviously. But to be fair, I think it\u2019s really more about who is able to command an international settlement network, really. That\u2019s ultimately what it comes down to. If you\u2019re able to secure physically an international settlement network, if you\u2019re able to secure a settlement banking network that allows people to transact across borders, if you have the security over that, then it ultimately doesn\u2019t even matter if you run it on gold tokens or if you run it on fiat tokens. I guess it\u2019s not accurate to say that \u2014 it does matter \u2014 because ultimately, if you\u2019re running it on your own tokens, we see what happens. It has to eventually become politically motivated. Eventually it gets captured, and it\u2019s going to inevitably lead to all the problems that come with political capture of money, that have always come with political capture of money. Whereas if you had it linked to a hard asset, it would be very different. So one problem this shows us in the fiat standard is: it un-solved [reverted] the problem of money, in a sense. Because it prevents us from having this one monetary medium that everybody uses. This one universal medium, which is what we had with gold. At the early 20th century gold had pretty much already demonetized silver at that point, so it really was only gold. So we finally had this problem solved where everybody everywhere in the world was using one thing as money, and then fiat comes along and it introduces all these other tokens. And then there\u2019s gold \u2014 that can\u2019t be completely demonetized. And if you\u2019re looking for salability across space, if you want to spend money in the town next-door and in the country next to you and in the other continents of the world, then you\u2019re going to need some combination of various fiats. But if you want to save money for the future, if you want salability across time, if you\u2019re thinking about something that you want to keep for the future, then you end up having to think about gold. And so you have to hold some gold! And so this really un-solves [reverts] the problem of money, because now you have to \u2014 you have a much more sophisticated and complicated and error-prone calculation of: how much of my money should I allocate for salability across time \u2014 should I prioritize for the future? And how much of my money should I prioritize for the present \u2014 for salability across space, by putting it in fiat. And of course, if you live outside the US, then most likely you have to keep more than one currency in mind as well, so you end up with people having to think about gold and their local fiat currency and the dollar. It just gives everybody much more mental arithmetic to perform about money, and it makes the process of saving and the process of having a cash balance much more sophisticated and complicated than really it should be. Because if you had one form of money, it would be the one form of money that would have the best salability across space and time, and then you could just have that stash there for all your interspatial and intertemporal needs.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [25:58]: Yeah that\u2019s a really nice way of putting it. The combination there of the time and space. Moving to Chapter 3 then: you\u2019ve got this idea of the underlying technology behind fiat. Can you tell us a little bit about what the fiat system looks like?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Yeah I tried to look at fiat as a digital currency, because it is a digital currency, let\u2019s remember. Something like 90% of all fiat tokens are digital. It\u2019s only about 10% of them that get printed out on their primitive OpenDimes, which are made out of paper. It\u2019s still a digital currency, and if you start thinking about it in that sense, it\u2019s easier to make sense of how the network works. So if you think about the node in Bitcoin \u2014 what is the equivalent of the node in the fiat system? There\u2019s really only one full node in the fiat system. There\u2019s one sovereign fiat node in all the entire fiat system and it\u2019s the US Federal Reserve. And that is the only node that is able to decide definitively on the correct record of transactions and on the balances. It can revoke anybody\u2019s balance and it can add new coins to anybody\u2019s balance anywhere. They can shut off entire countries and they can take money from any account and they can cancel any transactions and so on. So it\u2019s really the Federal Reserve that\u2019s the one central node, and then there are the other nodes that are similar to SPV nodes that are the central banks. Which aren\u2019t really full nodes because they can\u2019t really truly decide the monetary supply of the token that is on the network. They can\u2019t decide the native token monetary supply. And they can\u2019t decide on the record of transactions. But they can verify payments and clear payments for people within their country. And then you have the mining nodes which are essentially any financial institution or any institution that can issue credit, that can borrow backed by the US government. These institutions are able to mine. They can\u2019t decide on the record of transactions, but they can mine. They\u2019re not full nodes, but they are mining nodes because they make new money. That\u2019s really the key analytical tool of this book, is that when you start thinking about what it means when you substitute the process of mining in Bitcoin with the process of lending. In Bitcoin you do proof of work in order to make new coins \u2014 to make new satoshis you need to do proof of work. In fiat you need to lend. You need to make a loan in order to make new coins.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [30:24]: So with that, it\u2019s really a massive power being given to those special privileged few who are able to lend out and essentially create new money. Now the government imposes all sorts of conditions and regulations and so on, on those banks and those financial institutions that are able to create new credit, but it is a massive power for them. There\u2019s a whole convoluted operation around this, right? Because it\u2019s not just \u2014 they sort of mask it with these different terms and processes around that. How would you talk about that obscuring of what\u2019s really going on?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: The reality is that it\u2019s just a decentralized system if you think about it. It emerges as a sort of \u2014 as the government takes on the provision of the currency, as the government guarantees the central banks\u2019 monopolies \u2014 monopoly and the banking monopoly \u2014 the government effectively becomes the [guarantor] of the banking system and that then means that the banking system\u2019s creation of credit allows for creation of new money. And so it means that there\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s not really easy to figure just how much money there is! The money supply is not very clear, because you never really know much credit is being created, and you never really know \u2014 and of course there\u2019s the issue of the maturity of different types of monies and what can count as money and what can\u2019t count as money. So supply is completely for most people. It\u2019s very hard to come up with a clear answer about what the supply is and there\u2019s different definitions.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: One other point that\u2019s also interesting to discuss is what\u2019s economic survival based on? In this chapter you\u2019re talking about, It\u2019s almost based on getting into larger debt, because you want to get present goods for future liabilities, right?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous [32:51]: Exactly! Yes. This is the key \u2014 the way that it just ends up. Which is why, the more that [you] read into this book, the more you realize that this is just \u2014 you see the technological underpinnings and the technological realities that create the incentives for these things to happen! And it makes it really look far less nefarious! It\u2019s not like \u2014 there are serious incentives for doing this because of the way that the system works. Once you have this guarantee of debt, it just becomes more profitable for you to get into debt, because every time you get into debt for something, you\u2019re allowing the person who\u2019s lending you \u2014 the financial institution that is lending you \u2014 you\u2019re allowing them to mine new tokens. And so think about it this way: when you\u2019re buying a house, you have the choice of either just buy a house, or buy a house and mine new fiat tokens. Imagine if that happened with Bitcoin: you can just buy a house with Bitcoin, or you can buy the house with somebody else\u2019s Bitcoin, and by buying a house with somebody else\u2019s Bitcoin, they get to mine new Bitcoin. They bring new Bitcoin about! Which one of these things do you think is going to be cheaper? Obviously the second one is going to be cheaper in real terms because the lender has an incentive to make it cheaper for you \u2014 they would like you to do that \u2014 because if you don\u2019t do that and you buy the house in cash, they don\u2019t get to make new tokens!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [34:35]: Yeah it\u2019s a very dark system that we\u2019ve found ourselves in! And there\u2019s a whole host of other things that keep us in this world. Things like the fact that we have to use the fiat coin for tax payments, right?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: You\u2019ve got to stay in it \u2014 it\u2019s a monopoly! It\u2019s a single system that\u2019s a monopoly system. It\u2019s a consequence of the fact that it\u2019s a monopoly that it ends up becoming so dysfunctional. It\u2019s just the reality of the incentives that everybody faces. And in a sense, you could think about it as being a conspiracy in some way, but really the more you think the technological incentives there, you see why it makes sense from an economic perspective. In this kind of system is makes sense to get into more debt. In this system the people who succeed the most, the companies who succeed the most, are ones who are able to take on the most debt, while skirting the line of profitability, and not sinking into bankruptcy! That\u2019s really the key! You just need to keep on running up a bigger loan and going from one loan to the other, and the key to do that is to have enough cash flow to continue to make your payments so you continue to make sure that your credit [inaudible 36:08] increases so that\u2019ll allow you to grow in size. This is just how the system ends up working! You can see how it just makes sense once you made it so that it is a financial system that is guaranteed by the government, it\u2019s just going to end up being this way, even though it\u2019s motivated by what sounds like such good idea \u2014 let\u2019s just guarantee the banking system and prevent it from collapsing because you wouldn\u2019t want people to lose their savings! Savings are good \u2014 let\u2019s guarantee savings! Well you end up just destroying savings and plunging everybody into debt!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [36:48]: With the access to credit, obviously a big big beneficiary is the government itself! It can become so much larger and as you point out, the central bank and the government they have this whole song and dance, but in reality governments are very much funded through government bonds. And guess what? Central banks are the main market maker in government bonds! This is one of those points where, people who are not as into the Austrian economics of it\u2014like reading and understanding what\u2019s going on and how the is government funding itself \u2014they don\u2019t see this idea that fiat as a standard is what\u2019s enabled the government to be so large, wouldn\u2019t you say?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous [37:29]: Absolutely! Government can just interfere at any market in any good anywhere and tip the balances in any way it wants! Because it can just allocate an infinite amount of tokens as long as the currency doesn\u2019t collapse! Of course the currency can collapse often and it does collapse. But until then, they can decide to go in and buy from this producer, not buy from that producer. They can decide what happens to \u2014 they can decide to allocate credits to one kind of producers and not the other, and that will completely shape the shape of the markets! It\u2019s an enormous amount of power that they are allowed to allocate. And it\u2019s massively distortionary of the market process, and that\u2019s the thing that I focus on in the second part of the book, Fiat Life. Trying to think of the downstream economic, social, political, and cultural effects of this kind of system, wherein, A) you\u2019re losing the hardness of money, so money is now much easier than gold. And you know with varying degrees across the world but still easier than gold no doubt about it. And B) on the other hand you\u2019re also having this massive distortionary effect on markets where one monopoly entity can just come in and allocate infinite amounts of cash at any producer or consumer in the market.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [39:01]: I also really enjoyed one of the thought experiments you proposed here. You say, Imagine what would happen to a country that adopted a fiat standard before accumulating significant industrial capital. This is the developing world of today. Why is that?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Having studied this history, I really think the start of World War I \u2014 and the abandonment of the gold standard \u2014 marked really a very pivotal point in history. Because if your country had adopted industrialization and the gold standard, which usually came hand in hand \u2014 by the time you had a gold standard, you needed a gold standard because you had developed enough of the division of labor that you were importing and exporting so much that your producers needed something like a gold standard \u2014 so once a country had a gold standard and became industrialized, that country will have developed a basic industrial base and have sound money. After World War I happened, if your country had not done that by then \u2014 these countries became the developing world, more or less\u2014 these countries had not developed enough industrial capacity and had not imported enough of the modern technologies of the industrial revolution by the early 20th, and were still agrarian economies \u2014 after 1914, there would be no more gold standard for them to trade with the rest of the world, and world trade would just get messed up, so they never managed to get to that level of industrialization and that was a massive impediment in their development.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [40:48]: Yeah that\u2019s a really interesting point to think about."}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: If I can just add \u2014 this is from Hayek. I think it was Hayek that mentioned this in some form and I quote him in his book, Monetary Nationalism and International Stability, he mentions these countries that had never developed a gold standard and then, when the developed world went off the gold standard, these countries \u2014 their development was massively compromised by the fact that they didn\u2019t have a global trading system from which to be able to import the capital they needed. And all of these things carried on for a while.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [41:37]: It spells out the importance of the overarching need for capital accumulation and a proper structure for society to actually become prosperous, and that if you don\u2019t get the right pieces and the right ingredients then it can really stop a country from prospering like many of the other Western world nations have."}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Absolutely. It\u2019s completely detrimental if you\u2019re not able to have a sound money. If you think about it, the countries that didn\u2019t develop industrially by the early 20th century, they spent the rest of the 20th century \u2014 most of them \u2014 going through one financial crisis and one hyperinflation and high inflation, all of these coming one after the other all throughout the last century or so. These countries that didn\u2019t develop this monetary tradition of sound money and didn\u2019t adopt industrialization just \u2014 by the 1940\u2019s and 50\u2019s and 60\u2019s when they were trying to industrialize the world was so massively protected. And protectionism had increased so much \u2014 and protectionism had started to increase after World War I precisely because of the monetary problems caused by going off the gold standard. There was very little problem with trade before World War I because when they were on the gold standard, nobody had balance of payments problems. If people bought a lot of things from abroad they lost gold and the other country made more gold and carried on! You had more stuff they had more gold, or the other way around. And if you wanted more gold, stop buying stuff! If you want more stuff, stop hoarding gold! It was a simple economic decision that everybody had. But once the currencies became disconnected from gold and prices domestically started to vary and governments tried to keep the currencies nominally at the same interest rates, you would get a difference in real prices across countries, which would lead to large movements of capital and goods and trade changes. So for somebody, the pound was overvalued after World War I for instance, and because the pound is overvalued, the British are trying to get their gold out of Britain as much as they can because it would be profitable for them to just sell it in the US and get dollars for it and then exchange the dollars in London. And then the same thing happens with trade. The country that has an undervalued currency finds its goods becoming more and more attractive for foreigners and so started exporting more, and a country with an overvalued currency doesn\u2019t export and that causes problems for its producers. And so the whole thing leads to problems in trade and that leads to tariffs and all these restrictions on trade, which then really hamper the ability of the developing world to catch up, because they hadn\u2019t grown \u2014 they didn\u2019t have a gold standard, and they didn\u2019t have access to world markets. And world markets weren\u2019t open as they used to be. I think the transfer of technology that we could\u2019ve had if we had stayed on the gold standard after 1914 would have been much much much larger. The developing world would have been in a much better shape if the gold standard had continued and would have been able to buy and sell. Because industrialization was spreading all around the world and engines were going everywhere and electricity was going up everywhere. World War I comes along and the gold standard falls and the whole thing goes to shit.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [46:03]: There\u2019s some hope there though!

It\u2019s quite amazing even in places like Lebanon, people just continue to maintain faith in this. I remember I was speaking to a group from Lebanon a few months ago when the Lira had lost something like 60\u201370% of its value at that time against the US dollar in just 6\u20137 months, and after presenting Bitcoin and the case for Bitcoin and the supply and all of that stuff, one of the first questions I got was, well without a central bank what guarantees the value of Bitcoin? From somebody living in Lebanon who just saw their central bank guaranteed currency lose 60\u201370% of its value, they still think of the central bank as being the reason that their currency is guaranteed to have value! They think that without the central bank, we wouldn\u2019t be able to have money and the money wouldn\u2019t be able to have value. The central bank messed up now \u2014 reasons happened \u2014 and now the currency has slipped up, but you know, things like that can happen to the best of us!

I remember teaching macroeconomics in Lebanon and coming across these lines in the macroeconomics textbook about government bonds being risk-free. I would laugh in class and would tell the students this is not true! There is no way that you can make something risk-free, let alone the bonds of your government! The government that had managed to destroy a power grid and un-invent electricity! It\u2019s not risk-free! Definitely not risk-free lending! But it\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s a mental construct that just has to emerge around fiat money where the government propaganda creates this idea that this thing is risk-free and everybody believes in it. It continues to work until it doesn\u2019t work. But there was never really a good reason to suspect it works.

{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous [52:43]: Yes! It\u2019s all \u2018we\u2019! There\u2019s that magical construct called we that just defies anything, it\u2019s amazing! I think accountants should cringe when they hear this we, because these are different accounting entities and you can\u2019t just put them all together and say, Well we all have balance sheets and they all have numbers so we\u2019re all one and the same! Because that we is made up for some people who are going to spend today, and some people are going to have to pay it back tomorrow! And that\u2019s just not the same people! The people getting to spend today are the economists with a fake job that tells you that debt is good for your children. And the people who are paying his salary are your children! And they probably could think of better things to do with their money than pay an economist to tell the world 30 years ago that debt is not gonna be a problem for them!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: Anyone with common sense can see that high debt in the government means that either your children or your grandchildren are going to be paying for that in some way. They\u2019re either paying explicitly or they\u2019re just paying in the sense of lost economic growth the prosperity. But the thing is a lot of these economists just like our friend Paul Krugman and the Paul Krugmans of the world who will come out and tell us, Oh no, see! You\u2019re assessing it just like a household. But see the government is different! It\u2019s not like a household. And there\u2019s this whole propaganda warfare around that."}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Yeah these people get paid from it so they have every interest in believing it. But it bears no relation to reality! That\u2019s not the way that it works. Ultimately, there are resources that need to be spent. And somebody needs to consume them and somebody\u2019s going to have to provide them. And all the emotional bullshit in the world can\u2019t hide behind that! That\u2019s the scam of fiat. Basically everybody\u2019s being enslaved to their future self. Or everybody is enslaving their future self, I should say. You\u2019re putting your future self in debt for yourself, for you to be able to spend tomorrow. And everybody is stuck in that. The sad thing about it \u2014 well it\u2019s not very sad \u2014 you have to stay on this treadmill even as you start getting more money. It\u2019s not like the rich people can just\u2014 well I mean they can obviously \u2014 but if they just opt out of the system they would be giving up on serious wealth. Whereas if they just take on more debt, then they\u2019ll be able to essentially beat inflation. So everybody has an incentive to stay on the treadmill. Everybody has an incentive to stay indebted. Everybody has an incentive to continue to live with a relatively close margin to economic problems and economic hardships and massive financial instability in their lives because everything is running on debt, everything is fragile, a couple of mispaid checks and business goes bad and you lose the business. So this kind of stress takes its toll on people, and the way that the fiat system works is that the only way that you can opt out of this \u2014 no matter how much money you have \u2014 is through giving up on significant money. If you don\u2019t get into debt, you\u2019re being the sucker of the inflation game. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s financing everybody else\u2019s mining.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [56:07]: It seems very much that even if you look online at the people who are teaching other people how to create wealth, it\u2019s all about how to best maneuver through the debt system. How to maneuver so that you can get into debt and flip houses or do some other kind of scheme that involves using the financial system in this aggressive way."}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Absolutely. You look at it all over and you start realizing that for small businesses and for large businesses, one of the most important components of success is knowing how to manage debt. And managing debt successfully \u2014 particularly for large businesses \u2014 basically debt arbitrage, interest rate arbitrage. This is what large companies do. Many large companies are essentially hedge funds today. If you think about what IBM does \u2014 IBM\u2019s a hedge fund! They are big enough that they can get cheaper credit than pretty much anyone, and they invest very far and very wide and that\u2019s ultimately more of their business I think at this point than anything else! So really managing debt and managing the process of creating debt and borrowing and lending is the key to success. Which I think is quite wasteful! Because if you had had an advanced monetary system like Bitcoin you\u2019d just have computers doing the slave work! It wouldn\u2019t have to be mining every day by getting into debt and worrying about our finances and worrying about missing two paychecks and becoming homeless and so on. You wouldn\u2019t have this insecurity with your house with your job \u2014 all of this fragility \u2014 because you\u2019re having to mine. You\u2019ll just have computers doing the mining! Sounds like such an infinitely more advanced and better system!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [57:55]: I\u2019m also thinking now of what people are doing in response to creation of Bitcoin and the existence of the fiat system. Almost some of the most recent news with Microstrategy deciding to issue debt to buy Bitcoin, obviously our friend Pierre Rochard who spoke about this and wrote about this in 2014 \u2014 in some ways it\u2019s almost like a real validation or a vindication of that strategy \u2014 that because as you were saying it was about managing your debt, but now that the world is slowly, we think, monetizing into Bitcoin, it\u2019s almost like a validation of that idea wouldn\u2019t you say?"}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous [58:33]: Absolutely! It\u2019s incredible to watch it happen in front of us exactly as foretold by our glorious leader Pierre Rochard!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: Also related to that as well, it\u2019s that people are looking for an alternative because \u2014 now that interest rates are becoming so low and we know for example that governments don\u2019t want to let interest rates rise because that would raise their debt cost and their debt servicing \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like, this is the new way to exploit the system."}
{"prompt": "Saifedean Ammous: Absolutely! When you think about the fiat standard, when I studied it, my conclusion is that, Yeah, try and get into as much debt as you can! Try and get as much Bitcoin as you can! That\u2019s really the winning way of playing this game, because Bitcoin is a hard asset, they can\u2019t make more of it, but they can make more fiat. So if you\u2019re playing the fiat game, if you\u2019re able to get debt, you\u2019re able to get ahead with it, unfortunately. But if you\u2019re able to secure with Bitcoin \u2014 the incredible thing is that now we have the entrepreneurial opportunity to bootstrap the alternative to the debt-based system. Instead of having to continue to monetize debt and continue to live in this world where everybody has to get into debt, and everybody has to mine debt in order to continue to function economically, you can start monetizing a hard asset. And you monetize this hard asset by holding Bitcoin and are effectively rewarded for this entrepreneurial bet on Bitcoin through the significant amount of NgU technology that is happening. The rise in the price of Bitcoin is the entrepreneurial call being successful. This thing is rising, and it shows that the value of this monetary system is increasing. As this continues to go up, we have the alternative to that! That\u2019s the lesson. In the long run, I think one plausible attack vector you could think about is that there would be some kind of separation where you can\u2019t buy Bitcoin if you get into fiat debt or vice versa. This might be one way that they begin to fight back to try and prevent this kind of thing, but otherwise, it\u2019s really exciting to watch this going on as long as it can! Because, you know, Godspeed to Michael Saylor as he continues to see just how much of the fiat of Wall Street he can get into the soundness of Bitcoin!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: As you point out, this kind of strategy is not available to everybody. Not everybody can borrow at cheap interest rates for this purpose. Perhaps for the typical individual they can get a loan for something like a house for a relatively low rate, but not necessarily to get Bitcoin at the same rate. Of course, people will find ways and there will probably be people doing this kind of thing. As you were mentioning it\u2019s about being responsible in how people are doing it as well because there certainly are a lot cases where people go into debt and try these kinds of high leverage strategies and end up getting rekt. Let\u2019s just make sure listeners aren\u2019t thinking, Oh yeah! Let\u2019s just maximize \u2014 it is certainly a risk also."}

And much more liberating and I think this is the kind of world that we\u2019d like to have where people can do their businesses and services online and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing the next chapters of The Fiat Standard as they become available. Saifedean, thank you very much for joining me on the show today!"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Thanks for having me! That was a very lovely introduction!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah man! This is amazing! I\u2019m really psyched to talk to you! You\u2019re very influential on my understanding or coming to grips with Bitcoin. I was revisiting your work\u2014because I\u2019ve kept up with your stuff since 2017 for the most part, and there\u2019s so much to cover \u2014 but when I was revisiting your work, there were a couple things that really stood out to me, maybe because of who I am? One, you\u2019re an educator, and two you\u2019re a goal-setter. You achieve goals. And you\u2019ve contributed to Bitcoin Core. And I think about those three things, and we can go into why those things stick out to me. But my question to you is: Bitcoin changes you is an expression. You can\u2019t change Bitcoin \u2014 it changes you! And I was thinking about that and it\u2019s relation to you, and your work that you\u2019ve put out. And when you speak, I kind of hear, like, Bitcoin Core! I kind of hear, like, the voice from the inside! It was even striking to me how you alliterate your articles! And your writing. And I wonder, how did Bitcoin change you, and do you think working on Bitcoin Core changed you differently than maybe people who learn about Bitcoin from a very different lens? Because I think, Well, maybe Bitcoin\u2019s changing me from the outside in? But maybe Bitcoin changed you from the inside out? I\u2019m not sure!"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song [02:40]: That\u2019s a really good question! I would say that Bitcoin has changed me in a lot of ways. But it\u2019s part of I think just coming into maturity just as a man, and Bitcoin was a part of that process. I\u2019m 44 years old, and when I started this journey I was 35 or something like that. You know, I have kids and everything, and part of coming to terms with having a family and trying to provide for my family and things like that brought certain questions to my mind, especially after 2008. About, How am I going to prep for their future? And things like that. Because it was clear to me after 2008 that this system was extremely fragile. And when I saw Bitcoin, when I found out about it, I think it really struck a chord with me in large part because of what I was looking for, which was a good place to park my money, actually! To invest and put something towards the future! And that sort of low time preference, long term time orientation kind of view, that\u2019s what really struck me about Bitcoin, and that\u2019s something that has been developed in me as a result of Bitcoin. Not the least of which is Bitcoin itself! I put out a Tweet the other day, I used to love shopping for bargains! I\u2019d go all the websites for the bargain deals and I\u2019d feel awesome when I\u2019d get something like $100 less than what everyone else paid for it, or whatever. I mean I used to do like the crazy rebate games and stuff like that, I\u2019d get things for free and sell them on Craigslist afterwards. Just all kinds of stupid crap like that! And realizing that most of that is stupid! Because in a sense, when you have Bitcoin, which stores value really well, you\u2019re not going to go and buy needless crap, because if you just wait a little longer, you\u2019re gonna get something much better! And you\u2019re gonna get it for a much better price, because in terms of Bitcoin, those things are all going down in price. I would say the main way in which Bitcoin\u2019s changed me is a part of coming into maturity, part of who I\u2019m becoming, and that\u2019s just having a lower time preference, thinking much more about the long term, and things like that.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [05:23]: Do you think with your background as a programmer that you maybe looked at yourself a little more introspectively and were able to reprogram yourself very quickly? You know? There\u2019s a big difference between, I\u2019m not gonna go and buy that thing, but I want it! Versus, like, I no longer want that thing! Coming from more of a first principle, and inside out?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Yeah I would say that it\u2019s a little bit of both. I learn to be pretty introspective as a programmer, you have to analyze things. A lot of people don\u2019t believe me when I say this about being a programmer: it\u2019s actually very emotional! Especially when a project you\u2019ve been working on 24/7 for three months gets cut and then you have to come to terms with the fact that you worked on something that no one\u2019s gonna use or whatever. Or you work on something and a lot more people like it, even though it took you five minutes. Like that was a critical thing for them, or something like that! There\u2019s a lot of \u2014 that internal, emotional management aspect of it is something I did have at least a little bit of through my experience in programming. But I would be lying if I said that I had really good self-control at the same place I am now, nine years ago. That just wasn\u2019t the case! The thing that changed with Bitcoin was that I started to recognize what it really meant to save. And what it really meant to be able to put off till later \u2014 you know, let some things go! Instead of wanting things Now now now. I\u2019ve always sort of been a little bit that way anyway, with the exception of a few things, but this really encouraged it and put the better angel of my nature in charge, rather than the devil of wanting things now. And I would say that those two worked in sync and I\u2019ve been able to save a lot more \u2014 recently \u2014 because of the things that developed as a result of being in Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [08:05]: We\u2019re around the same age, and I think that kind of gives us a similar \u2014 not a lot of similarities, I\u2019m not Jimmy Song \u2014 but similar life trajectory in the sense that we came to Bitcoin a little older, and we had a career before we came to Bitcoin. And I wonder, were you always cool, calm and collected? I find Bitcoin gives me a lot of zen. I see you, I think of you as very zenful. Was it before or after Bitcoin? Were you always cool, calm and collected?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: I would say not! Actually, my temper comes out sometimes! You could ask my kids or you could ask people on stream like I did last week on the election. There are times I just go off on people or whatever. But I would say that there is a sense in which I\u2019ve learned to moderate some of my emotions. But that\u2019s more a result of getting more attention on Twitter and so on, and less Bitcoin. That\u2019s just something I learned as a result of \u2014 like, 2013, nobody knew who I was but I was on Twitter and I was Tweeting about Bitcoin. I\u2019d get like 3 likes and people would argue with me and I would get really angry and say nasty things! All kinds of stuff like that! In a sense, going through those early was a real blessing because I learned to recognize, Okay, most people won\u2019t change their mind on a public forum in any way, shape, or form. And second, you can let them win a little! It\u2019s okay! If somebody gets the last word in, let them get that little win, and you\u2019ll be \u2014 it\u2019s not gonna hurt you any. You may think it does, but it doesn\u2019t! Most people aren\u2019t gonna see those comments, and the people that do are gonna think less of the people that made those comments than the response that you gave. I think that that definitely affected me more in that direction, although I don\u2019t rule out the possibility that Bitcoin has had something to do with that aspect as well. Certainly, having to speak a lot and talk on podcasts and things like that, I think for me were a bigger influence.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [10:40]: What about the change in direction of your career? Going from a coder/programmer to maybe something you\u2019re more passionate about?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Yeah! That\u2019s something that \u2014 now that I\u2019m not beholden to a company \u2014 I really wish I did earlier! And it actually took me a while. I think it was middle of 2017 when I really decided, Okay, you know what? I\u2019m gonna go off on my own instead of working for a company. Even the four years from 2013\u20132017 \u2014 I was working for Bitcoin companies \u2014 which is great, because I get to work on Bitcoin-related stuff, but it was not that satisfying because I wasn\u2019t working on what I wanted to, and it took me a month and a half of just getting up the gumption to go do it, to go off on my own and say, Alright, you know what? I\u2019m gonna give this thing a shot! And I might fall on my face, but I\u2019ll always have a programming career to go back to! Might as well give it a shot! As soon as I started it \u2014 and I found some success doing that \u2014 I was just like, Why didn\u2019t I do this ten years ago? Because I was just like \u2014 one of the things that I recognized was like, my opinions in large ways were beholden to my company! The company that I was working for! And in subtle ways, and in more overt ways, but my mind wasn\u2019t my own when I was working for them! The golden handcuffs of salary, they consume your soul in some ways! And the ability to detach from that, to have my own voice and to say whatever the hell I feel like. You know, just have my own thing going \u2014 that was enormously freeing! And you\u2019re probably right, that definitely had an effect on my perspective and maybe how I come across and things like that. You go to a conference and you listen to a speaker that\u2019s shilling their latest altcoin or whatever, and then you hear somebody like Tone Vays speak, it\u2019s a completely different experience, because one is obviously working for somebody, and they\u2019re being sycophants to whoever is giving them the money. But when you tell the truth with the conviction of real belief, it makes a big difference! And it comes across a different way! You have a different impact on people, and I think maybe that\u2019s the main thing that I\u2019ve gotten out of going off on my own into this Bitcoin entrepreneur journey.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [13:44]: Yeah. I really want to touch on this: middle of 2017 \u2014 my first question there is, How much do you think going from that beholden point where you work for someone else, to being your freer person. At that moment in time, does your voice get more clear and chiseled? Or are you literally just releasing thoughts that have been pent up? I think that there\u2019s like a fork in the road that you almost can\u2019t have certain thoughts until you\u2019ve left those binds!"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Well, that\u2019s an excellent way to put it! It really was kind of like that! There\u2019s like a barrier, you can\u2019t express yourself fully because you\u2019re tied in golden handcuffs or something. You don\u2019t have that freedom of movement, the freedom of thought. And you could kind of see this in my writing too. In 2017 \u2014 the first half of 2017\u2014I was trying to be conciliatory to all sides, trying to calm people down, try to thread the needle in between and say, Hey, you know what? I\u2019m this neutral person and everything else. And you can see in the second half of 2017 I started getting my own voice and saying \u2014 instead of writing what people wanted to hear, I started writing what I really thought! And that made all of the difference! People want to think what it is that you think for the reasons that you think it, instead of whatever the company line may be, or whatever might make them feel better. As much as people like things that make them feel better, it doesn\u2019t connect at a level that real truth does! So I think that was the main thing. It wasn\u2019t a lot of pent up stuff. I think to a degree, a large part of my \u2014 it\u2019s kind of like water that you\u2019re swimming in, you don\u2019t really recognize that your opinions are beheld that way, and that you\u2019re being moderate because you\u2019re put into a political position at your workplace that you didn\u2019t sign up for but you nevertheless have to play. It wasn\u2019t like that as it was like\u2014being free from that \u2014 my mind could now go wherever it wanted! I have always thought of myself as somebody that sought truth, and that\u2019s where it led me. That\u2019s ultimately I think what led me to write a lot of those things that I did. It seemed to connect really well with Bitcoin Twitter and so on.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [16:36]: Yeah. What do you think you would want for your children then? In terms of a career, a vocation. Is it like, you\u2019re gonna hand them a couple Bitcoin and be like, Go do what you wanna do! Is it gonna be like, I\u2019m gonna buy a car-wash and I\u2019ll give you 10% equity and $60,000 a year to work there for me and work your way through the equity ladder? How do you instill that stuff to your kids?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: That\u2019s something that I\u2019ve been thinking about for a long time. The best thing that I\u2019ve come up with is just give them the tools to succeed, and then see what they want to do, and don\u2019t let fear get in the way of their trying things. Because to me, the hardest hurdle to overcome\u2014the month and a half where I was pondering whether or not I should go off on my own \u2014 it was getting over that fear! It kind of sounds silly right now that it took me a month and a half to get over that fear, but that\u2019s what it took. Literally every night just thinking, Oh okay. If I do this, okay. And I made lists and said, Okay here are the pros, here are the cons, here is the worst case scenario, here\u2019s blah blah blah. And ultimately \u2014 at some point you have to move! You have to do something! You have to take a step! After I took that step it was like, What the hell was I worried about? Navigating the free market and finding a product that other people will find interesting and will pay for isn\u2019t this crazy difficult thing that they make it out to be! I\u2019ve been absolutely shocked at some of the things that I\u2019ve been able to sell to people, and oftentimes they\u2019ll come to me and ask me for it! And I was like, Hey, I didn\u2019t even know that this was something that you\u2019d want, but okay! I\u2019ve done it for you, now lets go do it for like 30 other people. And you make a bunch of money! In a sense, that\u2019s the mentality that I would love to instill in my kids and give them that sense that the world\u2019s your oyster! It\u2019s not something to be afraid of, you just need to have certain skills to be able to navigate it. But you don\u2019t need to be beholden to a company because in many ways, that would probably be one of the worst outcomes that I could imagine. Which is that they go to a company and sort of live out their existence in \u201cquiet desperation\u201d to quote Thoreau. That would be the worst possibility for me! I would want them to live and take risks and break things and try something and fail! That\u2019s when you actually learn things! And I gotta tell you! I\u2019ve failed in a bunch of things since the middle of 2017. I\u2019ve tried a bunch of things and was like, Yeah, that\u2019s not gonna work. I was able to fail quickly and learn from it. And other things it was like, Hey, this works! And it works for a certain amount of time. That\u2019s what I would like to instill is: that sense of entrepreneurship, of risk-taking, of this mandate to actually add something to the world, not by doing what someone tells you but by using your own mind and creativity and skills to find some piece of the market that needs something that you can fulfill.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [20:30]: I wonder where you encourage them to spend their time? Do you want them to be programmers and coders? That seems like a way, in my mind, for people to be Bitcoin cashflow sovereign, or something like being a voice, but that\u2019s really hard to do without a skillset or a background or experiences to fall on. Like I don\u2019t want my a 20-year-old influencer on YouTube per say, even though he\u2019s dying to be one of these YouTube stars playing video games and making videos games and showing people how to do it. Or making it entertaining for them. His stars are of today, for him. What would you?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: I would say that programming is definitely useful, and there are all kinds of other skills that are extremely useful. Like being able to put up a drywall or weld something or fix a car. All those things are just extremely useful skills. And combining them in interesting ways and figuring out holes in the market, needs in the market that you can fulfill, that\u2019s really the main thing to teach, for me, is that ability to find a need in the market that you can fulfill, and then go do it and market it in a proper way so that you get some business. That to me is way more effective than learning a set skill. Like, programming is kind of a unique skill in that it can be fitted towards lots and lots of different things, but most jobs in the economy are not like that! They\u2019re very much cookie-cutter, and it\u2019s like, Oh, we need an accountant, and we need a lawyer, and whatever. All of those things have very specific credentials around them and things like that. I get why they need to exist, but they\u2019re not, at least for me, that creative, or that fulfilling. My kids might think differently! And I\u2019m open to seeing how they see the world! To a degree, to get the best match for your skills and passions and whatever makes money \u2014 to get the best fit for that, you need to go out into the market yourself and not go into a cookie-cutter role that they ask for in the marketplace. That would be my main lesson to teach them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [23:29]: You have a lot of lessons! You\u2019re an educator! It really comes through and it\u2019s very effective! You had a blog post\u2014I think it was in 2019 \u2014 My Story of Setting Goals. It\u2019s just one of these things that\u2019s so simple, but in my view, very honest. Because you\u2019re sharing your story and your achievements, and a lot of people are very selfish with those things. They don\u2019t want to share what they were thinking when, and what they accomplished, and the sauce. And inspire others, maybe. You wrote, Back in May of 2017 I had just broken 1,000 followers on Twitter. Now you got something like over 180,000 followers on Twitter. And you outline here, I\u2019m gonna write some goals. And you wrote down some goals in 2017 when you had 1,000 followers. And you wrote down, I want to be a keynote to a conference, travel to five continents and do something Bitcoin related, create my own business and write a book, and you put it on a 5-year horizon which I think is fantastic! It\u2019s what Pierre Rochard talks a little bit about on the show \u2014 humans thinking a little bit more longer term. And you banged these things out in 18 months!"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song [24:49]: Yeah! And that was an absolute shocker to me! That I was able to do that in 18 months! And if you want some tips on goal setting, there\u2019s a really cool Jordan Peterson goal setting workshop that I use to actually set those goals. And basically he just asks you a bunch of questions and you answer them as honestly as possible, and that\u2019s how I came up with those goals. And yeah, did I think I would achieve them in 18 months? Absolutely not! Did I even think that I was going to be able to achieve them in 5 years? Absolutely not! But it came in large part because goals have that effect where, you notice opportunities that fit your goals because you have them. Because you\u2019re focused on the endpoint, you\u2019re able to see how opportunities that you might have now can fit towards those goals! And I think that\u2019s definitely what happened! About two months after that I went off on my own and started my own business teaching programmers, and a couple months after this I got invited to my first conference and lo and behold they wanted me to keynote the first day! I was the very first speaker on the first day of that conference. And it was a brand new conference, I was like, I haven\u2019t really spoken before but okay! Alright, this is what I wanted! So I ended up doing that. A month after that a friend of mine approached me about writing a book together, and then we explored things, and he wanted to drop out so it ended up being me, and I ended up getting a contract with O\u2019Reilly to write a book. Not The Little Bitcoin book, but the Programming Bitcoin book. That ended up happening. You know, and I got invited to different conferences and I was like, Okay, let\u2019s see where it is. And it ended up that I did travel to five continents! All of those things happened because I was looking for those opportunities and I had some goals in mind! I think goal setting is absolutely crucial if you want to get some things done. I have different goals now. We\u2019ll see how those come to pass! But yeah, I\u2019m a big believer in how much the goals actually focus you towards them. And they almost call out to you and draw you to them like magnets. It\u2019s a worthwhile exercise to do, even if it\u2019s scary emotionally, which it is for most people.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [27:48]: That\u2019s what I was just gonna ask, Was it hard for you to be honest with yourself? A lot of people listening to these workshops, the Jordan Peterson one included \u2014 you talked about these magnets. You put the goal out there and it becomes this magnet. But I think it\u2019s hard for a lot of people to be honest with themselves?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Yeah! And to admit what they really want! It\u2019s okay to want things \u2014 that\u2019s the big thing that I think a lot of people feel guilty about. It\u2019s like, Well I want fame and I want money and I want these things. It\u2019s okay to want those things! If you\u2019re honest about it that\u2019s okay! The thing I\u2019ve found is that oftentimes your perspective on those very things changes as you go closer towards them and you might not want them anymore! You mentioned your son wants to be a YouTube influencer showing people how to plan video games and so on, because that\u2019s what he\u2019s watching right now. I bet you after he finds out what their lives are really like in a few years, his perspective will change. And he\u2019ll say, You know what Dad? Maybe that\u2019s not for me! You have to play video games like 14 hours a day to get really good at it in order to be able to show it, and you have to have really good video skills and speaking skills and I tried public speaking and I\u2019m not very good at it, blah blah blah. So there\u2019s a lot of those kinds of things that can correct your path, and you might not want those things anymore, at which point, you can reset your goals. I feel like when I set those goals I was old enough at least know myself enough to know that those were within reach within five years. Those were things that I could do that were concrete, that weren\u2019t abstract, not knowing ever whether I ever actually reached those goals or not. The actual desire is okay to have. That\u2019s something that you kind of have to give yourself permission to have, and say, Alright, it\u2019s okay for me to want this in five years. I might change \u2014 you always leave yourself the out that, Hey, that\u2019s not what I want, and I\u2019m okay with not achieving that particular goal and I can go do something else. I guess that has to do with something like your perception of yourself versus who you really are, because a lot of people want to be somebody that they\u2019re not! Or they perceive themselves to be somebody that they\u2019re not! And being honest with yourself is hard for that reason. This is where having a spouse can be really, really helpful! It certainly was for me! Having her tell me her perspective of me definitely changed my perspective of me, and that helped me to set clear goals and be more honest with myself.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [31:02]: Yeah. Probably the only thing more important in life than finding Bitcoin is finding a partner for life. For sure."}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: In my course that I used to run, I\u2019ve taught over 600 people, something like that. The main thing that I learned is that people can learn really fast if they\u2019re motivated. So I learned something about education. If you read my book it\u2019s like a semester\u2019s worth of information, and I literally taught it over a semester at the University of Texas. So I know it can take a long time if you want it to. But I did these seminars in two days, and it was eight hours a day, two days. These people are paying me a lot of money and so they\u2019re very motivated to learn. And amazingly, they got almost all of it in two days! Which was amazing to me that they could! But that\u2019s the power of human effort, and that\u2019s the power of desire and things like that! And I look at the education system today and I\u2019m like, This is completely broken! Because if these people can learn in two days what took me really like a couple of years \u2014 the education system is what is wrong! They\u2019re not properly motivated, or it\u2019s not presented the right way, or whatever. There\u2019s plenty of really smart people that can get things really, really quickly! And I\u2019m sure you know of coding boot camps and things like that? It\u2019s six weeks and then they come out of it paid six-figures at a pretty decent company. That\u2019s the path that they\u2019re on, and six weeks of training is all that they need to get to that point where they can do something like that! That\u2019s the first thing that I learned, is that people are very willing to learn if they are motivated to do so! The other thing that I learned is that there\u2019s a lot of people that get motivated by other people. I have pretty much the same material in my book, and you can definitely work through it. The typical length of time it takes for somebody to actually work through the entire book with all of the exercises and everything is a few months. But I\u2019m able to do this in two days! Part of it is me pushing them. Just, I\u2019m gonna go fast and you better keep up, otherwise you\u2019re not gonna get value out of it. But the other part of it is that, there\u2019s sort of like what I would call the CrossFit effect \u2014 if you\u2019ve ever been in CrossFit, just the fact that somebody next to you is doing reps that you\u2019re not doing makes you feel terrible! And that motivates you to do the reps, even if you don\u2019t feel like it! And that\u2019s the dynamic in a classroom that I realized really works in everyone\u2019s favor. When you have competition and this sense of keeping up, it can be a very powerful force for learning. So those would be the two things that I\u2019d say I learned about.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [34:40]: What kind of people self-select into a Programming for Bitcoin course? And are they programmers of other sorts, or are they people who are coming to Bitcoin fresh and want a way in?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: I had a lot of different types of students. The people that I expected were professional programmers that wanted to know about Bitcoin so they could get a job in the Bitcoin industry. So I certainly got some of those. I also got programmers that were sent by companies because they wanted to have some sort of strategy for Bitcoin or blockchain or whatever and they sent them to my course. Alright, I\u2019ll teach them, and then they went back. I also had a bunch of Bitcoin HODLers that knew a little bit about programming that wanted to learn more about the protocol so they could learn more about their investment. I had college students, and I had octogenarians! I had people all over the spectrum. I actually had a few high school students. In fact, I had a 14-year-old girl that won a scholarship \u2014 so pretty smart girl \u2014 that managed to take the course and keep up with the rest of the class, which absolutely shocked me! It was a whole variety of people and they all had different motivations. This was something that\u2014as a small business person you realize \u2014 is that, the market\u2019s gonna come from places to you do not expect. And it\u2019s very important that you pay attention to those things, because if you do then you\u2019ll be able to better serve the market and be able to make more money.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [36:31]: Some of your students have gone on to do amazing things in the Bitcoin space! Do you ever pick up something very quickly about students as you\u2019re teaching them. You maybe sense who\u2019s picking it up or who\u2019s getting it? And this question is kind of phrased in two ways: how much of coding \u2014 whether someone\u2019s in your course \u2014 how much of it is art versus science? Or a combination, and some people are better at one or the other? Like I could write code and get what you need done, versus maybe Satoshi \u2014 and I\u2019m trying to paraphrase what you wrote \u2014 wasn\u2019t the best coder ever? But if you look at all the ideas that were intertwined, and the multi-disciplinary background to pull all this together, you would think that the art is unreal!"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: As far as identifying my students, you can always tell as an educator something about the student by the quality of the questions that they ask. Once in a while you\u2019ll just see a student that\u2019s asking these very precise questions, and you\u2019re like, Okay! That person is going places! If they\u2019re asking that, that means they know all of this other stuff. And they have a grasp of it that\u2019s even better than mine. There\u2019s certainly those one-off geniuses that you encounter in class \u2014 every educator has met them! And you can always tell, usually by the quality of the question. But there are also others that are more silent and introverted and they get it, but you never identify it until much later. And that I usually find out by what happens afterwards! What companies they get hired by and so on. I think I have students at pretty much every major Bitcoin company that exists! Like, they clearly know something and can do things that I didn\u2019t identify while I was teaching them. There is a lot of that. I would say that the creativity, the art of it, comes from understanding. I think Satoshi could have written a better client, if Satoshi had more programming experience. But the fact that Satoshi got so much of it right is actually more impressive than the parts that he got wrong, because those are sort of the mistakes that you would expect somebody that wasn\u2019t quite as familiar with what you would call enterprise-grade coding, or open source level coding, that you expect from the bigger projects and so on. So I think they\u2019re both very related. It\u2019s great to see \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I call them my kids too \u2014 when your kids do something really cool.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [39:43]: I listened to a lot of what you spoke about \u2014 let\u2019s call them shitcoins or altcoins \u2014 and the bets you\u2019ve made. And one thing that you said throughout the conversations that I\u2019ve heard is, you\u2019re not really looking to deify Satoshi. I thought that was really interesting grounding. Satoshi leaving the project\u2014is that sort of like on a deification level?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: I don\u2019t know! That might be true. What I can say is that the current state of affairs \u2014 what has happened \u2014 has worked out for the best of Bitcoin. I think that\u2019s worthy of some consideration in Satoshi\u2019s favor.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [42:19]: It\u2019s 2020. We\u2019ve been through a bunch of Bitcoin cycles. A few to be a little more specific. You\u2019re one of the few sane Bitcoin OGs! Still grounded and still very focused on Bitcoin!"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: I wouldn\u2019t say that! I think there\u2019s plenty of people in the Bitcoin Core development world that came in before me that are still around, that are doing a lot of good things. What I have noticed is that a lot of the non-technical OGs \u2014 almost all of them \u2014 have more or less left Bitcoin for something else. Usually an altcoin. And completely burned their reputations on them, which is kind of sad! I think the one OG that\u2019s not like that is maybe Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert, but that\u2019s about it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [43:16]: Wow. Do you think there\u2019s something to that? In terms of being able to make money, or counterfeit money? Or that power that they\u2019ve sensed. Or that metaphor of grabbing the throne?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: I think it is something like that, but if you come at the King, you best not miss. That\u2019s more of less what they\u2019ve tried to do. A lot of the non-technical OGs came in from sort of an investment standpoint, not as sort of like changing the story of the store of value, or something like that. They instead came in thinking, Oh this is a good investment! I picked the winner! I\u2019m going to be able to pick other winners. They get kind of an ego about it. And I think that\u2019s where their downfall is, in thinking that they are bigger than Bitcoin itself. We\u2019ve seen this happen over and over and over again with all of these would-be saviors that are creating their own coin and saying, This is the new thing. We\u2019re going to be Facebook to Bitcoin\u2019s Myspace. Bitcoin is the Model T and I\u2019m a Lambroghini. These are all arguments by analogy and so on. Ultimately, they believe that they can do better than Satoshi did. And that\u2019s the fatal flaw to a large degree. Because the biggest thing that Satoshi did was leave! And give up the throne, if you will. And that\u2019s something these guys aren\u2019t willing to do. In that sense it\u2019s a sad commentary on their motivations. They end up there because \u2014 if you\u2019re an investor and you make a lot of money, you\u2019re going to have an ego. That\u2019s just a fact. That\u2019s how you keep score in that world. For a technical person it\u2019s not quite like that. You keep score a different way so you\u2019re not as susceptible to that particular thing, so I suspect that\u2019s why programmers haven\u2019t been as susceptible to that as non-technical OGs have.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [45:50]: I like how you swept a lot of that argument away, or that civil war with, You know hard forks are great, it proves that Bitcoin\u2019s a voluntary system. And you\u2019re free to go! I think that summed that up for me very nicely. I like that a lot. I want to turn to, what do you think is going on in 2020?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Well 2020 has been a crazy year. I don\u2019t need to tell any of your listeners that. From a Bitcoin standpoint, Bitcoin crashed with the market, and then it recovered way faster! And the market\u2019s been recovering really fast, so it\u2019s even faster than that. So it\u2019s been kind of a crazy year. I would say the halving was the big event that happened in May, and that was something that everyone anticipated, but the supply shock that came as a result of that hasn\u2019t really worked itself through the market, until about now. It\u2019s starting to be felt. You can see the price rising and so on. That\u2019s definitely something that\u2019s happening. Will it continue down this road and will it end I\u2019m not really sure. It does seem like there\u2019s less of a supply of Bitcoin and a heck of a lot of demand. We know that once it gets to be a frenzy it can go up really fast. That\u2019s what I\u2019m anticipating is, from a store of value standpoint, a lot more people are going to be adopting it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [47:35]: You made some predictions on Twitter for 2020! You said Bitcoin dominance at 75% at the end of the year. We\u2019re edging towards that. Taproot will be activated without much controversy \u2014 I think that sounds like a slam dunk. Bitcoin price will have a bottom to top difference of at least 100% where we got that in multiples, and halving will be the big narrative. Do you have any predictions for 2021?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Well I was wrong on the first two I think. It said 65% and I didn\u2019t anticipate all of these DeFi coins coming in, and they diluted the dominance index significantly because there were just so many of them. And Taproot looks like it won\u2019t be activated until next year so I was wrong about that. I expected it to be activated this year which it definitely won\u2019t be. 2021 I\u2019m expecting Taproot to get activated. I suspect that wallets will have a little bit of a hard time implementing all of the goodies that come out of Taproot: Schnorr signatures, aggregated multisig, MuSig and things like that. Those are not that simple, let\u2019s just say that from a technical standpoint. And there\u2019s lot of gotchas, a lot of wallet developers \u2014 they do put in a lot of time into their product, but they\u2019re also putting a lot of time into altcoins and things like that. If you want to adopt Schnorr and things, you\u2019re going to really need to focus on Schnorr and not be developing altcoin number 95 or whatever into your product. I see some tension around wallets and Schnorr and adoption and things like that. I think the industry will be adopting it, it\u2019s just a matter of time. Other things: I see the uncertainty continuing from 2020. I know that\u2019s probably not what a lot of people want to hear. That seems to be the case right now. There is a lot of uncertainty around elections and COVID and things like that. If anything, this seems to be \u2014 I hate this phrase \u2014 but the new normal. In a sense all of that is kind of good for Bitcoin, because it\u2019s the one thing that looks much more stable than everything else, and in my opinion it is more stable than everything else, in a different kind of way.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [50:40]: How do you think the new normal is affecting us? How is it affecting your kids?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Well thankfully they\u2019re actually physically going to school, so they\u2019re having a little bit more normal time than I think other kids are. But, oh man, I\u2019m married so it\u2019s not as bad. And I have kids so I get to hang out with them and whatever. But if I were a single person living in a major city I can\u2019t imagine how different life would be for me right now. There\u2019s just nowhere to go out. It\u2019s hard to meet people, and people are all scared and everything else! And if you\u2019re in college or something like that, the campus experience is just completely changed. If you\u2019re in high school, your school experience is very different. Even the people come out of college, they\u2019re coming into a work environment that\u2019s just completely different than what anyone else has had in the past 30 years! The social impact of what\u2019s happened is something that\u2019s going to be felt for a pretty long time. And a lot of it\u2019s going to be permanent, because Google, Twitter, Facebook, they\u2019re all like letting their employees work remotely for at least a year and so on. That\u2019s definitely going to become more normal. There\u2019s probably a lot of other things happening, and who knows what other virus might spark the public imagination in the next 18 months. So all of that is to say, there\u2019s a definite shift in mentality among the populous, so I expect that to have some downstream second order effects, at least.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [52:38]: Sure. You have traveled and lived in a lot of places. You could live anywhere. Why Texas? Should I move to Texas? I\u2019m visiting in a week and a half for Gery Leland\u2019s Dallas BitBlockBoom Barbeque. I\u2019m so excited. What\u2019s with Texas?"}
{"prompt": "Jimmy Song: Yeah! Texas is awesome! First thing, if you\u2019re a US citizen is no state income tax! That\u2019s a major one if you make any money at all, as opposed to like California which can be upwards of 10% just in terms of income taxes. That\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s also a culture of more free and libertarian thinking, which I like. Which is very different than the coasts which tend to be a lot more nanny statish. I rather have my freedom. It\u2019s a very good cost of living versus what you can make ratio, which is kind of what you want! In San Francisco, you can make a lot of money, but it also costs you an arm and a leg to live there. Kansas City is a very nice place to live but you don\u2019t have that many jobs that pay that well. So you want some combination of both.

What brought you here today?"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [03:20]: A whole lot of stuff! I used to read a lot of Slashdot, which is \u2014 News for Nerds was their slogan. All the developers in the 90\u2019s, the Internet geeks, this was really where all these guys hung out. And I knew about Bitcoin essentially 2011, and I read a little bit about it, and I certainly didn\u2019t grok it, but I did kind of understand that it was this anonymous Internet money. And that people were using it to buy drugs and stuff. It was interesting! But I didn\u2019t quite get it. And then, somewhere around 2013\u20132014 I was like, People are still buying drugs on the Internet with this stuff! And I tried to go on Mt. Gox and I got into the log-in, and I started to create an account, and they asked for my ID, and I was like, Oh, I thought this was an anonymous Internet currency? So I was like, Well this won\u2019t do! So I closed that window, did a little more research, and was like, Oh! An ATM! As long as it doesn\u2019t have a camera, I can obscure my face and I can get some anonymous Internet money! That\u2019s cool! So I just kind of waited, and I always looked around for them, but I guess I kind of forgot about it for a few years. I\u2019d see it come up on TV and stuff, and then 2017 \u2014 big price, the hype, right? \u2014 I was like, You know what? I\u2019m gonna take another look at this. And like many among us, I fell into the Andreas Antonopoulos rabbit hole videos, and started going pretty deep. I watched probably like a hundred of those. And then I was just like looking around for more information, I was on Reddit a bunch, and eventually I saw that you gotta get on Twitter, if you\u2019re gonna be in the Bitcoin universe! [05:05] I did that, and then I got into Austrian economics.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: So I have some questions there, like, You mentioned Andreas, and I think a lot of people start out in crypto listening to Andreas Antonopoulos but clearly \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say that you evolved \u2014 but maybe you moved on to something a little bit more mature than that? Like, can you tell me what that process was like for you? How did you go from listening to Andreas to Austrian economics? Because to me that\u2019s a little bit of a leap. I don\u2019t really consider him like an Austrian guy."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Yeah I know! But there was this really intelligent guy who, he\u2019s just like in the finance world in the U.K. or something, and he kept going back to this deflationary argument. And I realized I didn\u2019t understand enough about the economics, and that was just about the time I was getting onto Twitter, and eventually found people like Pierre Rochard, and kept hearing about Austrian economics. I think I followed Justin Moon, he runs BUIDL Bootcamp. He teaches people how to code Bitcoin, so he put this thing out saying, I\u2019m doing an Austrian economics book club \u2014 who\u2019s in? I was just like, Oh, sure! Me! Then I met Max Hillebrand, who\u2019s amazing. I met Zane Pocock, who\u2019s really awesome if you guys don\u2019t know Zane, and I met Thibaud Mar\u00e9chal. Almost every week, we discuss Austrian economics in the paradigm of the Bitcoin world, and my knowledge has just skyrocketed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [06:45]: Yeah it\u2019s really interesting, because my turning point in my \u201ccrypto\u201d career was really similar. I was on, I think it was Reddit, and as much shit as I give Reddit, I have learned a lot from Reddit over the years, and I hate Reddit and I don\u2019t go on it these days. And I think I remember coming across a post, and it was basically like, How do I sort through all this noise? There is so much noise in crypto! This was like, early 2017, late 2016, like height of the frenzy, and somebody asked the question and was like How do I sort through all this noise? Somebody was like, Alright. What you need to do is you need to make a Twitter \u2014 and I already had a Twitter but I had only used it for like trading penny stocks, just to follow companies and P/Es and stuff \u2014 he said, Follow the people that have been in this space a really long time, cultivate a really careful Twitter feed of people that are either developers, that have been in this space a really long time and are smart and only talk about smart stuff, and then he had a list of all of his recommended people, and a lot of them were people I still follow today like Kyle Torpey, Pierre Rochard \u2014 some of them I have ended up muting, blocking, whatever. Guys like Vinny Lingham, like \u2014 get him away from me! But, yeah I had a really similar journey! And Twitter, for me, was a huge part in shaping my understanding and my thought process, and finding my gaps in my knowledge. You know what I mean?"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [08:09]: Yes! And I think this brings me to: I think one of the most important things you need to understand about this universe is that critical thinking is so paramount! Especially in the fake news era, but it always is. So if you guys aren\u2019t familiar with critical thinking, it\u2019s a very simple discipline that is quintessential to incorporating new information into your worldview. And it talks about (1) avoiding logical fallacies. So, in order to do that you need to understand logic and you need to understand what logical fallacies are and how they lead you to the incorrect conclusions and think you\u2019re correct. (2) Second thing is, absorb information from many different sources, and decide based on the validity of the arguments therein, whether or not this information is good. You may not know whether it\u2019s true or not, but how good is it? And you incorporate lots of information and they all kind of have a scale of how good they are. And on Twitter, you\u2019re not getting information from CNN or FOX News, it\u2019s from all these random people, and you just have to evaluate the information based on what it is. [09:18] In doing that, that\u2019s how you cultivate your Twitter following, like you said. You followed people, and then you unfollowed them when you realized that what they were saying wasn\u2019t prescient, or wasn\u2019t logically sound. And if you work from this foundation, then you can get to a place that\u2019s close to truth \u2014 and I use that word very loosely.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [09:40]: Yeah and I think I would add to that, in regards to the critical thinking piece: everybody has a bias, and I think that we\u2019re \u2014 at least I was when growing up \u2014 under this false pretense that bias is bad, and you need to go to sources that don\u2019t have bias. But that\u2019s inherently impossible! Because everybody\u2019s biased in some way, shape, or form. And just because a person is biased, doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re wrong! Somebody can be extremely \u2014 me, for example, I\u2019m probably very biased for Bitcoin. But that\u2019s also because I\u2019ve done probably, at this point, hundreds if not a thousand-plus hours of research on this topic. And I am thoroughly and logically convinced through my steps through this process, through this Bitcoin spectrum \u2014 as we\u2019re gonna go over and talk about today \u2014 that I\u2019ve come to the correct conclusions, or at least I\u2019ve surrounded myself with enough smart people that they would weed out my bullshit. You know, where I would be wrong. Like, Twitter is such an amazing resource. If you cultivate, carefully, a good following, and you block people liberally who interrupt your intellectual process, it can be a really, really great place to learn! So, I want to jump into this Bitcoin spectrum. Now, this is something that you share with me \u2014 this was published by Unchained Capital, I\u2019m gonna have a link to this picture down in the show notes if you guys want to check it out, if you want to follow along visually if you\u2019re a visual learner (I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re listening to a podcast, but\u2026). If you want to follow along as we talk through this, but we want to try to hit some of the major points, because something Ben and I talked a lot about is how the Bitcoin and the blockchain spectrum is massive in scope, and if you have missing pieces, it\u2019s kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, right? If you have missing pieces on this Bitcoin spectrum, you\u2019re not gonna be able to see the whole picture, and you\u2019re really not going to be able to understand why this thing is so important, and why it\u2019s so valuable, unless you can see the big picture! Ben, do you have any thoughts on that?"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [11:39]: Yeah. So the spectrum \u2014 in case people aren\u2019t looking at the thing \u2014 it\u2019s four main pillars. And I don\u2019t think this graph is necessarily the end-all. It\u2019s a Venn-diagram, right? It has four main pillars, four main schools of thought, and I don\u2019t think this is the end-all, be-all of what describes Bitcoin, but it\u2019s a great start to understand how complex this topic is. There are four main bubbles on this Venn-diagram: Politics, Economics, Distributed Systems, Cryptography. Really, each one of these things are very difficult to understand wholisticly \u2014 really understand them. And what we\u2019re trying to do, to understand Bitcoin, is to understand all four of these things and how they interact. And then, try to understand the paradigm of a new world with Bitcoin in it! And then understand all of those disciplines in this new paradigm, this unknown future that is in front of us. And that is a very difficult task to do I think. That\u2019s why all of us spend all this time researching and discussing and eliminating bad ideas! Right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [12:50]: Yeah. It\u2019s important to try to take a very praxeological approach to this spectrum in understanding that there aren\u2019t really any hard and fast rules here. All we can really do is observe human action, try to anticipate the way that we think this is gonna play out, and that\u2019s where the whole game theory thing comes into it. And look at each spectrum as broadly as possible, and then dig as deeply into Bitcoin as we can, and try to understand where we think this thing is gonna go! And I think that that\u2019s what a lot of really smart people have done. And yeah, Ben, you and I have been talking about this just the other day, I feel like the smartest people in cryptocurrency \u2014 and if you\u2019re listening to this and you\u2019re not that into Bitcoin, you know, welcome to the show \u2014 but, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s just the honest truth! I\u2019m not sorry! The smartest people in this space have all come to the same conclusion independently."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [13:44]: Yeah, and I see that over and over again. I will come to a thought independently, post it on Twitter and see somebody else later that had already wrote it! Or, I\u2019ll post it first, and I\u2019ll see Andreas say something like that, and it\u2019s incredible that we\u2019re individually all coming to the same conclusions. And one of those conclusions \u2014 the Schelling point, as Marty Bent talks about \u2014 is Bitcoin itself being really, really, a whole lot farther ahead than all the other ones. Really has a much better chance of doing what we\u2019re talking about. Where it\u2019s taking over a large swathe of the money that we transact on the Internet.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [14:23]: So let\u2019s take a look at this spectrum. In case you guys missed it, the four pillars are Politics, Economics, Distributed Systems, and Cryptography. So we\u2019re gonna start, and we\u2019re gonna talk about the economics first. We\u2019re gonna touch on some of the points there. And then we\u2019re gonna make our way through the other pillars to give you a broad overview of all of the things that go into this system. So first and foremost we have the economics piece. Ben, what are your initial thoughts when you think of the economics?"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Well I encourage everyone to really dive into the Austrian economics here because, as Collin was asking me, like How did I get into the economics side of it? Well, I got into it because I was trying to argue with people and I realized that I didn\u2019t have the knowledge. I didn\u2019t understand inflationary versus deflationary. And that\u2019s really a small piece of this, once you start getting deep into this! I think Hazlitt and Bastiat \u2014 Henry Hazlitt\u2019s the one who wrote Economics In One Lesson \u2014 incredible read, talks about a fallacy, right? So I was talking about logical fallacies before. He talks about the fallacy of the broken window. [15:32] So really simply, if you\u2019re not familiar with it, it\u2019s the idea that somebody has a shop. And the window gets broken in the shop, and that this creates economic activity and it\u2019s good for the economy, because the guy comes and sweeps up the street and he gets paid, and the glazier \u2014 the guy who makes glass \u2014 has to create a glass window, and the people who supply him with glass stock, and the people who supply him with tools to do all that, all get economic transactions out of this! So you\u2019ve created economy activity! But the fallacy is that: well, yeah, but the shop owner has to take money that he could have spent elsewhere. He could have spent it on a new pair of shoes, and \u2014 you never see those things, right? So this is the effects of that shop owner not being able to spend money on his new pair of shoes or his new suit or something \u2014 [they] are never seen, and they\u2019re obscured, and they\u2019re ignored. This happens everywhere in the economy, and if you have the government saying, Oh, well we\u2019re gonna build this thing! And, Yes, that creates economic activity, but this is like a zero-sum game, essentially. That, if you create money to pay for something, then you have diluted the supply of all the money, and you\u2019ve taken away purchasing power from everybody, and the investments that never happened, or the things that we couldn\u2019t buy because our money was worth a little bit less, are never seen. So this is a really crucial thing to understand, I think! I can keep going here, economics is so deep into this, right? Because money itself and commerce are so tied into economics, and we\u2019re talking about a digital money that is brand new, so you have to understand money! I don\u2019t think anybody really understands money!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [17:38]: Yeah! That\u2019s actually a really great point if I could stop you for a second! I know for me personally, and I went to public school \u2014 I know Ben\u2019s situation is a little bit different, but, growing up I took several economics courses, probably in high school and then maybe in my undergrad also, and I had never been exposed \u2014 you know, I had heard the name F. A. Hayek, but probably in name only in mentions like in passing them off, in the same way that you would read a psychology textbook and read about Freud and be like, That guy with those crazy theories that we don\u2019t really believe anymore. That\u2019s the way that Austrian economics is presented to the modern scholar. And I\u2019m sorry (I keep saying sorry. I\u2019m not sorry) we\u2019ll bring it back to the critical thinking piece from earlier\u2014you have to examine these things for yourself! And decide whether or not they\u2019re worthy of value. And if you haven\u2019t been exposed to Austrian economics then you are not in a position to decide whether or not that\u2019s a valid argument to be made, whether or not that\u2019s a valid theory! So if you\u2019re listening to this and you think, Oh, Austrian economics is bunk! It\u2019s been bunk for years and years and years ever since modern money theory! Ever since Keynesian economics! You need to revisit that. You need to go and learn a lot more about money! Where is it? Where does it come from?"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [18:59]: Yeah and I would actually go a step further because as Hazlitt said in the book I talked about, Economics in One Lesson, he actually goes into it and talks about that fallacy, but he actually goes on to say that there\u2019s a network of fallacies that obscure the truth! That you\u2019re required to fall into this network of fallacies in order to understand Keynesianism. So essentially, what I\u2019m trying to say really, really convolutedly, is that: Austrian economics breaks the fallacies that are the arguments that Keynesianism makes. And Keynesianism is the main school of thought in economics! Essentially, that governments should interfere in markets. And really, Austrian economics is really just exposing the fallacies therein! And that\u2019s why we don\u2019t even really spend time [on it]\u2014 because Keynesianism is just a bunch of equations and trying to manipulate the markets to your whim. And the thing you realize about markets and supply and demand is that the more you manipulate them the more they push back! But I really want to get into this forgotten history of money. If you don\u2019t understand the history of money, or what money is, or what problem it solves, how could you understand whether or not Bitcoin is money, or is good money, or is bad money? It\u2019s really not possible, and it\u2019s really enlightening, and that goes into \u2014 if you guys haven\u2019t read The Bitcoin Standard \u2014 incredible book that talks about the history of money and how so many great societies fell because of poor money. And a lot of it had to do with inflation. And inflation comes in many forms, but many years ago when there were gold coins or other metals used, they used debasement to inflate the currency. Which meant that they would take all the coins back, or they would collect some of them, and they would return coins out into circulation that had less of that metal in them. That was very laborious to do, it took a lot of work, you had to create all these new coins \u2014 it still had issues, and it was easy to verify! Like if you take this thing and melt it down and you find out there\u2019s less gold in it, then you could find out that the government was debasing your currency! And inflation happened much less than it happened now back then. For these reasons, because it was so hard to do.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [21:27]: Right. But they didn\u2019t even call it inflation back then. Nobody was trying to pass it off as a good thing! Everyone knew it was just the king stealing a little bit of extra gold to line his coffers."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Right! The king would be hiding this! And he would be caught red-handed and blushing if people caught him doing this. Now, not only in the modern day has Keynesianism convinced us that inflation is necessary, but it is so much easier to inflate now. It literally costs them almost nothing! [In] a keystroke, they can create new digital entries at the Federal Reserve, and create new money! And that\u2019s what they did in 2008 when they created many trillions of dollars. Since then, another $10 trillion has been added to the money supply \u2014 it\u2019s insane! And this is all because it\u2019s now easier to inflate, and it\u2019s impossible to verify whether or not they\u2019re inflating or not! They can just print and print and print! And that\u2019s what happened in Zimbabwe and Venezuela.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [22:28]: Right. And we could go really deep on this. We could talk about this for hours and hours and hours, and many people have! And there\u2019s still a lot more to unpack. We still haven\u2019t yet fully begun to understand the economic implications of Bitcoin, because it\u2019s the first time that we\u2019ve ever really been able to push back on the free market, on this ideology, because it affords so much power to the centralized authorities: the ability to create credit and to harvest wealth through seigniorage rights. It is what has financed the world wars that we saw in the previous century. And it was unprecedented prior to that, when, in Democracy: The God That Failed, Hans Herman Hoppe, talks about how, back when private property was the norm\u2014when that was just the expectation across the board \u2014 and kings had to represent their own private best interests by engaging in armed conflict, they couldn\u2019t afford to indebt themselves indefinitely in order to fight these extremely large, expense, bloody battles, because it was impossible! They didn\u2019t have a way to pay for it. So yeah the rabbit hole goes pretty deep there."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [23:46]: Yeah because through inflation, they\u2019ve now extended their war treasure chest to the wealth of all of the citizens that hold their money. I think that\u2019s a Saifedean kind of quote there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: And I will say real quick \u2014 we\u2019re about to shift topics here. Anytime you\u2019re going through this Bitcoin spectrum here, or if you\u2019re just reading posts on Twitter and you\u2019re just trying to learn more about Bitcoin, anytime you come across any concept that you don\u2019t understand, or even if you\u2019re not 100% clear of what that is, you should take that as a learning opportunity. And you should go and you should educate yourself on that matter. Most of the time it\u2019s just a Google search away. Like if you don\u2019t know what Supply and Demand actually means, if you\u2019ve heard that in school and you don\u2019t remember what it mean, type it into Google, go to Investopedia or whatever, and just look it up! And now you\u2019re clear, because I think I see a lot of people do this, where they\u2019re participating in an argument and they don\u2019t understand what\u2019s even being discussed. But they\u2019re still arguing, even though they don\u2019t understand the concepts that are being discussed? And that really makes you look like a fool. So don\u2019t be a fool. Make sure that you understand these concepts, and if you don\u2019t understand something, jump into it. But, anyway, it\u2019s not just the economics piece. Economics sort of has an overlap with politics. It\u2019s not enough to know about just sound money, and about supply and demand, and about scarcity. You\u2019ve also got markets. You have to understand the way markets work, regulation, monetary policy, global banking, national security. Ben you want to touch on any of those?"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [25:15]: Yeah. I think this one, it\u2019s tough to talk about on its own, because I plan to show how these things overlap. But democracies and communities are on the politics spectrum. Democracy has been kind of \u2014 started to be infected through socialism. And a lot of people today throw that word around without really understanding what it means. Socialism is, by a simple definition, government owning the means of production. But I came across a Tweet recently that said, Japan\u2019s central bank has become a top 10 shareholder in 50% of the companies there. So what do I mean by that? I mean that literally the central bank has bought stocks from all of these companies. A top 10 shareholder in 50% of the companies in Japan! And it\u2019s a similar story here! I don\u2019t know the numbers on here, but the government, in open market operations, is buying stocks to support asset prices. This is what happened in 2008. They\u2019re also, through their policy, through low interest rates, they\u2019re throwing money on assets, but \u2014 we\u2019ll get into that in a second I think, but \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [26:44]: And just to clarify, I just looked into this really recently: the Federal Reserve doesn\u2019t actually own any equities, but like Ben is saying, they do actually buy the assets that can inflate the underlying equities, because they inflate the value of the equities. And another really similar thing is going on in Switzerland. The Swiss national bank owns\u2014something like 10% of their balance sheet is international equity, and I believe half of that is actually US equity. Imagine the moral hazard of being able to print money at will, and then use that money to buy money share off of the global equities market. There\u2019s a huge incentive for malice there."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Yeah it\u2019s on my list too. But you know, there\u2019s this concept in Bitcoin of self-sovereignty, right? So sovereignty is the idea that a nation controls itself. It\u2019s like an independence. Self-sovereignty is like being independent of the government, I think. And really in this current landscape \u2014 and after learning about a lot of these concepts \u2014 essentially, the government is stealing our wealth through inflation, they\u2019re manipulating markets, and they\u2019re really messing with all economics! And really the free market is dying! And people are point to now capitalism and saying, Oh, capitalism isn\u2019t working! Well, it\u2019s not capitalism when the government is literally manipulating all of the markets! Price signals are developed \u2014 so you can see how these things are overlapping, I can\u2019t even talk about politics without talking about economics, but\u2014 free markets are the idea that, you know, I put up a good at whatever price that it took me to produce it plus a little bit of premium from my work that I\u2019ve put into it, and when the government is changing the value of the money by diluting the supply and, in many other ways, manipulating these markets \u2014 and by the way, they\u2019re doing this openly and saying that this is the Federal policies! Their mandate is to ensure low unemployment and to keep inflation\u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [29:14]: Inject liquidity and manage inflation. And another thing too, you know, if you want to see\u2014you can go and look at the balance sheet, for the Federal Reserve! And you can go look for yourself: every single dollar, where they have it allocated, what they have it allocated to, they publish it every single year. And it\u2019s kind of frankly very disturbing, and that doesn\u2019t even get into the unfunded liabilities that we have in America. The debt is actually much much much much higher than just the national debt ticker that you can type into Google and see. It\u2019s actually in the hundreds of trillions. You can compare all of our social safety net and socialist economic fallback plans that we have \u2014 you know, even FDIC, the bank insurance, which \u2014 we can get into that, that\u2019s a whole other can of worms!"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: I have a really simple soundbite on that! The lenders of last resort create moral hazard by shifting the risks from markets to the lender of last resort. And the lender of last resort is the central bank, and the central bank\u2019s response to these events is to create money! So actually the risk is shifted to everybody! So that\u2019s what we mean by socialism, right? So social policy \u2014 you\u2019re talking about Social Security and Medicare which are essentially ponzi schemes which are falling apart now \u2014 we\u2019re realizing that they\u2019re gonna be unfunded! But all of these social policies \u2014 yeah. It\u2019s not straight socialism, the government doesn\u2019t own Amazon and Microsoft and Ford, but they are slowly usurping power and inserting themselves into, it seems, every facet of the market!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [31:07]: Yeah. And we\u2019re not just making this stuff up. You know, there\u2019s already historical precedent for this. Just 2008 is actually a great example. You see the real estate bubble, and most people don\u2019t understand why it happened. They think that it was because the average investor thought that they could get rich quick, and that they were going out and taking out too many mortgages, and yeah, that\u2019s part of the problem, but the real problem was that credit was so easy to get, and there was so much incentive\u2014because of all the mortage-backed securities, no risk, and money that was being funneled into Fannie Mae and Freddy Mac \u2014 and this was all through the government, right? And this disrupts the normal actions of the free market. Normally, you have the benefits, and then you have the fall backs. You get to reap the rewards, but you also have to deal with the risks, deal with the fallout afterwards. And there was so much going on there, there was so much inter-breeding of government and free market there that it was what led to the bubble and caused the ultimate fallout."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Oh! This is exactly what this is, right? So the government is throwing money on the assets that rich hold, while the poor are left holding money. So they\u2019re inflating the money, they\u2019re stealing the wealth \u2014 because government can print pieces of paper, but they can\u2019t create wealth out of thin air \u2014 so they are robbing wealth from everybody by diluting the supply of money, and they\u2019re dumping it on assets.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Your piece of the pie just gets smaller, if they\u2019re not creating any more pie."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Yeah, exactly! And they\u2019re taking that wealth that they\u2019re robbing from people that hold cash, and dumping it on assets and real estate, which the rich hold a larger percentage of as their wealth! So that\u2019s socialism for the rich! The rich are getting bailed out every year, while the poor are struggling to get social programs to try to help them survive. And that\u2019s they where the turmoil you\u2019re seeing right now in the country is, that\u2019s why people are begging for more socialism. Because only the rich are getting it, and they don\u2019t realize that!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [35:47]: Yeah and if you\u2019re privy to the information of the few men in the world who hold the keys to the kill switch of the economy\u2014the ones who determine the monetary policy \u2014you can make decisions when you\u2019re privy to that information prior to those things happening, and you stand to profit. I mean, that\u2019s why you see the central banks move larger allocations into gold before they start to tighten their monetary policy, because they know that those assets are gonna come back down to more reasonable levels in value. And they\u2019re storing their wealth in between changes in monetary policy, but if you\u2019re not privy to that information before it happens, you\u2019re gonna be playing catch-up. You\u2019re gonna be trying not to lose."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Thank you. And math, right? So math and provability and verifiability and how, if you tell some random Joe who has no math on the street about, Oh no no! This is all verifiable! He either won\u2019t trust you or he\u2019ll have to trust you, right? If he doesn\u2019t understand these concepts intrinsically. And you get into cryptographic security of the protocols, and cryptographic security of your wallet, right? Like, can somebody just guess my Bitcoin key? Because then you just generate one. Understanding that it takes a thousand Earth\u2019s worth of computing power to guess the key to your wallet. And then the quantum cryptography \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Yeah if you don\u2019t understand logarithmic math, it might be really easy to think that Bitcoin is not that secure."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [37:35]: And then understanding security of the blockchain, and how it takes \u2014 how much energy you would need to input to recreate the blockchain and to change the history. Or even to write a new transaction, or to double-spend. And this gets me into why Bitcoin is better than all the other cryptocurrencies \u2014 probably combined! Because it has ten times the users and ten times the hashrate of all these things combined! You could turn off 10% of the supply of Bitcoin miners and point them at Bitcoin Cash, for example, and 51% attack it with ease! And one of these large Bitcoin mining pools could probably do that with ease, right now, and then go back to mining Bitcoin afterward! They could crash Bitcoin Cash if they really wanted to! That\u2019s not possible with Bitcoin. So you see a lot of Bitcoin maximalists very ardent that Bitcoin is way, way better. You have to understand all of these things together, and then you have to start to understand the economics and networks. So Metcalfe\u2019s law, network effects, and how much larger the network of Bitcoin is, and how much more people know about Bitcoin and use Bitcoin. And where it\u2019s accepted, if you want to go that route. How much further ahead it is. I also wanted to get into how cryptography and distributed systems \u2014 specifically BitTorrent. If you guys don\u2019t remember, in the 90\u2019s there was Napster. Napster was where you could download songs for free. I remember showing this to my friends and they were like, Wow! You can download any song for free? And I was like, Yep! Right there! Check it out! And it was shut down. And then there was Morpheus and Limewire and all these other services came out after it and those were all shut down too. [39:17] And then somebody came along and made this thing called BitTorrent. And the governments were like, Huh! There\u2019s really no way to shut this down! It\u2019s a peer to peer network! You\u2019d have to go down to every single person\u2019s house and shut them all off. And BitTorrent opened the door to a system that could never be turned off. And that kind of goes into the decentralization of Bitcoin, why decentralization is so important, and why Bitcoiners are small blockers, versus the big block Bitcoin Cash people. The decentralization of the network is paramount! It\u2019s the most important thing! If you do not have this decentralization, it will get shut down! We know, because all of the other sovereign monies that were tried outside of the government all got shut down. From Liberty Dollar to real meatspace stuff to BCash and BitGold. There was a number of digital currencies started and eventually the government just shows up and knocks on the door and says, Yeah you guys gotta turn this stuff of. The decentralization of Bitcoin, plus solving the double-spend problem, is what makes it resilient to this. Its antifragility. And if you don\u2019t understand that concept you\u2019re not gonna understand why Bitcoiners think that it\u2019s better than all the other cryptocurrencies. And while we\u2019re on distributed systems and open source software, you get into network architecture. The network architecture of the Internet is built with Internet Protocol first, then its TCP/IP, and then later they built all these other layers on top of that: HTTPS \u2014 and those things don\u2019t change, right? So IP, TCP \u2014 we\u2019re not changing those protocols. Another good example is e-mail, the POP and IMAP, haven\u2019t changed in 20 or 30 years! You know, there\u2019s no read receipts, there\u2019s no undo button, and there\u2019s a number of features that we could add if we could change the protocols underlying these things, but they don\u2019t change. And there\u2019s a reason these things don\u2019t change \u2014 it\u2019s because these things are being built in layers. And understanding why the Lightning Network developed the way it did \u2014 you have to crucially understand these concepts first, right? I think that\u2019s mainly covering most of these giant things. If you want we can go into how some of these overlap, but we already kind of started that. What do you think, Collin?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [41:52]: Yeah. Well, I\u2019ll touch on some of the things that you just mentioned. You were talking about how, a lot of people, they see the Bitcoiners ardently proclaiming that Bitcoin is so objectively more secure than any other project. And the layman hears that and says, This guy! This guy is trying to pump his bags! He cares more about his \u2014 he\u2019s selfish! He wants Bitcoin to win and he wants everyone else to lose! But the real objective truth is that we\u2019re talking orders of magnitude, the levels of security that Bitcoin has relative to everything else, and I would even argue \u2014 first of all, I think that proof of stake is stupid, but that\u2019s a rabbit hole we\u2019re not gonna go down right now. I would argue that minority proof of work chains, meaning any proof of work coin that isn\u2019t Bitcoin, is at a severe severe severe security disadvantage, for the reason that Ben talked about earlier, is that you can just take a small fraction of the hashpower from the Bitcoin network \u2014 leaving Bitcoin\u2019s security completely unchanged \u2014 and you can attack a minority chain with that. And you can affect a lot of people that are using that chain that way. And the Bitcoin\u2019s main security isn\u2019t even touched! So when people say, when you\u2019re on Twitter, you see people saying, Oh! Bitcoin is the only secure cryptocurrency. There\u2019s a reason that they\u2019re saying it! They\u2019re not talking under their butt, they\u2019re not trying to pump their bags \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [43:21]: Again, using logical reasoning, critical thinking, to understand these concepts. You know, a lot of us started with Bitcoin and then went on to the shitcoin path, like I personally bought a bunch, and \u2014 I actually still have a few \u2014 but like, I definitely want to sell them. And we got into Bitcoin, and then we were like, Oh wait! There\u2019s all these other things? This one\u2019s more efficient! And this one\u2019s faster! And this one is gonna be the Internet of Things money and this one\u2019s gonna be the world computer money! And, really, understanding the economics piece, is understanding why you really only want one money, because the more different types the money, the harder it is to trade, and there\u2019s more barriers in there!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Most definitely! I talked about this with the episode with Michael Goldstein where it\u2019s sort of akin to gift cards. There\u2019s a market for gift cards, but they\u2019re not liquid. Like, if you were gonna sell \u2014 if you get a gift card for Christmas, and you want to try to sell it, you can! There is a market for that, but you\u2019re gonna be selling it at a loss, because it\u2019s not a liquid market, and it\u2019s gonna be the same thing for a lot of these utility tokens, because they\u2019re not liquid! Nobody wants Target gift cards, because they\u2019re not a fungible currency."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: They\u2019re not money any more than gift cards are money. I mean gift cards you might think are money, sure, but they\u2019re a token that is only redeemable in one place. I think what we\u2019re starting to see is with what a lot of those utility tokens were trying to do \u2014 again, and you\u2019ll hear Bitcoiners say this a lot \u2014 we can all be done, eventually, using Bitcoin. Smart contracts are already a part of Bitcoin, you know, what Brave Browser was trying to do to incentivize people watching ads and getting a part of that revenue, it could all be done with Bitcoin! You don\u2019t need a token for that.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [45:32]: And it\u2019s an open source project, and GAB, you know some of my longtime viewers will remember I had Andrew Torba on my show and he talked about GAB, GAB right now is working on forking Brave Browser, pulling out BAT, and putting in Bitcoin and Lightning in its place. And it\u2019s just a matter of time before that happens to pretty much any crypto project out there with any merit whatsoever. Because, when I\u2019m looking at these \u2014 people send me all kinds of stupid projects all the time and they\u2019re like, Well, what about this? What do you think about this? If you can take the token, completely get rid of it, and replace it with Bitcoin? I think it\u2019s dumb."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Yes! Yes it did. The Schelling point that we arrive at is what Bitcoin really is. And it\u2019s very clear how much farther ahead Bitcoin is. It\u2019s much larger than all of the other cryptocurrencies put together. I wanted to talk about legal tender laws and inter-central bank cooperation. Essentially, we\u2019re talking about the governments stealing money from people by printing it. It turns out that \u2014 in the Bretton Woods agreement, essentially, in 1944, all the centrals of the different countries got together and agreed to inflate their currencies at the same rate. It was the closest thing we got to a gold standard in the last century. But they\u2019re all still robbing from all of their citizens, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [47:49]: And nobody would ever adhere 100% to that rate that they agreed on. There always would be someone that would cheat just a little bit."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: It didn\u2019t used to be. And many economists\u2014usually proponents of the free markets \u2014 stop short at money. They insist that money should be regulated by the government and issued by the government. But it didn\u2019t used to be. It used to be gold! We essentially, by confiscating gold and making it illegal to hold gold, we took the free market out of money completely! And we\u2019ve replaced it with these pieces of paper that allow us to create money with a keystroke. And [they\u2019ve] powerfully and subtly acquired the stored time of people \u2014 Misir Mahmudov talks about money as a stored time. You go work a bunch, and then later in life you redeem those tokens that you\u2019ve received. But if those tokens can be diluted, they\u2019re diluting your time! I had a friend who came to me and he was saying, If somebody wastes some of your time, they are murdering part of your life. They\u2019re actually taking part of your life away. Right? So if you go watch a 30-second ad, for example \u2014 and he started doing all the math and the average lifespan is 80 years or something, and he said \u2014 A minute of your time is a micromurder! Because he calculated how much time you have in your life, and if you waste one day of it, then it\u2019s one millionth of that or something. And I turned to him and I said, Well yeah, but you store your time in money! So if the government is diluting the supply of money, that means they\u2019re murdering you at 3% per year! And he goes, Oh. That\u2019s a really good point. [50:24] Legal tender laws are tied into this confiscation of gold thing, right? Where they essentially \u2014 the US government suspended redeemability of gold a number of times, until 1971, when Richard F\u2019ing Nixon suspended the redeemability of gold forever.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Right. And I would add, the reason this happens is because of something called Gresham\u2019s Law, which is where a good money will be hoarded, and bad money will be circulated. Meaning that, people \u2014 like, the free market knows what\u2019s good money and what\u2019s bad money. And that\u2019s why, in these systems where we had gold notes and gold in the banks, you\u2019d see people spending the bad money, and hoarding \u2014 you know, anytime they could get a hold of gold or silver coins, they\u2019d take it home and they\u2019d put it in the dresser drawer, or they\u2019d store it in a bank deposit box. Because even if they don\u2019t consciously realize it, they know that that holds its value, and that the paper gets diluted over time and it loses its value, and that\u2019s where these legal tender laws come from: is the government has to force people to use the paper that their brains tell them, No! That\u2019s not as good as the gold! Because it\u2019s not as hard of a value. The legal tender laws force you! You have to pay your taxes, you have to accept this if you own a store. You have to use this if you want somebody to buy your house. You\u2019re not allowed to just say, No, you have to pay me in gold bars, because legal tender laws force you to circumvent the free market demand."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [51:55]: Yes, to say it in other words: without the legal monopoly on money, we wouldn\u2019t use paper money, we would use gold! Again you have to understand why we use paper money in the first place. We started to use paper certificates of gold. They were stand-ins, where the gold was kept in vaults. And you get to the centralization of gold in vaults problem: the person that holds all the gold, really, is the person who holds all the money, not the people that hold the paper. Because you have to actually get the gold. If the paper is inflated too much, well then you\u2019re gonna want the gold back, but it\u2019s all held in banks and the government\u2019s confiscated it all. Oh and you talked about Gresham\u2019s Law, but I never talk about Gresham\u2019s Law without talking about Thiers\u2019 Law, which is like the reciprocal of it! So you talked about: bad money drives out good money, meaning that people hoard the good money, and the spend the bad money, so all the bad money is being spent in the economy. But Thiers\u2019 Law is when good money drives out bad money. Meaning that, once the purchasing power of the bad money gets so bad, people no longer want it at all. And that\u2019s when good money wins, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [53:07]: Which you see it happen in places like Venezuela, Weimar Germany \u2014"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: And what I have come to the conclusion of is that Bitcoin obviates almost every issue that is an issue with paper money. And gold! It has verifiable purity. It goes back to the verifiability of cryptography and math. So when you tested gold, to make sure that it was good gold, you had to melt it down or weigh it, you had to do all this stuff in order to make sure it\u2019s the right density, that it is actually gold. Well, Bitcoin is not only trivial to verify \u2014 like, how much digital gold somebody just gave you? You can actually melt down the entire supply of Bitcoin every ten minutes using your full node. So you can trivially verify all of the Bitcoin, you can melt down the entire supply all at once. It also cannot be inflated. The reason it cannot be inflated is the immutability of this very large decentralized network that is based on mathematical security that there will never be more than 21 million. Bitcoin will never be suppressed because of the BitTorrent thing. They made Napster, then Limewire, then Morpheus, but they couldn\u2019t shut down BitTorrent! And they still haven\u2019t, much to their dismay. Bitcoin cannot be turned off! And it can\u2019t really be suppressed. In Venezuela, they\u2019re trying to suppress Bitcoin, they\u2019re knocking on miners\u2019 doors and confiscating mining equipment in Venezuela. But you can send a packet anywhere in the world very easily by connecting to any network. And in the future mesh networking will become even more prolific. As Andreas says, when you turn money into a content type that can be sent over a radio, a satellite network now, we have Blockstream. This cannot be stopped.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin [55:24]: There was this story about the guys in Venezuela that were using their car battery to power some sort of transmitter to send a Bitcoin transaction through the Blockstream satellite."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Completely cut off from the grid, you can still send Bitcoin transactions. That\u2019s amazing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Just to talk about something you passed there real quick: you were talking about the auditable, verifiable supply. Someone challenged me not that long ago. They said, Well, yeah, everyone says that Bitcoin, there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins, but nobody can actually prove it! I pushed back, man! This was over on the thebitcoin.pub, it\u2019s a forum that I spend a lot of time on. I was like, No, I can prove it to you right now. I can show you how you can prove it! I can show you the blocks, I can show you where the coinbase is, I can show you the reward, I can show you exactly how much the reward paid out, and I can show you where each output went after it got spent. It is provable, and it\u2019s not that difficult. You don\u2019t even have to know that much about computers to be able to go into the blockchain data and prove, without a shadow of a doubt, exactly how many Bitcoin there are."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [56:38]: Well yeah, but unless you understand math and cryptography, there is still doubt, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Yeah, it means nothing to you. But the fact that people make that argument! You either have to take our word for it or you have to figure these things out for yourself."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Right! So we encourage you to not take our word for it and to go down this rabbit hole \u2014 and this is the rabbit hole that Marty Bent talks about, and a lot of us talk about, is that, this is the rabbit hole, guys \u2014 trying to understand all of these different things! It is no easy task, and Collin and I don\u2019t claim to understand it all! But we\u2019re trying!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: It\u2019s a monumental undertaking to look at this spectrum, and to pick out each individual thing and try to understand how each of them fit into this picture, and where they overlap, and the subtleties and the nuances of all of these different things, on top of a nascent technology that in and of itself is kind of difficult and complicated to understand!"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: Yeah and this takes me back to the history of money. We started off not having any money and just bartering and eventually people realized that everybody liked wheat, for example, and everybody used wheat as money because it was widely used. And then they went on and used shells and glass beads and stones \u2014 and all of these things got inflated. So inflation was really the problem with most monies. [57:55] [For] some of them durability was a problem. And eventually gold took over all money because it was the best money, not because a government enforced gold. It means that individually, separately, just like us Bitcoiners individually coming to the same conclusions, the markets across the world, individually, separate from each other, zeroed in on gold. And the reason that they zeroed in on gold was mostly because it was very difficult to inflate. It grew this very large stockpile, and then the flow of new gold coming in was so insignificant that you weren\u2019t diluting your supply of your stored time energy with your gold. But gold had a really big issue with it. It wasn\u2019t portable, and it wasn\u2019t divisible to the needs of the modern world. If I wanted to transact with somebody in Sweden or in Japan, well I have to mail them a bunch of gold, and that\u2019s why they started using money certificates that were stand-ins for the gold that could be easily moved around and they made it divisible and all this stuff. But it led to the centralization of gold in vaults and it gave governments all this undue power to manipulate the supply of money because we eventually got off of certificates and we got onto pure fiat money and all these other problems. But Bitcoin is a 10x improvement on gold, because A) it solves the portability issue. Obviously, it\u2019s digital information content type, we can move it around in ways that we can\u2019t even imagine yet! You know, the Lightning Network is talking about streaming money \u2014 these concepts that are still so foreign to us. B) It\u2019s censorship-resistant, meaning that nobody can stop you from using it. C) The innovation on Bitcoin. You don\u2019t need to go to a central bank and get permission from them. You don\u2019t need to go to the government to get permission from them. You don\u2019t need to go to Paypal and get permission to innovate and create new tools like streaming money or whatever. D) Access to it is access to anybody that has access to the Internet. A $20 cell phone as Andreas says, in Sudan, using a solar charger, can access this stuff. E) The unforgeable costliness, how much computing energy has gone into creating this blockchain that is now immutable because it has tens of thousands of nodes\u2014I think it\u2019s close to a hundred thousands nodes now \u2014 around the world. F) The verifiability, etc. All of this stuff is the improvement that Bitcoin is on gold and why we think Bitcoin will just start seeping into every place where it is better money than these other things. And I think the biggest challenge to Bitcoin right now is its biggest boon, which is the volatility. If you talk to anybody intelligent about this who isn\u2019t into Bitcoin, they\u2019ll say, Yeah but if I put my money in Bitcoin it can go up and down?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: \u201cSomething so volatile can never become money.\u201d"}

Just holding that and using it as money gives it a premium above its utility value.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Right. The vast majority of market cap from gold comes from store of value. It\u2019s not from industrial use cases."}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice: But what is Bitcoin? Bitcoin has no inherent utility, it is not a commodity, it has no inherent value! It only has value because we have given it value!

So Ben, we\u2019re coming up on the end of our time here. But I had one last big finale question for you here. So, at the bottom of this chart, we have game theory. And you see a lot of people, particularly the people that are newer to crypto, or have really just got Bitcoin and they want to get more people into it, and they ask the question, What\u2019s a good, simple, 5 minute explanation that I can use to make somebody understand Bitcoin and blockchain completely? And I think that we\u2019ve kind of demonstrated here by going through the spectrum, that there really isn\u2019t an answer to that question! People say, Well, you\u2019ll never be able to get my grandma to understand this thing! Ben, can you in your own words explain to us in regards to the game theory, why it doesn\u2019t matter whether or not everybody\u2019s gonna understand this thing one day? In regards to it becoming a money?"}
{"prompt": "Ben Prentice [63:54]: Game theory is this study of rational actors in a given situation, and how they will act. Essentially, it\u2019s funny because, you know, I spent so much time trying to tell people about Bitcoin, and some of them listened, and some of them don\u2019t, and some of them even have acquired some. But I think that everybody in the world is incentivized. They\u2019re game theoretically incentivized to acquire some of this, actually! And they\u2019re gonna buy some for the same reason I did. I told you this story, I knew about this a long time ago, but I only bought some when the price went up a lot! And I think the price is gonna continue going up! And understanding that is understanding all of the other stuff that I just talked about. But when the price goes up on something, well people get interested in it! And they might get a little bit! And then when people get some the hype surrounds it, the price goes up more. And people start to learn more about it. Which is what happened to me. I bought some, and then I started to learn a lot more about it. That\u2019s really the answer, is that I think that this is a better money! I think it\u2019s going to lead to prosperity for the people and not socialism for the rich. It\u2019s gonna lift everybody up, even the politicians, they\u2019re gonna be incentivized to buy some. Even rich people, they\u2019re gonna be incentivized to buy some. Maybe even central banks. I\u2019m not sure about that one. But I think we\u2019re all incentivized to want to hold the best money, and it is the best money, and that will help civilization scale in ways that we can\u2019t even imagine!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Collin: Well, this conversation was awesome.

This is either my second or third appearance, I can\u2019t remember exactly.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: I think it\u2019s the second one, but yeah, certainly there\u2019s a lot of interesting stuff going on, and I know you have been chatting about this whole topic as well, of stablecoins. So I thought it would be good to explore this topic together on: Is it bullish or bearish for Bitcoin? What are some of the things that we need to think about with stablecoins? So perhaps, to start off, just for listeners who might not be so familiar \u2014 what is a stablecoin and what are some of the main ones?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah, this is actually a topic of debate: What the definition of a stablecoin is. What should we even call them \u2014 it\u2019s not even necessarily settled, that stablecoins is the thing to call them. But basically, the way I define them, is: a tokenized representation of a fiat currency that circulates on-chain. So that\u2019s really the simplest definition. And then, there\u2019s a number of different ways they try and target the return profile of that sovereign currency. The main way is just by being redeemable for units of that currency that are immobilized in a commercial bank. But there\u2019s other ways. Some of them are, in my opinion, pretty crazy and not likely to work. The algorithmic uncollateralized model\u2014I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever really seen that work. I think it\u2019s unlikely to work. And then there\u2019s the maybe more interesting approach, which is to take some crypto-collateral, which is volatile, and use that basket to create something which is more stable in terms of its risk profile with algorithmic risk management systems. And you could in theory do that against Bitcoin. And then there\u2019s a final way to create stablecoins, which is to basically create a pair of Bitcoin derivative and a spot position, so you can have a short and a long position paired up together, and that\u2019s one way to create a stable which we\u2019re seeing out there. So there\u2019s a bunch of different ways to do it, but the key idea is, Hey, public blockchains are great for moving value around\u2014wouldn\u2019t it be great if we could move stable value around? I know a lot of Bitcoiners don\u2019t like this concept, but the truth is, it really is catching on, and it\u2019s one of the early industry killer apps.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [05:24]: I see. And it\u2019s probably also good to contextualize here: what\u2019s the kind of split in terms of the stablecoins? Are they, I presume, they are mostly \u2014 Tether is probably the elephant in the room here, right? Most of the stablecoin volume would be of that type, right? Like the type where it\u2019s US dollars in a bank account somewhere, and these stablecoins represent some claim, or their value is meant to reflect those, right?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah that\u2019s by far the most popular model, is the fiat collateralized or convertible model, whereby, in theory, by holding this token, you could again, in theory, redeem it for units of actual currency in a commercial bank somewhere. Now with Tether and actually other ones, there\u2019s complications\u2014 not everyone can necessarily redeem it. You might have to be a special entity or you might have to have a certain threshhold in order to do that redemption. But it\u2019s still the possibility of redemption which is the thing that keeps it trading around one dollar.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [06:30]: Yeah. And so, who are the main users of these products?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Well it\u2019s hard to directly apprehend that, right? Because, if you\u2019re using a stablecoin, you\u2019re outside of the traditional financial system, and you might be outside of that system for good reason. You might be an import/export business operating on a cross-border between Russia and China, and you have very good reasons to not make your transactions known to the authorities. And so, you are strongly incentivized to not broadcast your usage of stablecoins. I think unambiguously the biggest consumers of stablecoins are just entities that are active in the cryptocurrency markets, so: traders, hedge funds, proprietary funds, arbitrage funds, market makers, these are the entities that need crypto-denominated liquidity, and they need an arbitrage or a market maker firm, you know, they\u2019ll be active on dozens of exchanges at the same time. They need to manage their collateral. They might have a preference to hold it in fiat terms. They may not want to be directionally long Bitcoin at all times. So they might prefer dollar-based collateral. And so, stablecoins would be a good choice for them. They get the settlement assurances of using a public blockchain, but they also get to manage their risk in terms of volatility. So that\u2019s a huge, huge consumer of stablecoins. Increasingly we just also have regular old businesses denominating their balance sheet in stablecoins, and more and more, the firms that we invest on, as a venture fund, will ask us for a stablecoin-denominated investment. They don\u2019t want to get bank wires. They want USDC. And we\u2019ve begun to do that as well. So what we\u2019re seeing is the whole supply chain of some of these early stage businesses is flipping from commercial bank liquidity to on-chain liquidity, and it flips because they\u2019ll receive investment in stablecoin terms, and then their expenditures will be denominated in stablecoin terms. This crypto industry is a globalized system where there\u2019s less geographic hubs of consequence, and the talent is much more globally dispersed. For payroll for instance, for a global audience, it actually is generally more convenient to use something like USDT or USDC to pay people if you have employees in fifteen different countries. That\u2019s probably cheaper and easier than the corresponding banking system. And so you see the whole supply chain of certain businesses flipping from being commercial bank based to being crypto-liquidity based. So that\u2019s another really interesting new genre of stablecoin consumer that we\u2019ve seen emerge this year. But yeah it was an easier question to answer two years ago when it really was just traders that was using stablecoins. Today it\u2019s just all kinds of businesses, I mean we have FinTech providers, we\u2019ve invested in some of these businesses that are giving stablecoin access\u2014or intermediated access to stablecoins \u2014 in countries where there\u2019s currency crises, as kind of a FinTech product. So yeah the phenomenon is really taking off and there\u2019s a really heterogeneous set of entities that actually use these things.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [10:16]: I think probably the obvious question that is going through many listeners\u2019 minds\u2014they might be thinking, Well hang on, why don\u2019t they just pay directly in Bitcoin but denominate it in USD? And I can guess there\u2019s probably some good answers for that. What would you speculate, or if you know? Why do you think that is?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah. I mean it\u2019s a very fair question! I would say probably the main reason is the mental transaction cost of introducing a new numeraire. Now Bitcoin, probably about 50\u2013100 million worldwide are familiar with Bitcoin, but probably half of the world\u2019s population is familiar with the dollar. The dollar is the de facto global reserve currency. And then, even in countries where dollars aren\u2019t the local currency, people still kind of know how to price things in dollars. They have an appreciation for the dollar. And this isn\u2019t like my love-letter to the Federal Reserve or anything. It\u2019s just a statement of reality. As a unit of account, the dollar is very popular. So I think people are just more comfortable in receiving payments in dollar terms, at this state of Bitcoin adoption. Of course, I expect that to change in the long term as Bitcoin becomes much more ubiquitous, but for now, stablecoins are kind of an intermediate or bridge asset where people are realizing, Hey, public blockchain infrastructure is actually a more convenient way to do business, especially on a cross-border basis. But they haven\u2019t fully become used to Bitcoin as their unit of account, so for this transitional period, it\u2019s a really suitable asset, basically.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [12:05]: Right. And I presume it\u2019s also a volatility aspect of it, that they would prefer to hold USD because maybe their expenses are in turn in USD in terms of their rent or their food and other living costs."}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah, not everyone is like us and, you know, willing to tolerate the volatility of Bitcoin. And for payments while payments are in flight, you don\u2019t necessarily want the exchange rate to be changing dramatically. So yeah, there\u2019s good reasons to use the dollar. My view is that these things are strongly mutualistic, and so I don\u2019t see cryptodollars as stablecoins as being a threat to Bitcoin in any way. I think they\u2019re kind of supportive of each other.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [12:51]: Yeah. And my understanding is also that there are traders who are using it to get around the exchanges quickly in terms of doing the fiat leg a bit faster for them to arbitrage and things like that. But there\u2019s also this story of people in other countries around the world who want to get around capital or currency controls, in some cases, get their money out of the country. Have you seen that in your travels and your discussions in the industry?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah. I mean, this is an established concept today. So, Chainalysis, you know, a lot of people consider them to be villainous. They do put out some good research, so I would encourage your listeners to look at their report where they find \u2014 and I have no reason to doubt their methodology, I think it\u2019s probably quite sound \u2014 they find about $50 billion worth of capital outflows from China taking place in Tether terms. So these are real numbers, and so that\u2019s a story about evading capital controls. And now, the Chinese government may not like that, but we\u2019re talking about a new epoch in payments technology. We\u2019re talking about digital bearer assets. This is their manifestation. This is what people choose to use them for, and that\u2019s just a reality. And if you look at Tether transactions, you can see they happen mostly during Asian trading hours. So they\u2019re very, very popular as an alternative payment system, and a way to offshore wealth from countries that are engaging in monetary repression. A more direct answer, where I have firsthand experience, would be in places like Latin America, Argentina in particular, Venezuela and Colombia. In those three countries the currencies are very weak. There\u2019s a big Venezuelan diaspora which is internally displaced within Latin America. There\u2019s a number of startups that are using \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of Bitcoin there \u2014 but there\u2019s also a number of startups that are using stablecoins to give people a dollar savings device. Now there are dollars that are present in those countries, physical dollars. But they\u2019re kind of hard to get your hands on, and they aren\u2019t necessarily in the right denominations, there\u2019s a lack of small denomination bills. And of course dollars are easy to seize. And there is Bitcoinization occuring, of course, but there\u2019s also a movement where people are engaging in this cryptodollarization, where they are getting exposure to dollar-based products through public blockchains. Now, Bitcoin is critical in this whole process, but what people are really after, for the most part, is dollars. And they\u2019re seeking dollars as a way to connect remittances, move money around, without asking for permission \u2014 but also as a wealth preservation device. We\u2019ve invested in startups active down there doing exactly that. I think FinTech experiences that are built on top of cryptodollar rails are gonna be a much more pervasive concept in the next five years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: Yeah so it\u2019s a range of different people who are using these stablecoins, whether it\u2019s traders or companies who want to get funded in stablecoins, or people in the developing world who want to get around capital and currency controls. So my understanding as well is with some of the South American stories, is that there are all kinds of different ways that people are using different payments, whether that\u2019s things like Zelle or some of these other normal fiat banking dollars, but this is just now presenting another option for people who want to try to \u2014 maybe they\u2019re not necessarily looking for the maximum level of censorship-resistance, but they\u2019re just using some of these different bank accounts and so on, and this is just another way of helping \u2014 maybe we can think of it like greasing the wheels, right?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [17:04]: Yeah. Zelle is very popular in Venezuela, you\u2019re absolutely right. But Zelle is also created by a consortium of US banks, and those banks aren\u2019t really too keen on having end-users in Venezuela, because there are no formal US sanctions on the country of Venezuela, but there are sanctions on members of the Maduro regime, and it\u2019s kind of like taint, if you think about taint in the network graph. It\u2019s basically the same concept. If you go to the coffee shop which is run by the nephew of the minister of transport, and he happens to be sanctioned, there\u2019s a risk that you inherit that as well. So you become tainted by association, and then you get de-platformed from all of your Western FinTech and payment apps. And so that happens a lot. Wells Fargo has been on a real campaign to basically deplatform the Venezuelan users of Zelle. So Zelle is good UX and people really seem to like it, but it\u2019s very much exposed to what the banks want to do. Now stablecoins have bank relationships, for most of them. The fiat-convertible ones, you know, those ultimately are claims on dollars in a bank. You don\u2019t need to interface with a bank to use a stablecoin, you just need to acquire it on the open markets and receive it on an on-chain transactions. 99% of stablecoin transactions don\u2019t involve facing off against the bank directly, or against the issuer. So they are kind of less encumbered than commercial bank relationships, and I know people talk about the freezing possibility. Tether has frozen a couple hundred addresses in its history. USDC has frozen a small handful. So that does happen, but it\u2019s nowhere near as pervasive as deplatforming from the financial system. So it\u2019s certainly not as censor-resistant as Bitcoin. Now there are stablecoins you can look to which probably have slightly better censor-resistant qualities like DAI, which is built against crypto-collateral and\u2014in theory you could do the same with Bitcoin! You could probably figure out how to build a stablecoin using DLCs or other smart contracting technologies to build a dollar-denominated asset which is backed by a basket of Bitcoins, which would also be pretty trustless. And I expect someone to make that in the next year or so. So even within the stablecoin space there\u2019s a bit of nuance in terms of the settlement assurances you have.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [20:01]: Yeah that\u2019s an interesting idea there as well. I recall from one of my relatively recent episodes with Nadav Kohen from Suredbits, he spoke about exactly that kind of idea: using discrete log contracts to do a similar kind of thing with Bitcoin. One other point I wanted to touch on was around the compliance aspects. So you were mentioning there: usually AML laws and sanctions laws that we\u2019re talking about here\u2014and to be clear, one of them is Politically Exposed Persons \u2014 so that\u2019s where there\u2019s whole idea of, if you\u2019re a politician or you\u2019re a senior level bureaucrat or something and then your family might be also implicated in that. But with stablecoins it\u2019s more like, the compliance seems to be occuring at the entry and the exit points, and once you\u2019re kind of inside that system it seems to be more of a freewheeling system, wouldn\u2019t you say?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [21:04]: Yeah. Anybody that looks into stablecoins long enough eventually has this realization, and it\u2019s like, Oh wow! This is actually a little bit different from the way that the financial system works. Or even something like PayPal, right? Pretty much every single transaction on PayPal contains metadata and identity information. And PayPal has the right\u2014and they take advantage of this \u2014 to freeze any of those transactions. In fact, I sent a joke PayPal transaction to my friend Neeraj of CoinCenter, and I think I made the memo field something like \u201cNorth Korea\u201d and like \u201cPersian Rugs\u201d just to see what would happen, and they froze it!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: Ha ha, you were trying to get his account cancelled?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Every single transaction in most mainstream FinTech apps is effectively surveilled, or risk analytics are being run against them. Now in stablecoins, as you say, those egress and ingress transactions where you are creating or redeeming stablecoins, there\u2019s KYC involved there. But on the internals of the transaction graph, those transactions that are actually ocurring on either Bitcoin, on the OMNI protocol, or on Etheream as ERC-20 transactions, or even on TRON which is popular for stablecoins for some reason, those P2P transfers are really not meaningfully being surveilled. There\u2019s not a lot of identity information that can be associated with them, because it\u2019s pseudonymous. So on the internals of the transaction graph you have a situation where it much more resembles actual digital cash, in the same way that physical cash transfers do not carry any surveillance. And basically, P2P stablecoin transfers, on-chain, much more closely resemble physical cash transactions, and they have less in common with these transactions on these digital payments networks that we\u2019re used to. And it\u2019s kind of a startling realization. JP Koning, who is not a Bitcoiner but he writes fairly intelligently about payment networks, has called this the permissioned pseudonymity model, and it\u2019s honestly a really big outstanding question whether the state or regulators are gonna take a look at this and realize what\u2019s going on and say, Okay, we\u2019ve got to put an end to this!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [23:32]: Yeah, that\u2019s an interesting question, because, if they allow this to carry on, well then, it just kind of helps this overall greasing of the wheels, if you will, in and around the exchanges of the space. And so, it allows all sorts of hack workarounds in some ways. Whereas, if they do clamp down harder, then obviously it becomes more difficult for people to get money in and out of exchanges and move it around, and do all of these other on the side things, and other services that are operating on a more stablecoin basis, like stablecoin lending and so on."}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [24:14]: Yeah, and I honestly don\u2019t know how regulators would build regulation into stablecoin networks. Fundamentally, we\u2019re talking about blockchains which are pseudonymous. I\u2019m not sure how you would try and inject identity information. Currently stablecoin issuers operate on a blacklist model, where they will blacklist certain addresses and freeze those funds if, for instance, they get a subpoena from law enforcement that says, Hey, this is an entity that hacked an exchange \u2014 could you immobilize these funds? But you can\u2019t transition that really easily to a whitelist model where default node transactions are permitted unless you make yourself known to the issuer. The whitelist model would just make these networks not work. So I don\u2019t know functionally what it would even look like for regulators to even grapple with this.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [25:16]: Yeah. I guess that\u2019s a tougher one to answer. I would also like just get a bit of context around the volumes that we\u2019re talking about here. What kinds of volume are we looking at in terms of stablecoins versus, say, Bitcoin volume?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Currently, collectively, all of the stablecoins will do about $5 billion worth of settled value every single day. So, pretty meaningful \u2014 it\u2019s up from effectively zero a couple years ago. Now Bitcoin is doing also about $5 billion of settled value per day. Now the thing to note though is that Bitcoin\u2019s aggregate market cap is north of $300 billion. The aggregate market cap of stablecoins is closer to $25 billion, so you can see that stablecoins have a much higher velocity. They\u2019re turning over more frequently, whereas Bitcoin has a much slower velocity. So what this tells us is that they\u2019re doing roughly equal amounts in terms of settling value every day, but stablecoins are doing so with the whole supply turning over more frequently, which shows that they\u2019re being employed more as means of payment, whereas Bitcoin is this more slow-moving wealth storage mechanism.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [28:38]: Okay, so that\u2019s around the volume of stablecoins in relation to Bitcoin. I think it\u2019s also a good point now to explore the bull and bear cases for stablecoins, and whether they are bullish for Bitcoin or bearish for Bitcoin? Do they work with it or are they in some way detracting from Bitcoin demand? Now I know you are more on the bullish side, but let\u2019s\u2019 first explore some of the bearish arguments, right? So maybe one of the bearish arguments would be, Oh, it\u2019s detracting from Bitcoin demand! Some people might just stay in stablecoins rather than using Bitcoin. What do you think?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah. Honestly that\u2019s already happened to a certain degree. If you look at exchange volumes, if you look at the pairs that are traded globally, if you look at exchange reserves, you notice that a lot of these\u2014what would formerly trade against Bitcoin\u2014all these exchanges with altcoin pairs and derivatives with Bitcoin being the more popular asset, either the base pair or the quote pair. I\u2019m forgetting which one it is. Bitcoin was the de facto reserve asset of the crypto industry from the inception, right? And over the last couple of years, many exchanges becamed Tetherized, so Tether became the base pair, and all of these markets were expressed in Tether terms, and the main collateral that was held on these exchanges was Tether, effectively. So you had some purist exchanges\u2014like BitMex, they were a purist exchange. They never had any stablecoins on there. The only way to get collateral on the exchange was on Bitcoin terms. But, you know, now they\u2019ve shrunk a little, and other newer exchanges like ByBit and FTX, they all use Tether as the main form of collateral, and the main way to make a deposit, and a lot of them quote their markets in Tether. So this has actually already happened! But what\u2019s interesting is, here we are, back at all time highs for Bitcoin. So this kind of implies that, Yes, some of this reservation demand for being the reserve asset for altcoin trading and for derivatives trading, some of that reservation demand was effectively removed and was moved into Tether, basically\u2014and other stablecoins, right? But this hasn\u2019t really affected Bitcoin! Bitcoin is still fine! So it\u2019s just the nature of Bitcoin that\u2019s changing a little bit, it\u2019s more of a global macro asset. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need that reservation demand. But yes, unambiguously I think exchanges getting Tetherized did remove a certain reservation demand from Bitcoin, and probably had a bit of a price impact. It\u2019s impossible to quantify. The ultimate question is, Can stablecoins sustain this indefinitely? And I would probably argue, No, I don\u2019t think they have the same characteristics as Bitcoin, because stablecoins are ultimately someone\u2019s liability. They\u2019re a liability of an issuer, in most cases, of a commercial bank. And that\u2019s not a great property to have for a monetary good! Pure monetary goods like gold and Bitcoin are no one\u2019s liability. Their value comes not from someone else promising to back it, but the value is solely market determined, which is the case for Bitcoin. So ultimately, the true reserve asset, the true monetary base asset at the base of that pyramid \u2014 you do want it to be something that\u2019s trustless collateral, which stablecoins are not. So I don\u2019t think they can ever really fully replace Bitcoin as that key high-powered collateral.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [32:32]: Yeah. I think that\u2019s really nicely put, because ultimately they\u2019re not monetary competitors with Bitcoin in the longer term sense, they are just more like a helping tool or a bridging tool that people are using in the here and now. And also, to the point about volumes and sizes, obviously there\u2019s this whole canard that seems to come up from some people who are not that familiar with what Tether is and what some of these stablecoins are. The typical argument is, Oh, see! Bitcoin is being pumped by Tether! What do you think on that kind of argument?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [33:11]: Yeah. So I\u2019ll go on the record here, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve ever really addressed it on a podcast before. Yeah I\u2019d love to see some evidence of that. I think the onus and the burden of proof is on the people making the positive claim. All the proof I\u2019ve ever seen, all the evidence\u2014talking to traders that have created hundreds of millions, in some cases billions of dollars worth of Tether \u2014 is that there is a counter-party there, they are using bank wires, they\u2019re using real fiat currency through the commercial banking system around, to create and redeem Tether! And I am not a Tether user, I personally have never used Tether, but I had Dan Matuszewski on my podcast a while back, and he told me that when he was at the Circle OTC desk they created billions of dollars worth of Tether, and that\u2019s with bank wires! So that\u2019s taking real dollars and wiring them to the counter-party and getting Tethers against those dollars. And then redeem them on the other side. That\u2019s all consistent with Tether being, at least in some sense, a real thing. Now obviously it\u2019s impossible to ascertain the reserve quality, and that\u2019s a huge shortcoming which I totally agree should be addressed. And I\u2019d love to see more transparency behind all of the stablecoin issuers, not just Tether. It\u2019s actually hard to get good reliable information on the quality of the reserves, for even the on-shore US based stablecoin issuers. But now this notion is taken a little bit further\u2014which is that Tether is somehow responsible for the price of Bitcoin \u2014 is just preposterous to me! There\u2019s one study from Griffin and Shams, which relied on timing analysis, and they found that, during periods when Tether was being issued, Bitcoin\u2019s price rose in those periods, which is \u2014 you know there\u2019s so many alternative explanations that aren\u2019t consistent with Tether somehow buoying the price of Bitcoin. The obvious alternative explanation is, Well, traders were engaging in dip buying, and they used Tether as a conduit to get into crypto exchanges, get into crypto liquidity. It\u2019s no coincidence that Tether issuance was happening at the same time as they were placing their buy orders, because they were using those Tethers to subsequently buy Bitcoin. So, there\u2019s very simple alternative explanations there. The other thing is, part of their paper relied on this analysis of looking on-chain and seeing when there are high periods of on-chain volumes for Tether and finding that that correlated with Bitcoin price increases. But the other thing to point out there is, price increases are synchronous and coincident with high on-chain transfers, just by their very nature, because when price is going up, there\u2019s a lot of activity. Those arbitrage funds kick in to high gear. So that\u2019s also something that can be very easily explained. Look, I\u2019m not gonna deny that Tether could be doing a much better job of their transparency, and at this point they\u2019re systemic to the whole crypto industry. So, like many others, I would love to see more transparency from them in their reserve quality. But I\u2019ve also never seen any direct evidence whatsoever, that Tether is somehow either unbacked or, more perniciously, being used to inflate the price of Bitcoin, which makes no sense. I mean, if you\u2019re Tether, and you could magically inflate the price of Bitcoin by printing unbacked Tethers without the market ascertaining that, what\u2019s to stop you printing the price of Bitcoin arbitrarily high? Why, in that case, are we only at $19,000? Why aren\u2019t we at $300,000? You know? The critics don\u2019t really have a plausible story to tell here. The other thing I\u2019ll mention is that there have been subsequent analyses that have focused on the same Griffin and Shams paper and have found no direct effect between Tether issuance and the Bitcoin price. One was by Viswanath-Natraj. The academia isn\u2019t settled on this topic, either.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [37:43]: Yeah. Just a historical comment: it seems that every run seems to have it\u2019s own little story as well, right? So 2013 it was Mt. Gox and the Willy Bot. And then in 2017 the story people have is, Oh! I see it was pumped by Tether! And then so even this bull run, you\u2019re hearing some people saying, Oh! See! It\u2019s GBTC! Right? We tell ourselves these little stories, but those aren\u2019t necessarily the full explaining factor."}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah. The other thing to note is that Bitcoin was roughly flat for a long 2-year period here, if you measure from late 2018 to earlier this year. Whereas Tether was increasing by a full order of magnitude. It went from a couple billion in late 2017 to $25 billion today. So for a long period where Bitcoin was trading sideways, more funds were getting onshored onto Tether, partly due to this replacement that I mentioned, where Bitcoin ceased to be the crypto reserve asset, or lost some of its qualities as the crypto reserve asset. So Tether was increasing by hundreds and hundreds of percent, but Bitcoin was flat during that time, so that\u2019s completely inconsistent with this Tether inflates Bitcoin thesis as well.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [39:12]: Right, I see. If I was to put on my Peter Schiff or Nouriel hat, they would say, Oh! See! They were just trying to pump it so hard! And they needed to keep making all these Tethers to even try to keep it the same! But I think, at some point, you\u2019re just never gonna convince some people, so you just have to let them wait until they\u2019re comfortable to actually see Bitcoin for what it is."}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [39:35]: Yeah. People like one-dimensional explanations for price action. Nobody seems comfortable with the fact that Bitcoin is just undergoing this process of monetization and waves of adoption, and that\u2019s a fundamentally random process in terms of how the key variables interlock, but it\u2019s also just a long term secular process of growth! Rather, people would instead lean on these incredibly simplistic explanations of insidious market makers somehow manipulating the whole market and manipulating price upwards. They can\u2019t find it in their souls to believe that Bitcoin is just this newly monetizing monetary commodity. That\u2019s too difficult or complex of an explanation for them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [40:30]: Yeah. Perhaps at some level they\u2019ve already committed their minds in a certain direction and now to turn around and go back, maybe that\u2019s just difficult for people to do or maybe they feel that would make them look weak or whatever. One other point that you brought up there recently is systemic risk and blow-up. That could potentially be another bear case for stablecoins in terms of Bitcoin impact. If one of these big ones\u2014for example Tether, or one of the other ones \u2014 if there were to be some big systemic blow-up, could that look really bad for the ecosystem?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [41:09]: Yes, it could. And I think the big casualty would actually be longtail altcoins, which trade exclusively against Tether. A lot of these marketplaces and exchanges don\u2019t have connectivity to a fiat system, and in fact the reason they\u2019ve been able to emerge is because stablecoins exist, right? So once stablecoins were in place, this new set of altcoin exchanges could emerge. And they have done so. They would be the big casualties if Tether blew up. And that would eviscerate the liquidity for a lot of longtail alts that are traded only against crypto-pairs. They\u2019re no fiat pairs for those altcoins. So they would be the big casualties in my opinion. Now the effect on Bitcoin is more mixed, and I think what is very possible is that there would be an inflow of funds back into Bitcoin as a kind of safety net, because if it emerged that Tether was insolvent or not fully reserved or something, what are traders gonna do with the Tethers that they hold? What is the most liquid pair that Tether is traded against? It\u2019s against Bitcoin! So I think that\u2019s where they flee! It might be more challenging for them to flee back into their sovereign currencies and they may not want to do that. So I think they flee into the alternative crypto reserve asset which is truly liability-free, and cannot be impaired by a lack of reserves, the same way Tether can be. So my guess is if anything happens to Tether, a lot of capital is gonna flow back into Bitcoin as safety net, the same way that you have a global risk-off even in regular capital markets, and capital flows into US Treasuries, which is considered the safest and most liquid asset. So I would say there is the potential for it to actually cause a huge capital inflow back into Bitcoin. And we\u2019re talking about roughly $20 billion worth of Tether, so it\u2019s a really material amount. So bad for crypto markets generally, but potentially good for Bitcoin as this liability free base asset.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [43:24]: That\u2019s a really great way to put it! One other kind of bearish argument \u2014 but it\u2019s not exactly \u2014 it\u2019s more just about, there\u2019s different platforms, and we\u2019re taking different kinds of technological risk when we use them, so obviously things like, if you use some coin that is really centralized as a platform, then is there a risk that some rollback changes things for you, or that potentially it is more amenable or more likely to get shut down, or to go down under its own steam? And then the stablecoin people are left holding a bag if they\u2019re using an altcoin platform to do that stablecoin with. Do you have any thoughts on that, and how the market participants are evaluating that risk?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [44:17]: Yeah. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re evaluating it, Stephan, to be honest with you. The most number of Tethers that ever existed on Bitcoin was about $3 billion. Now, on TRON, there\u2019s double that today: there\u2019s $6 billion worth of Tethers that circulate on TRON, they\u2019ve got a fixed validator set and it\u2019s pretty centralized in terms of the node validation and the consensus formation, right? I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be that difficult for a highly motivated state actor to interfere with TRON if they wanted. But you have more Tethers circulating on TRON, lots more, than ever circulated on the OMNI protocol on Bitcoin. And on Ethereum, you have over $12 billion worth of Tether, and you also have billions of dollars worth of other stablecoins on Ethereum too, like USDC. There\u2019s another $3 billion of USDC on Ethereum! So I think the entities using Tether, they kind of just take it as a given that the blockchains that they circulate on are just gonna function well in perpetuity. They don\u2019t seem too concerned about it, and they switch between them all the time. What they do is they use these exchanges as these hubs to switch between Tether Bitcoin, Tether Ethereum, and Tether TRON. So they switch between them seamlessly. It seems like traders treat it as the same asset regardless of the actual blockchain infrastructure that it\u2019s circulating on. But yeah, it seems to me that people aren\u2019t really concerned with the underlying infrastructure, and maybe they feel that if something were to go wrong, then the ultimate ledger would be managed by Tether itself, and effectively Tether maintains an off-chain ledger of their own, where they can step in if something goes terribly wrong.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [46:26]: I see. So at the end of the day, these things are just far more centralized anyway, so most people are just gonna \u2014 the participants in the market are relying on that as their get out of jail free card if something were to blow up with TRON or Ethereum and so on?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah I think so! And people already appeal to Bitfinex and Tether when something goes wrong with Tether, and this is another thing: when you see exchange hacks. Now the fact that some of these stablecoins have this reversibility\u2014which is a bug in my opinion, but on stablecoins it\u2019s treated as a feature\u2014this reversibility allows for the undoing of some negative events. So Tether has already begun to play that role.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [47:12]: Yeah so I guess we can say, Well, look. These are more openly centralized. And so even in the case of a blow-up, they\u2019re just more centralized anyway, so it\u2019s just not gonna \u2014 hard to go from there. Those are the main bear arguments I can think of. Actually, are there any other bearish arguments while we\u2019re here, before we go on to bull arguments?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah, and this is very salient to our current discussions: the other thing is that, if you talk to a central banker about the cryptocurrency space, and you ask them, What are you nervous about? They will almost always say stablecoins! They typically don\u2019t say Bitcoin! I don\u2019t know if this has been your experience as well? But it\u2019s certainly the case with me. Central bankers are fixated on stablecoins, and really, Libra is actually the one they care the most about. But increasingly, also, the stablecoins that exist on-chain. So stablecoins have catalyzed a lot of keen investigation on the part of central banks and financial regulators into the crypto space, and they could be the element of this industry that actually gets governments to care about it, and attempt to crack down on it. Because all of these central bankers are pretty afraid of \u2014 not necessarily Bitcoinization \u2014 but involuntary dollarization, whereby they lose their monetary privilege, because stablecoins become so frictionless and easy to acquire that there\u2019s a currency substitution that occurs in their country. And for sure this is something that\u2019s happening in Venezuela today, it\u2019s happened historically in Equador \u2014 not with crypto rails, of course, but with physical dollars \u2014 so it\u2019s not too far-fetched to think that this totally is possible. So the way that that could affect Bitcoin would just be by causing a regulatory hammerblow to fall on the industry. Now I think that we all expect and hope that Bitcoin is sufficiently robust that it can deal with that if the time comes, but that\u2019s another part of the bear case is that the stablecoins provoke governments into cracking down pretty hard on the industry.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [49:36]: Yeah that\u2019s a good point. And so, just to clarify there, in some sense, the US government is kind of happy that more people are gonna use the US dollar, right? It\u2019s more other countries who are gonna be unhappy about, basically \u2014 historically, you had to use physical cash to try and US dollarize, but now that people can do it with stablecoins, that makes it more of a risk for them, and if you\u2019re the Venezuelan government, that\u2019s why it\u2019s more of a concern for you, right?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah exactly, it\u2019s just easier to dollarize on public blockchain rails, and so potentially it could happen more aggressively. On your question about the US government I would say it\u2019s a little more nuanced. I mean, the government does issue the world\u2019s reserve currency and they wield strong benefits from doing that, but they don\u2019t want dollars to be percolating out into the world through a means that they don\u2019t control. And currently they don\u2019t control stablecoin infrastructure. You know, it\u2019s run as a protocol by a bunch of nodes. And so, that\u2019s also part of the reason we\u2019ve seen a bunch of policymakers in the US express their misgivings about it, even if it is effectively adding demand to the dollar, and potentially exporting the dollar overseas. It\u2019s doing it in a way that\u2019s outside the New York based correspondent banking system, outside of their surveillance apparatus. So, my guess is that they\u2019re actually not too happy about it, all things considered.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [51:11]: Right. And it may be different regulators in different parties who have different concerns. And so the ones who are more concerned at like, say FinCEN, might be more concerned because they have less visibility into their whole financial surveillance network. So let\u2019s bring it to the bull arguments then. So the bullish case for stablecoins in terms of their impact on Bitcoin. I guess the main one that I can think of is just that it helps the overall liquidity and greasing the wheels for people to move through the exchanges and through different, other businesses and products and services that can be built using stablecoins that weren\u2019t otherwise possible with Bitcoin. What\u2019s your view on that kind of idea?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [52:04]: Yeah, so that\u2019s undeniably a positive for Bitcoin. Just more liquidity, better connectivity between exchanges. So if you\u2019re [into] dislocations and into exchange prices \u2014 the existence of stablecoins mean that these arbitrage funds can operate in a capital efficient way, which is good for Bitcoin liquidity. I would say that that\u2019s the number one way. But the number two thing I would point you to would be, stablecoins might be penetrating a global audience of potential Bitcoin adopters before they have the experience of using Bitcoin. So, right now, the first experience most people have with cryptocurrency is with Bitcoin. And that\u2019s kind of been the default way that people get exposure to storing cryptographic information, storing value in the form of key pairs. And getting used to that concept. But it could be the case that, in a couple of years time, the default that people would get exposure to this concept \u2014 this is a transition that people need to go through: understanding information as value. We\u2019ve never really had to deal with that before. The default way they might do that would be through a stablecoin lens. Bitcoiners might not like hearing that, but it\u2019s totally possible in my mind, that that\u2019s the more immediately addressable way that people get exposure to digital assets, basically. And I think that could actually be an accelerant to the whole concept, and let people go through that learning experience, and then when they\u2019re ready, they could level up and then go to non-state monetary assets like Bitcoin. I think that\u2019s another way is that it penetrates a slightly different niche. It\u2019s people that maybe want dollars, and they\u2019re willing to consider this alternative infrastructure for those dollars, and once they\u2019re onboarded onto that and they\u2019re mentally ready, then they can make the leap to Bitcoin. So that would be the second way I think it could be really positive for Bitcoin. The third thing, and this is already a feature of the market, is that stablecoins only exist because of Bitcoin, and a lot of these stablecoin pairs are only liquid in a lot of these markets also because of Bitcoin. There\u2019s plenty of stablecoin usage in Venezuela, but that market was bootstrapped by the LocalBitcoins peer to peer market, where Bitcoin was obviously the main asset. So Bitcoin is this kind of non-state asset which is available globally, permenantly. It\u2019s the asset against which stablecoins trade most of the time. So Bitcoin is the true, ultimate clearinghouse of value, and then stablecoins are trading against Bitcoin. So it gives stablecoins a liability-free pair to trade into, and the way I see it is, we\u2019re getting progressive waves of regulation here, and so the popularity of stablecoins is gonna rise and fall over the years as regulators get more and less onerous. But Bitcoin will always be there, and at the times when nation-states are more hostile to stablecoins, more value will flow back into Bitcoin. And then as things open up again, some value will flow back into stablecoins, as the perceived risk declines. And so I think you just get this back and forth, but the constant is that Bitcoin is always gonna be there as this capital sanctus, to satisfy this demand, and to be this monetary constant, with stablecoins waxing and waning around Bitcoin. So it\u2019s a difficult concept to express, but Bitcoin\u2019s permanent presence in these markets is what permits stablecoins to work. So stablecoins certainly need Bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t need stablecoins, but I think it certainly benefits from their existence.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [56:15]: Yeah, very interesting argument. So essentially you\u2019re saying that they have some kind of a symbiotic relationship. They\u2019re both benefiting from each other!"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Absolutely! And the thing I didn\u2019t mention is that I believe that stablecoins will be issued against Bitcoin in the future. And we probably aren\u2019t going to have to wait that long for that to happen. There are already stablecoins being issued against spot Bitcoin, where you short Bitcoin, and you have a spot long position, and that bundle of the two creates a dollar-stable position. So that\u2019s one way that some people are creating a stablecoin against Bitcoin. But you could also do it in a Maker style, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that the smart contracting ability in Bitcoin is gonna progress in the future to a state where it\u2019s totally possible to build the equivalent of Maker on Bitcoin. And then we\u2019ll just take the most successful concepts in DeFi and apply them to Bitcoin in a trust-minimized way. And if you look at DAI, DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins on Ethereum. It really punches above its weight in terms of its philosophy. So I think the Bitcoin equivalent would also be pretty popular, honestly. A Bitcoin-native dollar-stable asset, facilitated and issued against Bitcoin collateral \u2014 I think that is a good idea. And so I do expect that in the future, Bitcoin will be a reserve asset for the issuance of stablecoins, and of course that will increase the reservation demand for Bitcoin. So that\u2019s kind of the final thing: stablecoins are strong evidence of the fact that people desire dollar-denominated liquidity on-chain. And they\u2019re willing to issue it against crypto-collateral. And I think Bitcoin is obviously the best form of collateral on-chain, because it has the best volatility characteristics and it obviously has the best monetary characteristics. I do think that it\u2019s gonna be another way that proves out the value of Bitcoin as this base monetary asset.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [58:29]: So, taking that as a given then, is there an implication there in terms of the kinds of software and Bitcoin wallets that people should be using? One example I can think of right now, Blockstream Green: you can have liquid Tether on there and you can have Bitcoin on there. Is that a scenario that might play out over the next few years, where there might be some people who come into just having some Tethers in a phone wallet, and then eventually they start seeing, obviously, Number go Up, and then they start thinking, Oh! Hey! Why am I holding this USD Tether thing, I can hold some Bitcoin as well! Do you see that as a plausible story? Or as a potential method that software and Bitcoin wallets should be built out in?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter [59:15]: Well, I\u2019m not gonna prescribe any behavior to wallet developers. They definitely understand their users far better than I do. But there is something very convenient about multi-asset wallets, especially Blockstream Green \u2014 great, great example. I hear Liquid mentioned all the time in terms of more sophisticated, complex smart contracts on Bitcoin. I expect that some of the first stablecoins issued against Bitcoin will be Liquid assets, that exist on the Liquid sidechain. I also think we\u2019re gonna get a flavor of wallets that give you options in terms of de-risking your Bitcoin position, so maybe you\u2019ll be able to flip a switch and change your Bitcoin position to being market-neutral, and effectively flat in dollar terms. And maybe behind the scenes, there\u2019s some complicated on-chain derivative transaction that is going 1x short on that Bitcoin, and so you\u2019ve created an effective stablecoin against Bitcoin collateral. Those are the kind of things that are possible with more development, especially in the DLC space. I think Taproot is also gonna give us some more tools to do this. I don\u2019t know exactly what it\u2019s gonna look like, but I have no doubt in my mind that smart developers are gonna figure this out and we\u2019re gonna have a much broader arsenal of risk-management products that are native, on-chain, Bitcoin-based, and trust-minimized.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:00:46]: Yeah that\u2019s a really interesting vision that we might see with a kind of Bitcoin DLC wallet enabled vision there. Or a similar idea I guess. One other topic that I think we obviously should hit as well, which is stablecoin regulation. Recently there was this whole blow-up on Twitter about the Stable Act. Can you tell us a little about, first of all, what is that, and then what was your reaction to that?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: There\u2019s a lot of interpretations and authors of the Stable Act have done themselves no favors by spouting off on Twitter which really muddied the waters, honestly. The Stable Act at its core basically says: stablecoin issuers need banking licences to operate. And their interpretation of stablecoins is that, these issuers are engaged in a banking depository style activity, and as such, they should be regulated by the state as banks. And anybody that understands what it\u2019s like to get a bank charter knows that this is an absurd proposition, because bank charters are incredibly difficult to come by, they require something like $20 million in paid up capital. Nobody gets bank charters anymore, at least in the US. The number of banks that exist just continues to decline year after year, and there\u2019s really been a stark decline in the number of banks in the US over the last 40 years. What this really is, is an attempt to nationalize a private sector industry which has been doing really well! And I\u2019m ultimately sympathetic to the core idea, which is: fiat-backed stablecoins should be more transparent about their reserve quality, and they should give depositors assurances that the stablecoins are actually backed on a one-to-one basis with actual dollars in a bank account. I\u2019m totally sympathetic to that idea, and it should be the case that there is some mechanism for them to prove that. I would be in favor of something like the FinTech charter \u2014 which Brian Brooks proposed \u2014 which would be a modified bank charter which takes note of the idiosyncrasies of the FinTech provider. Or something like an expansion of the special purposed despository institution, which is really suited for stablecoins. SPDIs in Wyoming, they are only entitled to hold a full reserve of the asset that they\u2019re custodying, so they can\u2019t operate fractionally. That\u2019s kind of what a stablecoin is! Stablecoins are meant to not be fractionally reserved, they\u2019re meant to be fully reserved. So there are a lot of interesting proposals for alternative bank charters. But the problem with the Stable bill is that it was just trying to treat these things like actual, regular commercial banks that engage in maturity transformation and engage in lending, and are heavily regulated as a consequence. But stablecoin issuers don\u2019t do any of this stuff! They just immobilize deposits in commercial banks and they issue IOUs that circulate on-chain against those deposits that are convertible for them. So the instrument that is being proposed\u2014as the solution to this issue of auditability \u2014 is an incredibly blunt and ill-fitting one, in my opinion. So that\u2019s the problem with the act, in my opinion. It takes this really archaic view of stablecoin issuers as banks, and tries to force them into this template, which basically makes no sense.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:04:26]: Yeah. And so it seems that the creators of that, and the advisors of that maybe, are not as familiar with how Bitcoin and this world works. But from what I\u2019ve also read of the analysis from Coin Center and also Preston Byrne\u2019s analysis, it seems as though this particular bill is unlikely to actually get passed and become law, but it seems that this is now the \u2014 they\u2019re on this path and they\u2019ll probably keep trying, won\u2019t they?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: The odds of any proposed bill of being passed is vanishingly low so you do have to contextualize it and look at, Well where are we in the cycle? What\u2019s the political trends here at play? Currently we actually have a split chamber, right? The Senate is Republican, and the House is Democratic, so I doubt there\u2019d be bipartisan unity on this topic. And also we have allies in the Senate and the House now. I think it\u2019d be unlikely for something like this would pass now. It\u2019s actually more broad-reaching in the language in the bill than just stablecoins. It would actually affect FinTech providers like Venmo, PayPal, any e-wallet where you can hold a balance. They would all be considered stablecoins under this bill, which is preposterous! It\u2019s an abuse of language! Nobody refers to those things as stablecoins. You don\u2019t say, Send me a $10 stablecoin transaction on Venmo, you just ask for your friend to Venmo you. The bill is authored in such a way that it would actually captural all of this activity under a broad net so it\u2019s just a poorly constructed bill.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:06:16]: I think some of the other lawyers in this space have spoken about how there are already a range of compliance issues with some of these stablecoins anyway, so if government and regulatory agencies wanted to come after them, they could use the already existing laws and try to clamp down in those ways, and apply other kinds of AML whitelisting or other kinds of controls, or try to force that square peg into the round hole, couldn\u2019t they?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah we don\u2019t necessarily need new laws on stablecoins. Although various legislative bodies are proposing them, not just in the US. I would say it would be welcome to have a specific kind of bank charter, which would be useful, which would suit stablecoin issuers. Because right now the way they\u2019re regulated is: they register as money services businesses with FinCEN, and that gives them obligations around money laundering, AML and KYC, and then they typically have to go after money transfer licences in a bunch of states. And that is not a homogenous regime. The process of getting those licences on a state by state basic is pretty onerous and the states aren\u2019t necessarily the best regulator for what those issuers are doing. In my view stablecoins are effectively narrow bank or money market mutual funds. They should probably be regulated as such. Look, I\u2019m not calling for more regulation, but if there is a regulatory instrument that\u2019s created, it should just be mindful of the way they actually operate and not treat them as banks, which they really are not!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:08:09]: Stepping back a little bit more broad: what\u2019s your view on stablecoins over the next 5 years? Do you think they\u2019re gonna wax and wane through these cycles? But it sounds to me like your view is fundamentally bullish stablecoins, but in a way that\u2019s also bullish Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Well the demand for stablecoins has obviously been proved out this year. I mean we went from $4 billion in outstanding stablecoin float to start the year to $25 billion today, which is just unbelievable! It\u2019s just unbelievable! I mean, those numbers in any other context outside the crypto industry would be eye-watering. So there\u2019s no question that people want dollar-denominated liquidity on largely censor-resistant blockchain rails on a globalized format such that you can hold those coins in your own possession with a private key. So digital bearer assets, cash-like digital bearer assets, there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there\u2019s huge demand in the world for that. Now the big, big question is, is the hammer gonna fall on the likes of Tether and maybe even USDC and all the other issuers? Are the regulators gonna get their way and come down on the issuers? If that\u2019s the case, the only stablecoins that\u2019ll be left will be the crypto-collaterized stablecoins like DAI, which are much harder to regulate against, because they are just created through smart contracts, as opposed to traditional commercial bank relationships. So there\u2019s one scenario where, there are adverse regulatory outcomes for stablecoin issuers, and the only model that really survives is the crypto-collateralized model. And then there\u2019s another scenario where stablecoin issuers continue to exist in this grey zone, and continue to be reasonably private and reasonably censor-resistant albeit not perfectly so, and they just keep growing. But I do wonder what is the end state of that? The only thing that constrains their capacity is the balance sheet of the commercial banks that are holding the reserves. But that is almost unbounded. So what happens if you get to $200 billion in stablecoin prefloat? There\u2019s probably a point where it becomes systemic and where bank regulators worldwide try to triangulate the banks that are holding reserves for these things. So I don\u2019t think that it can grow indefinitely. I do think that there is a Sword of Damocles hanging over at least the stablecoin industry in its current format, absent of any regulatory clarity. I don\u2019t have a firm answer on it, but I do feel that we\u2019re waiting for a hammer to fall which hasn\u2019t fallen yet! I don\u2019t know what form it\u2019s gonna take. I don\u2019t think Tether for instance can exist sustainably for the next 5 years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera [1:11:17]: I see. So the fiat backed stablecoin phenomenon may be a short or medium term one. And then potentially maybe putting on the optimistic for Bitcoin hat, people work on some kind of DLC version of a Bitcoin stablecoin, and then, if there\u2019s a crackdown from a regulatory view on the fiat-backed stablecoin style, maybe that\u2019s the stress to the system that causes the adaptation of the Bitcoin style stablecoin?"}
{"prompt": "Nic Carter: Yeah that\u2019s very well put. I think that\u2019s very, very plausible. I do think that the more truly cypherpunk stablecoins that are issued in smart contract form against liability free collateral \u2014 those are the best ones! Those are the most robust ones. And they\u2019re the ones that are most likely to last the longest. The fiat backed ones are fragile, so they can pop out of existence at any minute. Regardless of the regulatory winds at play, we\u2019re gonna figure out how to create stablecoins on top of Bitcoin, and I think they\u2019re gonna be a hit, honestly! I think they\u2019re gonna be a hit! So I\u2019m pretty excited to see how developers figure out how to do that!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Stephan Livera: Fantastic!

I think it\u2019s a great article. One of the things that really stuck to me, though, that just kind of stuck out that I\u2019ve been thinking about, is the notion that you said, You know, sometimes, people don\u2019t want to hear from me when I step out of my \u201clane\u201d. In terms of my job or my career. And I get what you\u2019re saying there, especially when it comes to Bitcoin.

Does it make sense? And how are they coming to their conclusions? When people just throw out random crap at you, it\u2019s not always easy to tell if they even know what they\u2019re talking about. Especially on Twitter. When people want to get into arguments, sometimes they don\u2019t have any substance behind what they\u2019re saying. So if you can draw out some substance and find out how they come to their conclusions and there\u2019s logic back there, I\u2019m willing to listen.

Before we dig in to some of these more current events, I really want to put in front\u2014highlight this article. It\u2019s really amazing when you come into the Bitcoin space and there\u2019s so many different articles and pieces and they all really carry a lot of weight. I mean, Bitcoiners really, they speak their truth and they all have a different perspective. And I love this perspective and it really helped me think through when I compare Bitcoin to buying real estate in Manhattan in the 1970\u2019s. I\u2019ll say something to my father now \u2014 I\u2019ll be like, Bitcoin is like buying real estate in Manhattan in the 70's! And he\u2019s like, Who wouldn\u2019t buy real estate in Manhattan in the 70's? And I was like, Well, you! You know, because back in the 70\u2019s it was not the place to put your money. But those people had a vision, and they seized that opportunity. And I love this article. This is one of the quotes: \u201cImagine you had the opportunity to purchase 1,100 acres of land for approximately $9,000?\u201d Can you just tell us a little bit about what motivated you to write this article?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim [04:05]: Yeah, sure. I\u2019m gonna have to give credit to our missing patriarch, Trace Mayer, who\u2019s been disappeared since February, but he used to talk about the Bitcoin blockchain as real estate. And that you should get some of your own, some of this limited real estate. And then it just was a natural progression in my own mind. You know, So how much real estate in the Bitcoin blockchain is available to each person if it was cut up equally? That was my first thought and I said, Oh, that seems like some relatively easy math if I go get some numbers on about how many people are around, we could divide that into 21 million in Bitcoin times a hundred-million sub-units that we call satoshis. And so how much does each person get? It was two-hundred and some-odd thousand\u2014I\u2019m not the only person that came up with the number very close to that. Certainly, what number you use for total population is gonna make that vary a little bit. So I went to a bunch of websites to see if I could get some kind of an average. And then you can do the same thing with real estate. Basically you can look around and there have been plenty of people who have tried to map out, How much usable land is on the planet versus how much total land? How much is it used for farming, whatever. I tried to whittle it down to just the usable land that we have available to us as humans, whether it be for farming or for living, versus mountains and swamps that we can\u2019t do much with. So you get another number, you divide that by the amount of people that are out there and you say, Okay, well how much land would each person get if you cut it up equally? I forget the number, I\u2019d have to skim the article again. But I spent plenty of time checking my numbers. I ran the numbers Pierre! Just in case. [05:49] It\u2019s basic math, and so I tried lay it out in such a way that anybody can follow it, they can pretty much check, in the online version of the article, there\u2019s a hyperlink you can click on and see where I got my facts from. But it was quite interesting, I\u2019m looking at it now\u2014I pulled it up on another screen \u2014 231,000 satoshis per person! Based on 7.79 billion people on the planet. Depending on what 1 satoshi is worth, that could be a lot! You know, I like to think of satoshis as dollars. And $231,000 for everybody, that\u2019s a lot of wealth to work with \u2014 assuming it could buy what a dollar buys today. Yeah I just kept taking that example, that base example, and extrapolating it out to different things. The quote that you brought up was, If you took your fair share of Bitcoin but multiplied that out to what would one whole Bitcoin get you in equal amount of real estate, I think that\u2019s where you came up with \u2014 at the time the Bitcoin price was $9,000 \u2014 1,800 acres. It was a lot of acres of real estate for $9,000. Most people on the planet would buy that much real estate for $9,000 if they could, except, there are places in the world where that much real estate\u2019s not even worth $9,000. But we\u2019re talking about valuable real estate that people want. [07:08] And so, if you were giving that up to me\u2014I guess that\u2019s what you were bringing up. I hadn\u2019t thought of real estate in the 70\u2019s in Manhattan. But when nobody really wanted it, because it was a beat-up city, you could get this stuff relatively cheap. You could extrapolate that out to Bitcoin, because we\u2019ve got a beat-up protocol \u2014 beat up by the media, let\u2019s say, that\u2019s working pretty good. People just don\u2019t wanna look at it! And you can get a piece of this stuff! It\u2019s going somewhere, folks! You just gotta get a little piece! It might turn out really well! Had I been in a position to purchase Manhattan real estate in the 70's \u2014 I was too young \u2014 but, had I understood the things I understand now I probably would\u2019ve tried to buy some. We gotta scarce resource here. There\u2019s only so much of it. If you can get yourself one Bitcoin, that\u2019s like \u2014 that\u2019s hard to fathom what that could represent in terms of the value, your purchasing power, in a hyperbitcoinization world, or a world where Bitcoin is the money that everybody uses. [08:08] As I said, if you have 231,000 satoshis \u2014 your fair share \u2014 and they\u2019re each worth a dollar, but you had one full Bitcoin? That\u2019s $100,000,000! So that\u2019s like the equivalent of you, right now, let\u2019s just say you had $100,000,000 \u2014 yeah, you\u2019d be doing pretty good! And you\u2019d be doing better than most people on the planet, alright? There\u2019s not that many people who have that much money. So, yeah this Bitcoin thing. It really fascinated me, and it just kept gnawing at me, these concepts, until I just kept \u2014 I would write a little bit, type a little bit on my computer, and then one day I put it into a Tweetstorm. That\u2019s what I actually did first. In 2018 I linked up ten Tweets in a row with this idea. And then when I saw Citadel 21 was asking for articles, and I thought, You know? I could turn that into an article pretty easy. So that\u2019s what I did, and @hodlonaut was nice enough to publish it for me. So that\u2019s the basic story there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [08:57]: Yeah! And I love when you break it down to like, It\u2019s beer money! You know, you can get these 231,000 satoshis for like \u2014 now, the price has gone up a little bit \u2014 maybe $35? $30? And then you start thinking about, What if you did that every week? It\u2019s like buying a skyscraper in Manhattan in 1972 for $10,000! And maybe not having a tenant right away. It really helped me outline this argument when I talk to people about the asymmetric bet, and try to equate it to what you were saying with Trace. I remember those conversations where, You\u2019re buying a piece of the network. You own this real estate on the network. Because it\u2019s yours until you move it, or use your key to release it."}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim [09:49]: Right. It\u2019s a scarce amount. There\u2019s only so much, and if you can get a piece of it, and other people are gonna want some of this real estate in the future, then you have a little bit of leverage there. You have some value there that people want and you could use that to live off of, to trade for things. The whole point of money is to store value, and this Bitcoin blockchain that was invented, stores value pretty well so far. And there\u2019s only so much of it that you can have available to store that value, and so if you get a piece of it \u2014 yeah it\u2019s an interesting concept: I heard people discuss squeezing more value into Bitcoin. At first I couldn\u2019t understand what that actually meant. So you\u2019ve got these 21 million Bitcoin, each one of \u2019em breaks up into 100,000,000 smaller units, and so, the value of any one of those units can be worth any amount of money. It\u2019s all what we decide to put on it, as far as value. So, how does it get value? Somebody has one of these Bitcoin, and somebody else says, I got this, and I\u2019ll give it to you. So typically that\u2019s dollars or Yen \u2014 some other form of money that the person who has the Bitcoin can go and use it for something. So [if] the person that has the Bitcoin feels that the dollars they\u2019re getting are worth it right now, because I need those dollars, I gotta go spend \u2019em on something \u2014 let me give up this Bitcoin because it\u2019s a good amount in exchange for maybe what I paid for it. Then the exchange goes through! Now, if not enough people recognize that value, they\u2019re not gonna trade. If they think their Bitcoin\u2019s worth more, they\u2019re gonna hold onto it. So now the next person comes along and says, Hey I wanna get some of that Bitcoin stuff, I\u2019ll give you a little more! Because there\u2019s only so many of \u2019em around, and so this is the market that we\u2019re watching now: it\u2019s expanding, as more and more people want little pieces of this scarce pie of digital real estate. They have to bid the price up because the people that have it aren\u2019t so willing to give it up anymore! They\u2019re starting to come to the realization that it\u2019s been working for 12 years straight. As a money it works really well in terms of storing value and transferring value around the world. We\u2019ve talked \u2014 I know you\u2019ve had many people on your podcast talk about the aspects of money that make a good money. Portability, divisibility, fungibility, verifiability, scarcity. So Bitcoin has all those things better than any other money we\u2019ve seen on the planet and people are waking up to that. They\u2019re starting to see: Wow! This thing has these properties and it\u2019s been working and it\u2019s pretty secure and there\u2019s a lot of people that are not only working on it and believed in it, but defend it. You know, you and I are considered some of the cyber hornets and we attack when people try to tell us we don\u2019t know what we\u2019re talking about. Michael Saylor seems to feel that the community of cyber hornets are one of the white blood cells of this whole system. It\u2019s what keeps it working. We are defending this thing to the death! So much so that we\u2019ll do anything to keep it running! Whatever it means\u2014fix the code, create hardware wallets, create things that we call multisig, which is ways to use this protocol more efficiently, better for people, giving it more value. This is constantly happening every single day by tens of thousands of people all over the world that are not going to quit on this thing! [13:28] And Michael Saylor sees that and he goes, What a crazy ecosystem building around this digital protocol that was invented! It\u2019s absolutely fascinating! And it really is. This new invention, this new form of money that we\u2019ve taken to, that works so well \u2014 each little unit is become worth more and more and more! And you\u2019ve just gotta get your little tiny sliver, and it\u2019s very likely it\u2019s gonna go up! And while you brought up the beer money thing, my calculations at that time were basically, you needed about $20.79 to get your fair of Bitcoin. And that was when it was about $9,000 for a whole Bitcoin. And so I thought of that as beer money for\u2014not a heavy drinker. If it was a heavy drinker it would be more than that! But and I went out and I said, Okay, what if Bitcoin cost $10,000? What would it cost you \u2014 your fair share? Easy math: 23 cents. What if it was $20,000? $46.20. What if it was $1,000,000? What would your fair share \u2014 if the entire Bitcoin blockchain is divided amongst everybody on the planet \u2014 what would it cost you to get your fair share at $1,000,000 per Bitcoin? [14:35] And the number\u2019s only $2,310.65! Now, that\u2019s a number that almost anybody can divert out of their life. I mean, where I live in New York, most people make reasonable money \u2014 sure, there\u2019s very poor people on the planet that can\u2019t afford that, but my point is this: even at $1,000,000 per Bitcoin it\u2019s worth getting some! Right? Because it\u2019s just gonna keep going up! I wanted to extrapolate on this, which I did not do in the article. I have this other article in my head just based on the concept of Number go Up. And I\u2019m convinced that the value of Bitcoin\u2014if it maintains itself as a worldwide money \u2014 will never stop going up! And the basic premise behind my position is this: when you look around at the Earth, there\u2019s more value currently on this Earth than there ever was, ever. Listen to somebody like Jeff Booth, he\u2019ll tell you about how technology\u2019s deflationary, business owners are always trying to improve their efficiency, improve their profits. In a world that has sound money \u2014 not corrupt money like we have now \u2014 capitalism can flourish. So value is created when people can take their labor and natural resources and turn them into something. And somebody else does the same thing with their labor and natural resources and turns them into something. And then they find this medium in the middle that they can exchange with each other\u2014this thing called money\u2014and then, what you find is that through efficiencies and use of trade, the division of labor, humans are able to cumulatively continue to put more value on the Earth. [16:22] Now, if Bitcoin is the unit of currency that is needed to denominate all that value, someday, everything is priced in Bitcoin. And [if] the value of items on the planet continues to grow, but the supply of Bitcoin does not, then the value of every Bitcoin must always go up. It literally has to go up. It can\u2019t go any other direction unless we destroy \u2014 if we have a net negative amount of new value on the planet. So, we\u2019re destroying things all the time, but we\u2019re also producing more things at the same time. So if we\u2019re having a net destruction of value\u2014yes, the value of Bitcoin could go down. In a market where all of Bitcoin is as distributed as it\u2019s gonna be at any given moment\u2014let\u2019s say after 2140 when it\u2019s all been spit out of the system \u2014 now it has to find its way into the hands of other people. They have to trade for value to the people who have the Bitcoin \u2014 that form of money, right? So now it starts to get dispersed all over the world. [17:20] The amount of value on the planet continues to rise, indirectly! It\u2019s kind of the opposite of inflation, in the sense that, when they keep printing money, the value of your labor goes down\u2014 you need more money to buy things. In this case, you\u2019ll need less Bitcoin to buy things, because the value of each Bitcoin goes up relative to your labor. So, your labor becomes more valuable over time, and you need less of it to buy things, because the value of your money goes up. So it\u2019s so connected to productivity of human beings, but it\u2019s also very connected to the world having the ability to use a freely chosen market money that\u2019s not imposed on people by government. Because the reason we don\u2019t have real capitalism \u2014 we have crony capitalism \u2014 the reason we have those types of things is because government have taken control of the money and it\u2019s basically broken, and some people win and a lot of people lose. [18:17] I was thinking of another thing, I don\u2019t mean to skip around. When the government gets involved in stuff, which they fully have done this year with the whole COVID thing, they skew the real market, and resources get diverted in directions they never would\u2019ve got diverted. So, for example, there is an entire industry created around the building and distribution of masks \u2014 all over the planet! So if you are able to take advantage of that \u2014 you\u2019re in the clothing industry, or some other industry \u2014 you could just turn your production facility into something that builds masks, and package them and send them out and get them out there as fast as possible, you could take advantage of a government mandate that everybody felt that they had to go buy one and wear it! Now, the market did not want that! People did not ask for masks, they were told they had to wear them. The government created an artificial market, and resources \u2014 actual money, productivity, that people would\u2019ve went and bought movie tickets, or went and played golf, or bought themselves a nice steak\u2014they had to go buy some masks for their whole family, because the government screwed them over and skewed the free market. You can\u2019t do that when you can\u2019t control the money. When you can control the money, you can control people, you can control regulations, you control the police forces and the militaries that uphold all the rules that you decide, or your decrees on the rest of the populous. Yeah, it\u2019s terrible! Everything is messed up because money is broken. Everything gets fixed when Bitcoin is the money of the world. That\u2019s why we have the meme, Bitcoin Fixes This. But, I also believe Number goes Up is a very valid meme, because I do think Bitcoin\u2019s value will never stop going up!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [19:56]: Yeah. So as we wait for Bitcoin to take over the world, what do you think is going on right now? If the governments can print money, and they can control people, what is happening right now in this moment? Is this happenstance? Things are out of control? Are we being taken advantage of? I just want to hear your thoughts?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: So yeah, I didn\u2019t see any of this growing up. Well, I was a bit of a rebel my whole life, so I didn\u2019t really like a lot of rules, especially the ones that didn\u2019t seem logical to me. But I did believe in government and the state and I used to vote and I used to think it all made a lot of sense. Until I got educated, and a lot of that education came to me after I found Bitcoin. One of the things I came to realize is Bitcoin is a type of truth, and you can\u2019t\u2014well let me back up again. Part of my upbringing is to take things apart, I want to see how things work. And in physics, in engineering and natural sciences, you don\u2019t get to dictate certain principles. They\u2019re just there! You have to work with them all the time. And so, I became aware of certain universal things about life, and whenever something didn\u2019t seem to make sense, I\u2019d want to get to the bottom of, How do you come to this conclusion on any given thing? And so Bitcoin is the kind of thing, when you study it, the logic is there, the mechanism of how it works and the game theory about why people are willing to always act in the right way to keep the system working. That stuff was really fascinating to me! What\u2019s going on in the world with governments deciding what to do, they\u2019re not following basic logic, basic first principles \u2014 it\u2019s so corrupted, that they control the money, that they can create situations that benefit some people over other people, and I think Bitcoin takes that away from them. If, in fact, we ever get to a point where Bitcoin is a world money. They can\u2019t make more of it and they can\u2019t pay off their crony friends and everything else. I\u2019m not sure if I answered your question directly enough, I\u2019m not quite sure exactly how you phrased it. I apologize.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [22:13]: No, that was great. What do you think of the recent elections, and what they mean for us as [inaudible]?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: Nothing. Dog and pony show. Now, they\u2019re both on the same team. They\u2019re on Team Corruption, Team Politics. They\u2019re not working for us. They both spew out a lot of platitudes to try and keep people in line, keep people Rah-rah! We\u2019re all in this together! But we\u2019re not! They\u2019re on one side. They\u2019re in the political elite, and we\u2019re not. They\u2019re not our friends. They just want us to think they are.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [22:45]: Yeah I kind of take the same thought, that 400\u2013500 families run the country, and it is a fight that they\u2019re just trying to drive through us, and not really against themselves. But what do you think that that\u2019s about? What do we do in this moment then?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: To answer both questions, what it\u2019s about is the money \u2014 it\u2019s always been about the money. Once central banking was invented, I think in the 1600s, those people that were involved never stopped being involved. Their heirs and the people that were close to them kept central banking going as a concept. Ever since it was invented, it was enslaving humans. The people that run all the banks in the world are the people in control. They\u2019re in control of all the politicians. The politicians do not control the money. The money controllers control the money. So, this is literally what\u2019s going on: it\u2019s a select handful of humans that run this planet because they control money, and they control all the people who distribute the money, protect the money \u2014 all of that. So whether it\u2019s 400 families in this country or around the world, it\u2019s a select few, and all the people that have sworn their allegiance to those select few, this is why the cover-ups \u2014 you know, all the politicians, they all have dirt on each other. Hillary\u2019s never getting prosecuted. She\u2019s amongst some of the worst politicians we\u2019ve ever seen, in my opinion. But, you know, Donald will say how she\u2019s evil and this, that, and the other thing, but you just watch: he won\u2019t prosecute her. Biden certainly won\u2019t. She\u2019ll just keep going. None of \u2018em! None of \u2019em will! We\u2019ll never find out what happened to Jeffrey Epstein. No chance. None of the people are ever getting prosecuted, because it\u2019s a big club! And they control the media. The media gets paid off from very wealthy people, that\u2019s how they get their advertising. It\u2019s just a big money stream, and as soon as you take that power away from them, it just fizzles away. I wouldn\u2019t say for a long time. This is a couple generation thing that\u2019s gonna have to play out. They\u2019re not gonna give up easily, and there\u2019s a lot of people that benefit \u2014 even innocent people that benefit by the system that\u2019s been built. All the police and military, they get paid very well with all kinds of great benefits, are not necessarily trying to take over their fellow man. Some of them, you know, abuse their situation. They just want a good job with good pay, and they believe, they\u2019ve been indoctrinated to believe that this whole system is created to help everybody and protect everybody. Meanwhile, the politicians keep writing rules\u2014words on paper \u2014 that take more of our freedoms away, and these police that are being told by their immediate superiors and the ones over them and the ones over them, you must enforce these words on paper that we\u2019ve come up with. That\u2019s what this is all about! We\u2019re helping everybody! The sad part is, you just gotta look back in history. It\u2019s playing out, it\u2019s a broken record: you know, every dictator, every socialist communist regime, did the same thing. It\u2019s all for your protection. If everybody had guns it would be very dangerous. Therefore, everybody should not have guns. I mean, it\u2019s a joke! But they\u2019re trying it here in America. It\u2019s an interesting experiment, because in all other cases, citizenry of most other countries did not have huge amounts of weaponry to fight back with. This country is starting out \u2014 or at least, in this iteration of this country \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of weaponry out there to fight back against any form of state that might try to impose too much will on the people. I\u2019m shocked at all the people that walked around this entire country with masks everywhere! Like literally, it\u2019s like, Ah, it\u2019s too much of a hassle to fight, I don\u2019t want to get my whole town to rally up and fight against this, so I\u2019ll just put on a mask. That\u2019s really sad, because that just shows how far the state has come with its ability to indoctrinate, to convince people to act in ways that they would not otherwise act, and what do they say? Well it\u2019s for the benefit of our neighbors! We gotta protect the elderly! You gotta help everybody! Yeah, okay, I\u2019m not in favor of ruining other peoples\u2019 lives, but I\u2019m also not in favor of you telling me how I should live my life. Or anybody else, for that matter. I think everyone should decide for themselves, take their own risks. Life is full of risks. That\u2019s never going away. Politicians can\u2019t make it go away. So everybody has to decide for themselves if they wanna take a risk. Decide for yourself if you believe these politicians that this virus is really dangerous, or go somewhere else and find somebody else that\u2019s telling you maybe it\u2019s not so dangerous. There\u2019s enough people on the Internet you can listen to that totally contradict the government\u2019s narrative. They\u2019re just not getting on the mainstream news. They\u2019re not getting on the TV, where the general public gets most of their information. So, most of society stays brainwashed, but plenty of people don\u2019t believe any of this! I have not believed it from the very beginning. This is just a big ruse to me. This flu thing, it\u2019s just maybe a slightly stronger version \u2014 I don\u2019t know. But when 99.95% of the people recover \u2014 no matter how sick they get \u2014 I don\u2019t know how you could tell me that the entire society needs to get locked down. Everybody needs to wear masks, and businesses being destroyed. All of the planet, for a virus that kills almost no one! This is absolute insanity! And yet, people still believe it! They still believe we need masks! It\u2019s absolute craziness! I know you commented on a Tweet I sent out \u2014 I was in New York City. [27:48] They\u2019re building little huts in the street! Because people aren\u2019t allowed in the building to eat dinner, but they can sit in a box in the street and eat the same dinner \u2014 what the hell? What is going on with the minds of people? How the hell \u2014 I can\u2019t fathom. There\u2019s no logic! There\u2019s no fricking logic, okay? I can\u2019t believe people. If I can\u2019t see the logic to it, then I\u2019m not going with you on this, I\u2019m sorry! So I was willing to consider at the beginning, it might be a dangerous virus. You saw video out of China, people falling all over in the streets, welding doors shut\u2014which is insanity to me \u2014 and I thought, Oh, man, that better not come here. Luckily, it hasn\u2019t. But I said, Alright, maybe it\u2019s bad. But even from the very beginning, the first week or two, when I was forced out of work, I thought, No way! And I work in a place that has no people around most of the time. So I thought, Now this is bullshit! This government, this little township that I work in, had the ability to close down the entire town and not let a single person work, in wintertime when most people are not there. It would be me and my crew on a job site, nobody around for miles potentially, and I\u2019m not allowed to go to work because some government bureaucrat deems the entire environment dangerous or some \u2014 who knows what? It\u2019s insanity! [29:03] And I started just immediately doing searches online. I gotta find out more myself, Is anybody saying anything other than the stupid government narrative? And immediately, there\u2019s answers everywhere! Scientists all over the planet that would refute everything Fauci tells you on the TV, or any of these other bureaucratic pencil-pushers. It\u2019s just too much to stomach. Look, I can ramble, my mind just goes in all directions. I hope I\u2019m hitting the things you wanted to get to.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah! You are! And we\u2019re gonna get to more. I love it. Let\u2019s stipulate that government controls the money, governments can do these things to people, and influence events. Let\u2019s compare this current environment to maybe Vietnam. Because it kind of came up on the show with JW Weatherman, and it took me a moment to think about this. Let\u2019s say that this is government overreach. And that it\u2019s horrible. But government has always overreached, maybe? I think that\u2019s an argument that I would stand by, and maybe Vietnam or Iraq or Afghanistan, or any of those things were overreach. [30:12] But then, you had to go to a foreign land and kill somebody. So just in terms of the lesser of two evils, which is not the road that I want to go down, but\u2014Is this worse? Better? Is this a different form of psychological warfare that is worse? Is it not as bad as getting a letter when you\u2019re 18 and having to go to another country to kill somebody, but bad in a different way? I\u2019m just trying to get some grounding for what 2020 is. I mean, I\u2019ve been fighting it all year\u2014to think of 2020 as the worst year of my life \u2014 because I want every year to be the best year of my life, and get better. So I\u2019m an optimist, and I\u2019ve been trying not to let it get me down or really get caught up in it. But then I take a moment back to when JW said, At least we\u2019re not going back to Vietnam and killing people \u2014 it really struck me as, Yeah! This is a really different year! But, how different, and on what level, and is it a lesser evil or a greater evil?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim [31:13]: Oh, okay. So, part of me wants to say it\u2019s a greater evil, because it\u2019s getting right into the brains of everybody in a way that \u2014 you know, it\u2019s one thing to believe in war in a foreign land, and for people to want to support their country, believing that they\u2019re fighting for freedom or democracy or whatever they think is some type of virtue that they believe they should go and fight for. But you don\u2019t have to brainwash everybody \u2014 well maybe you do, I don\u2019t know. Something about this scares me a little more. You know, like, I\u2019m gonna tell you about the Vietnam \u2014 you brought that up, I find that interesting that you should bring that up. I can vividly remember sitting on the front steps of my house growing up with my mother, and I was nine, and the Vietnam War was going, and I had heard about it and I didn\u2019t understand it, and I started asking her questions about it, like, Why do we have to do this? Why are people dying? Why are we way on the other side of the planet? [32:20] What\u2019s up with Vietnam? Why is that important to us? And she her best to answer my questions, and then we got up to talking about the draft. And I immediately, at nine years old, I\u2019m like, No way! There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going! Not a chance in the world! And I asked my mother, what could I do if they told me I had to go? And she told me, straight at me, You\u2019d probably have to go to Canada. That was the first time in my life I\u2019d ever thought, Move out of the country? What\u2019s Canada? How far is it? I didn\u2019t know anything about that! But, I thought, Well, Canada it is then, if that\u2019s all it takes! I\u2019m going to Canada, man! I\u2019m not going across the planet to go kill some strangers! Just fundamentally it didn\u2019t seem right! I was just a kid, but whatever. Like, to think my parents raised me well, I don\u2019t know! So yeah, I don\u2019t agree with any of this, what government can do \u2014 at this point \u2014 generations of indoctrination through public school systems. I stood there, pledged allegiance to the flag like every kid. It\u2019s hard to believe the indoctrination that you\u2019re put through in public school. [33:23] At the time, I didn\u2019t see it. Nobody did. But the indoctrination that comes from that, then through television and movies, Hollywood, the newpapers, the media in general, it\u2019s all skewed basically to keep you believing that authority is there, it matters, and you can\u2019t stop it and you must heed to it. That is, this big monstrosity called government, is never going away, it controls a lot of stuff, and it\u2019s in your best interest, so don\u2019t try to fight it, right? And it\u2019s a good thing! We all need to get in line and listen to the boss. In school, they made us line up to walk down the hallways. Somebody\u2019s always in charge. And there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that. It\u2019s the blind belief that you must listen to some person of authority no matter what they tell you! See, that\u2019s the difference. It\u2019s okay to listen to authority \u2014 I\u2019m an authority at work, I tell people what to do all the time. But it\u2019s in their economic best interest to listen to me because if they do what I\u2019m asking then they\u2019ll get paid! Do they have to care what I want? No, they don\u2019t have to care. They just have to execute what I want, in order to get paid. [34:31] So there\u2019s certain ways that authority is perfectly fine. But when somebody\u2019s telling you to live your life a certain way that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise choose to do, that\u2019s crossing the line. That\u2019s violating the Non-Aggression Principle. You\u2019re in there trying to tell somebody else what they have to do, or something. Ultimately, it\u2019s what they have to do. It\u2019s fine to make suggestions. It\u2019s when you force somebody to do anything. So the government have gotten people so convinced that they have to listen to authority that they\u2019re willing to go around and wear masks all over the place \u2014 some people in their own cars by themselves, driving! Like, Wow, man! Are they that afraid of the air around them? I\u2019m blown away by the brainwashing! How deep it\u2019s gone! And I can just imagine those bankers of the world\u2014sitting there \u2014 I can imagine the evil villain in Batman rubbing his hands together, just laughing, Ha ha ha ha! Look at them! Look at all those crazy idiots just doing what we say! It\u2019s mind-boggling to think how much power a handful of people have on everybody else. Mind-boggling, to me. But, it\u2019s all because they control the money. It all gets fixes when the money gets fixed, literally. [35:40]\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: When did you wake up to all this and gain your conviction?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: So I would say that\u2019s always been in me, and I uncovered it. So I said earlier that I\u2019ve been a bit of a rebel my whole life\u2014I\u2019ve never liked authority. I\u2019ve always hated the police. I always hated stupid rules. Like, if the playground was closed but nobody was there and it was a sunny day, I thought, Why can\u2019t we go in the playground? What the hell is the gate closed for? Why does that matter? It\u2019s a damn playground and no one is using it! I just couldn\u2019t relate to those kind of stupid rules all over the world around me! So, it really wasn\u2019t until Bitcoin, honestly, because once I started to connect how the money creates all the other bull-crap in the world \u2014 because that\u2019s really what it took for me. I saw so much illogical, unreasonable stuff going on, I never believed or trusted much of what governments said, anyway. But I did not understand how it got created, and how it\u2019s able to perpetuate, until I understood money. [36:46] And this is again\u2014it\u2019s very convenient how public school systems do not teach how money came about in human history, what different forms of money, views for why some were better than others \u2014 none of that was taught. So it was only because of Bitcoin that I was able to learn the history of money, and then start to have the courage to go back to see how money is so connected to all the other human problems we all face. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, a broken money is the reason why our societies are broken at every level. Why one religious states hates another. If we all had one money to work with and trade with each other, everybody would just go in their own corner and hang out with their own people, their own types of people, get along fine, I\u2019d go hang out with surfers, the skiers can go hang out with the skiers. Everybody would leave everybody alone, for the most part, if nobody had control over the economy. Like I said earlier, the government skews the free market, it puts incentives in place they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be in. So now, human beings gotta take their resources and divert them in ways they wouldn\u2019t otherwise do. And they\u2019re not always in their direct best interest. Sometimes they\u2019re doing it because the government\u2019s making them do it. I follow a lot of rules in the construction industry where I\u2019m at, and a lot of those rules cause extra costs. And some of those rules are reasonable, in the sense that they make a building safer or whatnot, but some of them are absolute bullshit all day long, and they just enrich one industry, or \u2014 just the idea that you have to get permission to build a house, so you gotta go pay somebody some money to say, Oh yeah, we\u2019ve looked at your plans, and we\u2019re gonna let you build it. Meanwhile, you own the land, and none of your neighbors seem to care, but you gotta go pay some money you wouldn\u2019t otherwise have to pay, to some other human being who has said \u2014 who has written words on paper \u2014 we get to control you and guess what? You only get to act if you pay us. [38:38] That is so broken! That is not how free people work! Again, I feel like I\u2019m going off on a tangent, but my mind just keeps going along.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: No, it\u2019s great! Yeah, I\u2019m looking to hear from your mind! I\u2019m curious, what was it that spoke to you clearly about Bitcoin in terms of like, was it a particular \u2014 and Bitcoin and money. Or reality. What were some of the things that crystallized it for you, whether it was Bitcoin or not?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: I\u2019ll tell you exactly. I had three touches. First touch was somebody told me about Bitcoin, a young guy I know, who is into gaming, he was talking about Internet money, I thought it had something to do with gaming. I wasn\u2019t into gaming, so I literally never even looked at it. Second time was going through Netflix on the TV, I saw a documentary on Bitcoin. I was curious, I like documentaries in general. So I watched it, but at the end of it, it looked a little too complicated and not necessarily going anywhere. I think that was about 2015. [39:38] But then I was walking my dog, listening to YouTube, I had figured out that, on YouTube, there is a lot of interesting information and went and got myself an unlimited data plan, so I can just listen to anything I want on YouTube and walk the dog, or wherever else I was going. And then I start to learn about YouTube and they feed you things, based on what you\u2019d listen to in the past. So they\u2019ll make suggestions. So I started listening to several different TED talks, and eventually I came across one, this woman was talking about\u2014it could have been about Bitcoin \u2014 but she connected with me because she related Bitcoin to trust. And I can\u2019t even tell you exactly how she described it, but it piqued my attention, because as I\u2019d referenced earlier, I work at a summer community on a barrier island called Fire Island. And when I\u2019m working there all winter long, the homeowners are nowhere to be found. And they have to trust me! And what I came to realize when I started my business over there\u2014with a perfectly clean slate and basically no reputation \u2014 was the fact that, if I do a good job, and build a level of trust with the first couple of customers, maybe they\u2019ll tell one of the people and I can build on that. But the thing is, you can never break that trust. You always have to come through. You make a mistake, you honestly own up to it, fix it, do whatever you gotta do, so that those people never lose trust in you, that they can be away from their project, and you can do it without cutting corners and screwing them over. And I learned it by asking people, How did you come to meet? What happened to your last contract? And one woman in particular told me a story where a contractor said that a job was done in the spring, sending the balance, anticipating he would get back to finish it before she showed up, and she showed up and it wasn\u2019t really done. So he lied to her, he got paid, and then he had to, you know, make up some excuse and come back and then she was like, I\u2019m never hiring you again! So I learned this thing about trust very early on when I was trying to get my business off the ground, that you cannot mess with this thing called trust. Now when this lady connected Bitcoin with trust, I had to know why she meant that. I wanted to know what was this thing\u2014Bitcoin, why was it so tied to trust?\u2014that had piqued my interest, and what could that mean to me? And I had already learned enough about it, I had watched the documentary, I understood it to be some digital money. But I didn\u2019t recognize the trust component of it, and so really was what sent me down the rabbit hole. [42:02] That caused me to now search out podcasts of anything Bitcoin, so I could learn, How does it work? And what is it about trusting or not trusting that\u2019s going on here? And so we have that saying in Bitcoin, Don\u2019t trust, verify. The idea is that you don\u2019t trust anybody in Bitcoin. She was talking about it in a way that you could transfer money basically without having to trust that the money wasn\u2019t going to show up, or anybody in the middle was gonna steal it. She was trying to reference the fact that, once you understand how the Bitcoin blockchain works, it\u2019s very trustable. But you don\u2019t have to trust somebody telling you that. The good thing about Bitcoin is that it\u2019s open source and if you don\u2019t know how to read code, you can go learn to read code. You could hire someone that could read code. You could eventually get to the bottom line of Bitcoin and decide for yourself if you should trust it. That\u2019s what got to me \u2014 as I was learning about Bitcoin, I recognized that, you know, I can\u2019t read code, so I can stay for the rest of my life not trusting this protocol. Or, I could learn as much can about it that I can understand, then trust other people who have studied it, if I so choose to. And so one podcast, one interview after another, one article after another, I came to a belief that enough people have tested this stuff that don\u2019t have any skin in the game to tell me otherwise \u2014 they\u2019re not trying to sell me anything! They\u2019re not getting my money to convince me to jump into this thing! There is so much content, I was very fortunate because this was early 2017. There was already a good enough amount of content that I could cross-check one podcaster after another, and see, What is this guy saying? What is that guy saying? And I got to look back at videos from the early days of Bitcoin from 2012 and 2013. At MIT Blockchain consortium, or whoever they were, putting out, literally, educational seminars at college level! The stuff that you don\u2019t find on Bitcoin Twitter or anything anymore. It\u2019s buried now, it\u2019s too old or whatever! But I was just that kind of person, I had to know! So that did it for me \u2014 the idea that you didn\u2019t have to trust the protocol, but you could trust it once you understood it\u2014was fascinating to me! And then extrapolate that out into how money worked, and why it\u2019s so broken, and why we can\u2019t trust politicians anymore, and all this other stuff that\u2019s so related to good money working properly. That was it! I was down the rabbit hole and no way I\u2019m ever going out again! [44:28] I mean, it\u2019s too deep! There\u2019s so much to learn. There\u2019s so much about this, it\u2019s just so fascinating.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah I agree! That\u2019s true. So you gain this conviction and you\u2019ve got trust now in this system, or you\u2019re learning that you shouldn\u2019t trust things\u2014you verify it yourself. And I get going to conferences and talking to other Bitcoiners, but you\u2019re an individual thinker. You\u2019re a free thinker. You\u2019re your own person. What\u2019s driving you to print up double-sided business cards and hand them out with information on where you can go learn about Bitcoin? Why aren\u2019t you just buying your $20 and getting your fair share and moving on with your life?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim [45:17]: Alright, well. We all have a reason to want to live, right? I think if you have no reason to live then you might as well stop. There\u2019s a couple of things in there. I gotta lot of life behind me, so I think I\u2019ve got some wisdom that I think some people might benefit from. So I learned a long time ago that we go some stages in our lives, where we first \u2014 there\u2019s Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs\u2014you\u2019ve gotta get survival first. Stephan Covey in his book The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People puts it this way: We first must live, then we love, then we learn, then we want to leave a legacy. So there\u2019s four L\u2019s. So in living, we just gotta survive, and you don\u2019t really care about anything else if you\u2019re struggling for survival. But once you get that, you tend to want to have relationships for love. It\u2019s what help bring a little bit of fun to life. So you got survival, you got some relationships. And then, it turns out, most people want to grow! They\u2019re curious! And so they end up wanting to learn. [46:22] So I\u2019ve been down those roads, I\u2019ve done all that. I have my survival, I\u2019m doing okay. I\u2019ve got lots of great relationships all of my life. I\u2019ve been learning forever. But then it comes to \u2014 what does all this matter? What does it mean? Am I going to leave any kind of legacy on this planet whatsoever? There\u2019s billions of people that have come and gone and none of us know who they were. None of us. There\u2019s only a handful of people that have any kind of legacy on this planet. I don\u2019t expect to have one. I\u2019m too small of a fish in a giant pond! But, I can still have an effect on people individually. And that could have a ripple effect. The exponential effect: if I affect two people and they affect two people. So my efforts could actually help millions of people down the road that will never know that I had an effect on their future or will never know me, but if I stick to first principles, honesty and integrity, and truth, then I feel like any effort I put in that direction is not wasted. That I feel like my life was not wasted. And even if I am not known the world over as somebody important on this planet, I know that I\u2019ve done the best that I could with what was given to me. I didn\u2019t squander it. I tried to live an upstanding, honorable life, and then pass that forward! Pay it forward to somebody else that could use either my experience or simply my knowledge. People don\u2019t know about this money. [47:45] I\u2019m gonna back this up and say, if I was to give an elevator pitch to somebody and I had no idea where they were coming from, I would say, Money is the most important invention humans have ever come up with. It allows the division of labor, it allows us to get away from bartering, it allows us to trade, and it increases the value on the planet. Bitcoin is the best iteration of money that humans have ever come up with. Because it\u2019s got all the best properties of money, plus some additional ones that previous forms of money did not have. If Bitcoin is the best form of money, and money is the best invention humans have ever come up with, Bitcoin, by default, is the most important and best invention humans have ever come up with. Now, if you don\u2019t want to go shout that to the world, I don\u2019t know what to say! It\u2019s like Michael Saylor saying, Is this a non-correlated asset or is this fire that will change humanity, right? Bitcoin is gonna change humanity. It\u2019s not just a non-correlated asset. It\u2019s not just an investment. This is the best form of money, which allows pure economic calculation for every human on the planet! Free and fair trade for everybody! Productivity and prosperity for everybody on the planet, because this invention is now here! This is the most important thing ever created, ever. And we are living in one of the most important and influential times in all of human history, where we are watching humanity adopt a free market money that cannot get corrupted by governments. Gold was the best thing we had, but it got corrupted. This Bitcoin thing, I don\u2019t see anybody explaining how it\u2019s gonna get corrupted. It\u2019s set up in such a way that it can\u2019t be. The game theory is so perfect \u2014 at least so far \u2014 that it\u2019s fascinating. So as far as I\u2019m concerned, I can\u2019t not talk about this. Future generations need people like us to not give up. We will be talked about a hundred or a thousand years from now, like, Man, those people were strong believers! Had they not done this for us, we wouldn\u2019t be here today. We need to thank our ancestors. It\u2019s that kind of thing, that I believe we\u2019re all living in. We have to stand up against the craziness that\u2019s out there. We have to push it in everyone\u2019s faces that you\u2019re missing out! This is not only good for you, this is good for all of humanity. This is not a selfish thing on my part \u2014 sure, if more people adopt it, will the number go up? Will my Bitcoin be worth more? Of course it will! But if you don\u2019t adopt it, somebody else will. There\u2019s enough people on this planet. We don\u2019t need everybody to adopt it for this thing to be worth value, and for the rest of the world to be forced into adopting it. So everybody that I could talk to could ignore me, and Number will still go Up, because millions of people get convinced by someone else other than me. It really doesn\u2019t matter if my efforts are wasted. They\u2019re in the right place, and hopefully, it ripples out into the energy of the world in a positive way, affects lots of people, and humanity is better off in the long run. That\u2019s all I really want to see, is a happy, peaceful world, where everybody leaves everybody alone, and if you wanna go surfing you can go surfing, if you wanna read a book on a mountaintop you can go do that, that some government is not gonna come along and say, Sorry you\u2019re out of bounds! Oh, you out there in the ocean? Come in, you need to wear a mask! I mean, did you see the videos back in the early part of the year? Guy out on a paddle-board by himself in the ocean and the cops were calling him in, because he\u2019s supposed to be in his house or something. Give me a break! Oh, man. This is important stuff! We gotta get the word out. I don\u2019t care if I make a dime off this directly because of my words. Literally. You know, there\u2019s another thing: people often talk about, when left up to the market, you have this thing called the tragedy of the commons, where people won\u2019t take care of the things that they don\u2019t want to own. That\u2019s not true at all. I don\u2019t own Bitcoin, and I\u2019m taking care of it like it\u2019s my most precious little baby, right? And everybody in this space feels exactly like me! And I got out of my way, for free, to talk to you or anybody else that will listen, because \u2014 I\u2019m not trying to get paid directly for my efforts here. These efforts are important not just for me, but for a lot of people beyond me. When the politicians talk about, We\u2019re all in this together! Yeah, we are when it comes to something like money, that helps us all, that takes the power away from some parasite humans. Yeah, we\u2019re all in this together. In that regard, I feel very connected to everyone of the other humans on this planet. We\u2019re definitely all in this together. But as far as the way that they want things to go, No, we\u2019re not all in this together \u2014 because they just say how it goes and we\u2019re supposed to just listen. So, this is super important stuff and I\u2019m super passionate as you can hear. And I\u2019ll never stop talking about Bitcoin, and I\u2019ll never stop trying to convince people that they should get as much of it as possible. And hopefully that article I wrote convinces a few people, we\u2019ll see! I appreciate you promoting it, I see you re-tweeting it and stuff so that\u2019s very nice of you! And the more people the better, we just gotta get the word out! You know, that article will never change \u2014 other than the price of Bitcoin, the fundamentals in that article will never change, and I\u2019m glad I wrote it because somebody many years from now can read it and they can still get the point. There\u2019s nothing about that that\u2019s ever going to not be the same. Well, you could change the numbers in terms of the amount of people. The Bitcoin will never change, the amount of land will never change, so just change the numbers around, but the principles will never change. Get yourself some of this limited stuff, because it\u2019s probably gonna be good for you.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [52:59]: I love hearing from every Bitcoiner! I think every Bitcoiner has something to add, and a different perspective that is incrementally adding to the canon. And I did love the article, and I revisit it a lot, because it\u2019s building on the conversation that Trace was having that got in my head about real estate. If we were to look at the world from first principles, and align with first principles, and we\u2019re looking at: engineering, accounting, math, integrity, honesty, trust and trustworthiness, music, food, peace, contentment, sex, self-actualization, rational self-interest, kindness, and most importantly peace and love, how should Bitcoin be viewed as part of the universal energy of our existence? [53:45]"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: Okay, I had a feeling that you would ask me something around this. So, I had to give this a lot of thought. Anybody who\u2019s taken a basic statistics course will be able to understand what a bell curve is, and that we can look around at things and we can get generalizations about a lot of things, but never necessarily 100%, that\u2019s why in the middle of the bell curve, that\u2019s where the averages are gonna be, that at the tail ends that\u2019s where the outliers are gonna be. But there\u2019s something about physics and engineering that\u2019s definite. So let\u2019s just take gravity for example. We can measure gravity in different ways, but it never stops. It\u2019s always acting upon us, and we\u2019re stuck with it. We have to figure out to the best of our knowledge what it\u2019s doing to us and how can we use it or overcome it. So there are principles about the way waves move \u2014 sound waves, water waves. There are principles that govern the vibration of molecules, at least to the extent that humans have been able to visualize or observe these things and measure these things. So on a molecular level, we can almost anticipate \u2014 it\u2019s like action, reaction. If this happens, we can anticipate that will happen. So if we heat up some water, eventually when that water temperature gets to 212 degrees it\u2019s gonna start boiling. It happens every single time\u2014we can count on it, right? That\u2019s because, in physics, the molecules, they act a certain way and they always act that way when given the same parameters. So in this case you add heat, you add enough heat, the molecules speed up, it turns into a boil. Nothing\u2019s ever gonna change that! All we can do is work with it. So these first principles that are all over the place are there, they\u2019re acting on us. Another interesting thing I noticed when I was watching a slow-motion video had to do with music notes. And I found it interesting that when you take a note, any note, and you photograph a guitar string and you watch the vibration of that note, and you go up one octave or go down one octave, the speed at which the string vibrates is exactly double or exactly half. Literally exactly! And there\u2019s a principle going on there! It\u2019s the way energy flows. And so, there\u2019s a lot of principles that are acting all around us, all the time. When we align ourselves with those principles, things work out. When we don\u2019t align with them, they don\u2019t work out. Let me take it to an example with surfing: so when I\u2019m trying to go surfing, I gotta deal with a whole bunch of physics that I have nothing to do with. Wind makes waves, those waves come towards the beach, the bottom contour forces the waves to rise up, they peel in a certain given direction\u2014but every wave is a little bit different \u2014 and the wind, the tide, they all can affect it. But in general, I\u2019m gonna want to paddle towards the beach, I\u2019m gonna want to get up to the same speed as the wave, I\u2019m gonna want to stand up and, using the physics of my board, lean on the board in such a way that it makes turns in the direction I want it to go, and then I get to ride the energy of this wave that\u2019s moving towards the beach whether I\u2019m there or not. So the physics involved with all of that, when you go back to the bell curve, there\u2019s a billion, gadrillion, gazillion variations on that single wave, me riding it, and my position on that wave. [57:35] If I was six inches over when I started my paddling, my wave would\u2019ve been different. When I stood up, if my feet were one centimeter a little [more] forward than they were, my ride would\u2019ve been different. So, the principles underlying what combination is gonna give you what outcome \u2014 they\u2019re there, they\u2019re set in stone by the universe. It\u2019s what combination of those principles that we put together that gives us our outcome. So, you go surfing at the very same surf spot where the wave peels in the same direction every time, and still, every wave is different, every time you stand up you gotta find the right spot on your board, and then, you have to look at that wave as it\u2019s rising up in front of you and constantly make adjustments to get your ride and go down the line and get that enjoyment out of that. And all of that is based on physics that you don\u2019t get to control, other than your own motion! It\u2019s like, you have to blend you with the energy around you. We are doing this over time. When we listen to music that we like, we are blending our brainwaves with harmonic resonance of sound that is pleasing to us, it comes through! When two notes are dissonant from each other, our brains don\u2019t like it. There\u2019s an interesting phenomenon in photography, that generally, people like pictures that are divided up like a tic-tac-toe board, it\u2019s the rule of thirds. So you can look at many, many photographs that are cut up into thirds, both horizontally and vertically, and something about our human nature likes that. We tend to gravitate towards things that conform with a certain energy that we as humans find pleasing. I think it translates into food, although I\u2019m far from any kind of food connoisseur. But there are certain foods that, when combined together, enhance both of the things put together, and other combinations that completely destroy each individual ingredient. And there\u2019s something about a harmonic resonance of the molecules on our taste buds, that we love this combination, we hate that. And that\u2019s generally true! Will some people like music that\u2019s out of tune? Yeah! They\u2019re at the very tail end of the bell curve. Whereas, everybody else is generally in the middle \u2014 when the music\u2019s in tune, and it follows the scale, and the notes come together right. You end up in the middle of the bell curve where almost everybody seems to think it\u2019s good. It sounds generally pleasing. [59:56] The same with things we see, and so there\u2019s a scale \u2014 on the bell curve \u2014 from one end to the other, going through the middle, where you find the bulk of everybody. So those are the things where we are interacting with the world around us. There\u2019s this phrase\u2014I wish I could think of it \u2014 that describes the grey areas between every variation of any system. But the principles of nature are underlying all of this, and they never change. These are the first principles. So when you said it, you made a list of things, because I wrote them down. So something like truth, is a principle. Now it\u2019s not a physics principle, it\u2019s not an engineering principle like building a building where the structure\u2019s gonna collapse if you use the wrong materials, but truth is one of these things that\u2019s an underlying principle. When you have truth, you have the ability to trust. What we find when we\u2019re trusting something, we are trusting the overlapping of character and competence. So we\u2019re trusting somebody\u2019s character \u2014 are they truthful in how they are. Do they seem honest? But what we\u2019re also trusting is someone\u2019s competence \u2014 do they know what they\u2019re talking about? And so, when you\u2019re trying to find truth, you\u2019re trying to also extrapolate trust and trustworthiness in order to find that truth, so you gotta dig down into these things in order to know if truth is actually there. But truth is there somewhere! It\u2019s a matter of trying to uncover it. One of the things we say in Bitcoin is that Bitcoin is just a big truth machine. Because it keeps track of a limited number of digital files perfectly! And we can absolutely count on the truthfulness of the Bitcoin blockchain, because we know how it works, we know how the transactions are propagated, we know how the blocks are made, and it\u2019s all based on math that all can be corroborated. And so there\u2019s this truth that is basic, absolute truth! It\u2019s like a force of nature! It\u2019s built in such a way that it resonates harmonically with the energy around everything. And you can trust it! [1:02:20] Once you recognize the truth that it bears. And you can learn to trust it and use it. And it\u2019s like any other trust that we can find: in engineering, you can test materials, setting up examples, and breaking things to the point that you know how much energy it takes to break something. And then you can engineer a building to not fail, because the loads will never get to the level of what you calculated it would need [for] it to break, and then you put a 100% safety factor just to be careful. So now you\u2019re using truths in engineering to give you something that may or may not work. So for example, let me extrapolate out further: you are looking at a bell curve\u2014engineer calculates a whole bunch of things he knows are absolutely going to always happen, and you go out and you get a set of plans and you start building the building, right? And unbeknownst to you that a whole bunch of people along the way cut a little bit of corners thinking it wasn\u2019t gonna matter. And then in the end, the collective cutting of corners causes something to fail. And no one saw it coming because the engineer designed the building to be perfect and it all should\u2019ve worked! Except that somebody took their own belief or their own opinion, without checking with truth. And they said, Nah, we don\u2019t need this! Because they just believed it! They just thought, for whatever reason, they didn\u2019t check with actual truth. So there\u2019s a lot of this that\u2019s tied together around us in the world, I think. Things like music, things like taste, things that are visual, things that are social like truth or trustworthiness. These things have certain fundamental principles that are unchangeable and it\u2019s us that changes around them. It\u2019s us that try to find harmony with them. And it\u2019s when we find the best harmony with all these different universal first principles that are around us anyway, that we find, not only our own happiness, but we find a way to live in this world and deal with truth and those kinds of important concepts. [1:04:18] I guess that\u2019s the best way to think about it. I\u2019ve said this many times, that the principles don\u2019t care about your knowledge of them, or your attitude towards them. They act anyway. You don\u2019t have to know about them, and if you know about them, you can have a crappy attitude about them, and they don\u2019t give a crap! Principles will act on you! Gravity\u2019s gonna act on you! Engineering forces are gonna act on you! Truth is gonna act on you, whether you like it or not! You wanna lie all day long? Truth is gonna come back to bite you in the ass one day! It\u2019s just how it works! These things are\u2014I don\u2019t know \u2014they\u2019re just the basis of everything that works on this planet. The closer you get to fundamental truths in all these different areas, the easier it\u2019s gonna be to not only navigate this crazy world, but get enjoyment out of this crazy world. And when I found Bitcoin and I started connecting these dots in my own head, about all the things that I\u2019ve had to uncover myself about how things actually work, it just became so strong for me, in terms of why it matters and why I care so much about it \u2014 getting back to why I give a crap to talk about this all day long. This is so important! [1:05:27] I just wanted to back up a second: when I was a kid I took everything apart. I just wanted to know how everything worked. One of the best presents I ever got was a toolbox full of tools when I was like 8 years old. And I could work on my bicycle! And you know, if you try to fix the brakes on your bicycle and you mess that up and you need them and they don\u2019t work, you\u2019re gonna figure out real quick that principles actually matter. Tightening the nut just the right amount is gonna matter! Lining up the pad to the tire just right so touches when you squeeze the brake is gonna matter! Making sure there\u2019s no rust inside the cable housing so that the cable slides smoothly inside \u2014 these are all physics principles. They absolutely matter to the functioning of your bicycle brake! And if one of those things isn\u2019t working right, you may find yourself in position where you\u2019re gonna crash because the brake you thought was gonna work is not working, because some of the principles are broken. So when you\u2019re living in a world where you don\u2019t get a chance to argue this stuff \u2014 you have to align yourself with it? That\u2019s the world I grew up with, literally everything around me had to fit in to this \u2014if I can\u2019t see the logic I\u2019m not going with that! And so, it\u2019s why I\u2019ve resisted stupid government edicts all the time, and stupid rules that are everywhere on the planet. I just can\u2019t relate, they make no sense! You know, victimless crimes that are everywhere! This is just other human beings writing words on paper, deciding that they want other human beings they don\u2019t even know to act in certain ways, and if they don\u2019t, they\u2019re gonna take violence upon them, steal their money, just because they don\u2019t like something about them? I just can\u2019t stand any of that! [There\u2019s] no logic in it, it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not right! I just push back against all that! [1:07:01] Bitcoin was just the thing that tied it all together for me, literally. Once I realized why money\u2019s important, how it works, how everything stems from money\u2014literally everything stems from money \u2014 that we get to value [things] in society and it all comes because of the use of money. Once I saw that and once I saw how important Bitcoin was, it allowed all these other things I\u2019ve known intuitively to become connected. It\u2019s allowed me to be able to have this conversation with you. To know and feel deep down \u2014 I\u2019ve studied some of it as well \u2014 to know that these things are real. They\u2019re true! They\u2019re there, and we don\u2019t get to choose about them, we just get to act with them! I wish I could remember the quote exactly, one of my favorite books is the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, because it\u2019s based on principles. And in the book he tells a story of a ship captain calling out on the radio, You\u2019re in our lane! You must move out of our lane! There\u2019s a big light out in front of them and they\u2019re worried they\u2019re gonna crash into another ship. And so the radio comes back, No! You get out of our lane! And the captain says, You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking to! I\u2019m Captain So and So of Such and Such Big Important ship, and you need to move right now or we\u2019re going to hit you! And the voices comes over the loudspeaker, I don\u2019t care who you are! This is the lighthouse! You better move or you\u2019re gonna crash! Right? So principles don\u2019t give a crap! [1:08:22] They act on us whether we know about them, or whatever the attitude of them is. So principles are like lighthouses \u2014 we need to bend ourselves to them! They do not get out of our way!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Gravity\u2019s gonna gravity, Bitcoin\u2019s gonna Bitcoin, the ocean\u2019s gonna ocean! What\u2019s been more impactful on your life, Bitcoin or surfing?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: Ooh! Surfing! You know, surfing, because it\u2019s given me an identity and it\u2019s allowed me to travel around the world and \u2014 just the experience of going surfing is absolutely amazing! I don\u2019t know how else to describe it other than to be literally in unison with nature for several seconds at a time when you\u2019re riding a wave. The unison you feel \u2014 the idea that the ocean is doing what it\u2019s gonna do and you\u2019re trying to sink up with it \u2014 it\u2019s not only really, really hard, but it\u2019s really fulfilling when you get to do it, and when you get good at it! So it\u2019s given me kind of a purpose in life. Bitcoin\u2019s been huge, obviously, but I think Bitcoin just, like, enhances my surfing now. It just makes my surfing even better I guess! It\u2019s given me so much! The other thing, I\u2019m just gonna divert here for a quick second, but, learning about truth, and learning about Bitcoin, I was very fortunate to get invited to a steak dinner with Saifedean and Pierre Rochard in New York City, where I was already in the process of trying to improve my health, and then I got completely red-pilled by Saifedean about, You can only eat steak! And like, Meat is the most important food! You shouldn\u2019t eat anything else! I\u2019m like, Woah! This guy\u2019s a little extreme, but okay! He wrote a really good book, so, maybe I should consider what he\u2019s talking about! But as I said I was already on a quest to get healthy here, and I learned that a lot of the food I used to eat was really bad for me. And it worked! I switched around, I eat mostly meat at this point, and my health has dramatically improved, and it\u2019s improved my surfing! So all these things are so tied together! When you find truth in one thing, all of a sudden you stumble along on some truths somewhere else. I have to say, my enthusiasm for my surfing has increased because my health has increased because I\u2019ve found a little more truth in dietary information because I\u2019ve found a little more truth in Bitcoin! [1:10:40] It\u2019s amazing how it ripples through your life. Surfing is definitely a little more important but, boy, Bitcoin has had a huge impact. It\u2019s been almost 4 years it\u2019s been in my life, so. Ooh, it\u2019s getting close! Maybe in another 20 years I might have to say Bitcoin has been more impactful!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Fair enough! What\u2019s your favorite surfing movie?"}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: Oh wow, shoot! That\u2019s a tough one, there\u2019s so many and they\u2019re all unique. I have to say Endless Summer 2 was really good, because it built on the first Endless Summer, but it used a little more modern take. But then there\u2019s another one called Riding Giants which, when I saw it was unbelievable. Because riding super big waves is really amazing. I\u2019ve been out in some very big surf, but I would never try to tackle some of the waves that some of these guys ride, so that was impressive. I saw it in a movie theater on a big screen so that was really awesome. I might\u2019ve even seen that in an IMAX theater, so that was pretty good. But there\u2019s a lot of little cult ones. I went to a place in Mexico many times, over and over again, because it\u2019s such a great surf spot. It\u2019s called Puerto Escondido. And when I went there \u2014 it was probably in the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s when I was going there a lot \u2014 there was a guy that planted himself there all season and he would shoot videos. And he put out a couple, they\u2019re called Puerto Underground by a guy named Dave Ogle. And some of the footage he\u2019s got is absolutely phenomenal! I was fortunate enough that he filmed me on enough of my waves, while he was out there making his surf videos, and he made me my own personal surf video that I got on VHS tape, I gotta make it digital one day. But I got me surfing this one spot and he put music to it, it\u2019s my own little professional video. But he made some really insane videos of this place, Puerto Escondido. I\u2019d have to say they\u2019re up high on my list of good videos.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah. This has been awesome! I\u2019ll definitely give you the floor with the last words. Hanging ten with Surfer Jim has been dope! I really enjoyed this. Definitely let everyone know where they could find you, and if you have any parting words, the floor is yours."}
{"prompt": "Surfer Jim: Well, thank you! I really appreciate you giving me the opportunity. I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think about this when you first offered this to me. And so I did get out a lot of what I wanted to say already and I really appreciate not only the opportunity, but the questions you asked me and the way you posed them allowed me to run with it, so to speak. If anybody does want to find me they can find me on Twitter @surferjimw. That\u2019s pretty much it. I\u2019d never done social media until I started learning about Bitcoin. I was told, Well, if you wanna learn about Bitcoin you better follow some people on Twitter! And I hit myself on the forehead and said, Ah! I gotta learn Twitter? What is that crap! Social media? I don\u2019t want to do that! I never did Facebook. But I did it! Twitter was worth it! Twitter is a very fascinating platform, there\u2019s a lot of smart people on there, and I spew out enough stuff, some of it might be worthwhile, so if you want to hear what I have to say, I\u2019m on Twitter. My last shill is gonna have to be for the Long Island Surf Bar. So a good friend of mine, he went down to Typhoon Lagoon in Disneyworld in Florida, where you can rent the wave pool and go surfing in it. He did that, and then he was just so enamored by the whole thing, he came back and said to me, Jim, we gotta build a surf bar on Long Island! And I said, Well, Chris, good luck! I can\u2019t build a surf bar! I mean, I\u2019ll help you if you want to try and build one. And he wanted to! And so we\u2019ve been spending about the last five or six years \u2014 he, myself, and his son, trying to figure out if we could build a surf bar. And him and his son \u2014 I give his son a ton of credit, he was just a teenager when we started the process, but he has taken the bull by the horns and he has run with it. This kid knows anything and everything about this project, and over the past five years we built the website, we built the mailing list, we did a lot of market research. And we\u2019re gonna build the first wave pool on Long Island! We have cutting edge technology that enhances all of the technology that\u2019s out there. We have some proprietary stuff. I built a test tank. I was asked to build, based on the specifications given to me by the pool designer. So we run little mini waves in our little test tank. Chris went out and bought land \u2014 we got three acres of land to build this wave pool on. We have site-plan approval from the town of Brookhaven, where it\u2019s going to be located. So they\u2019ve already given us permission to build the surf bar. And we are now in the process of getting the permits to build the park, so they say, You can build it but now you\u2019ve gotta show us how you\u2019re gonna build it. So we\u2019ve gotta meet water filtration standards and all the crazy safety standards for a public pool, but we are gonna build a state of the art wave pool on the land, the tag-line is, Always 7 ft. and hollow. So we want a wave that you can stand up inside the tube, every single wave, over and over if you want. And we believe we can make that because the tests in our tank show us that we\u2019re meeting all our benchmarks that we need to meet. So we\u2019re hoping by about a year from now this thing\u2019s gonna be open. Oh! And let me tell you another thing: we\u2019re gonna make our own electricity. This ties into Bitcoin so this is a good ending for this whole podcast. We are gonna make our own electricity. We ran the numbers on what is it gonna take to make this thing possible. We figured out, if we bring natural gas into the site and run our own natural gas generators, we can make all our own electricity! We also figured out that all this equipment that\u2019s gonna make the waves and generate the electricity is all gonna produce heat, so we\u2019re gonna take the heat and we\u2019re gonna stick it in the water, and we\u2019re gonna have warm water year-round. This is gonna be an outdoor pool but in the winter it will still be warm. And then I got to thinking, after listening to Marty Bent talk about Great American Mining and what they\u2019re doing with flared natural gas in the oil fields, I thought to myself, You know, the generators are gonna run constantly, but the load on the generators is gonna go up and down constantly. And I see no reason why we can\u2019t turn on and off Bitcoin miners and take advantage of the excess electricity that would just get dumped back into the grid or sent back into the ground if it isn\u2019t used. So I pretty much have the guys convinced, my partners here, that we might be setting up some Bitcoin miners and we\u2019ll be making sats and waves on the Long Island Wave Pool. First of its kind! I would like to see that play out, but even if it doesn\u2019t, we\u2019ll make a really great wave pool and I may spend the next 10 years building ten more of them with my friend\u2019s son, who has a plan to build ten in the next 10 years. So I\u2019ve got that going for me along with Bitcoin, so I\u2019m about as stoked and optimistic as anybody could be in this space, that\u2019s for sure! That\u2019s my story!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah! This has been totally tubular and gnarly talking Bitcoin waves with Surfer Jim! This has been so dope!"}

{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Well thank you. I think of myself as the greeter \u2014 the Bitcoin greeter that meets you when you come in, I\u2019m like, Hello, folks! Welcome to Bitcoin! How can I help you find something today? The funny thing is that the journey you described, which is: overcoming all of these risks and objections, it\u2019s not something that only newbies go through. I think it\u2019s something everyone in Bitcoin goes through. So there\u2019s no such thing as someone who came into Bitcoin fully convinced, and wasn\u2019t a skeptic. And that shouldn\u2019t be the case. We should all be skeptics, right? At first. Because, what we\u2019re talking about is something that defies many of our expectations and beliefs \u2014 even Satoshi Nakamoto was a skeptic! They didn\u2019t come in and say, This is going to work! They came in and said, Well, this might work, and if it did work, here\u2019s how it might play out. [06:46] And they didn\u2019t make all of those predictions correctly. Every single person after that came in with, I have a lot of questions about how this could go wrong! And the process of becoming persuaded about the robustness of this system comes from two-parts experience: the (1) first one is, as you\u2019re thinking and understanding more and more of this system, these little fears pop up, these little risks, and you\u2019re like, Huh, I wonder if, if this happened, could that be the Achilles heel? What\u2019s the catch here? And you come up with these risks. And so gradually overcoming those and understanding, Oh, well, no, that wouldn\u2019t actually work. Bitcoin would survive that. So one perspective is analytical\u2014theoretical: I don\u2019t think that would work because here\u2019s why the technology would adapt. The second part\u2014which is even more interesting \u2014 that I\u2019ve experienced, is: actually seeing these things play out. Like, what happens if the one and only exchange loses everything two years in? That actually happened! And, I was like, We probably won\u2019t survive this. And then we did. And that taught me something about the robustness. So I think that\u2019s a great basis for us to help people go on that skeptic journey, because it\u2019s a healthy perspective to have. Talk about some of the theoretical attacks but also talk about some of the experiences we\u2019ve had that have persuaded us that this isn\u2019t just theory. That, in practice, we\u2019ve seen some some of these things play out.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [08:27]: Yeah. Okay, well since you brought that one up, maybe for some historical context, how did you feel when there\u2019s this one exchange that was pretty much the only place where, I mean \u2014 some people say that it was about 70% of the whole Bitcoin supply was being traded on Mt. Gox \u2014 and then it turned out that the whole thing is just shut down, withdrawals, and it\u2019s all over. Can you remember where you were and how you felt when that actually happened?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Oh absolutely I can. So, first of all, my skepticism of Mt. Gox\u2014which was a website that was originally bought as a Magic: The Gathering online exchange, and then converted and pivoted to being a Bitcoin exchange, and was the only Bitcoin exchange. My journey of skepticism began long before Mt. Gox failed. Mt. Gox had had a lot of growing pains, and every time the volume would go up, the lag of trading would shoot through the roof, which would cause a lot of people a lot of tears, right? If you put in an order at a specific price, and then it takes 20 minutes to fill that order, but in the meantime the price has dropped significantly, and you end up losing money\u2014that hurts. So I remember that I had been railing against this site and saying, Listen, this isn\u2019t safe! Do not store your money here! This was the beginning of me beginning to say things like, Not your keys, not your coins. I had started saying that back then, and telling people why they shouldn\u2019t leave money on an exchange. But, even though I was saying that, there\u2019s two aspects: there\u2019s a lot of people who had money on the exchange who were basically treating it as a vault, as a wallet, not an exchange. But there were also all of the exchange functions. If you wanted to convert USD or any other currency into Bitcoin or back, that was pretty much the only service. This was before any others existed. I remember getting the call \u2014 this was before it became public \u2014 I got the call from some people who were running one of the biggest wallets in the space, who I was working with at the time. And I was in a diner meeting with some family friends for brunch in San Francisco. And I got the call, and I said, Excuse me one second, I gotta take this call\u2014it seems urgent. I took the call and they said, Um, we just heard\u2014it\u2019s probably going to go public in the next hour or so \u2014 Mt. Gox is bankrupt. The money\u2019s all gone. And it\u2019s gonna shut down. And I remember feeling, like, Oof. That\u2019s it \u2014 we\u2019re done! You know, by that point, I\u2019d put a year and a half of my life into this, all of my savings, I\u2019m in debt, I don\u2019t have a job, I haven\u2019t yet been paid to do anything in the Bitcoin space. And it was the first time that I actually felt, Oh! Fuu\u2014 this could be it. [11:54] And really, because I\u2019d seen that happen before with Liberty Dollar, and E-Gold, and bunch of other, more centralized digital currencies before that. So it was this sinking feeling, and I cried that day. I was very upset, I was like, I\u2019ve basically lost everything. I had no money on Mt. Gox, but I felt \u2014 this will kill Bitcoin. This could kill Bitcoin. And it didn\u2019t. And that really, really changed my perspective on how robust this system is.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [12:42]: Yeah. I do remember what a time it was. Prior to this, it\u2019s easy for people to come along now, and I guess a lot of people think they\u2019ve missed the boat. But, you know, Bitcoin shouldn\u2019t have succeeded. It was very, very unlikely to succeed. And every objection that people had back then were really real objections that were very hard to counter at the time. But yeah, everybody losing their money certainly felt like, Okay, this is the end."}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Yes. Obviously a lot of people who used the exchange as a wallet lost their money. I think it was, at the time, something like three-quarters of a billion dollars. At a time when that was a very significant percentage of the total Bitcoin out there. One of the interesting things is, What can we extrapolate from that? Today a lot of people will say \u2014 and I hear this criticism all the time \u2014 that, if governments wanted to end Bitcoin, all they have to do is shut down the on-ramps and off-ramps. Make it very difficult to exchange, and that would kill Bitcoin. And part of my prior experience helps me with this, because I remember back with what happened with Mt. Gox: for a period of time, not only did we not have any exchanges, but we also lost a significant amount of Bitcoin that ended up being stolen. And it didn\u2019t kill Bitcoin then \u2014 when a single exchange was enough to effectively shut down all official channels for converting fiat to Bitcoin. And leaving only peer to peer mechanisms \u2014 exchanging cash, among others. Now, not only would you have to do that in a massive, global coordinated effort by world governments \u2014 because if you leave any of those doors open, everything just flows through there \u2014 now we also have stablecoins which allow us to deal with the other aspect which was problematic then, which is wire transfers of dollars. So we can flow enormous volume through these exchanges. And, even then it wouldn\u2019t work. People would revert to P2P. Yeah, it would stop the institutional investors, it would slow down our progress, it would hurt the price temporarily. But, if you realize, at that moment, that this won\u2019t actually kill it, you get two results: the first one is, any price decline you see, if you know it\u2019s not gonna kill, you start thinking, Well, I mean, this might be an opportunity. We might be seeing something that is temporary, but doesn\u2019t change the long term valuation. In which case, you act on that. But the other thing is, you realize that, that result and that mentality changes the calculation upfront, which is: in order for this to work you\u2019d have to have concerted, massive coordination between world governments. But, if they knew that, in the end, there was a significant possibility that this wouldn\u2019t actually kill Bitcoin, and if they knew that trying but failing to kill it, ends up backfiring \u2014 because it feeds the narrative of This thing can survive even concerted action by national governments at a massive scale \u2014 well then they don\u2019t even try, because that\u2019s too dangerous to try. As they say, If you\u2019re gonna take a shot at the King, make sure you don\u2019t miss. [16:47] And this is exactly the case: every attempt to kill Bitcoin that fails, ends up inadvertently strengthening the narrative that it is not possible to kill this thing. So therefore, there\u2019s this strategic game that gets play at a meta-level, which is: it\u2019s actually better not to try direct attacks like that, because if they fail, they\u2019re worse than not trying at all.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon: Well I remember, I was in Shanghai on a boat at a Bitcoin conference with lots of people from the Bitcoin community in this one boat, and the announcement came through that some of the CEOs of the exchanges in China were arrested, and they announced that there was a ban on Bitcoin exchanges in China. And suddenly, we were on this boat with lots of people that were at the conference, and we heard these sirens happening, and we thought that everyone was coming, that this boat was gonna be pulled aside and we were all going to disappear in a prison in China. But then the boat just went straight past and everything carried. But the price corrected, and it had a couple of thousand points that came off the price at that stage. But then that went into a raging bull market and we had these industries\u2014and what I\u2019ve seen is that every time, firstly \u2014 you talked about it \u2014 it has to be coordinated, because when one country does it, we\u2019ve seen what happens. And the two trends that I saw as a result of that were (1) firstly, all of the volume went to Japan, South Korea, and Singapore. And Japan\u2014who were the host of the exchange we talked about earlier \u2014 Mt. Gox, and another big one that got hacked, Coincheck, had been working a lot on their regulations of crypto-exchanges. And so, China\u2014they allowed the mining industry to continue, but they banned the exchanges. Now the interesting thing about that is, if I were a government, and I was trying to collect lots of data, mining is: you put some fiat money in, you buy some machines and Bitcoins come out and they can go anywhere. But with exchanges, you gotta do all the Know Your Customer and you\u2019ve gotta collect all the data. So what happened is that all of the data went to South Korean exchanges, Japanese exchanges, and Singapore exchanges. And China lost the data collection that they might have wanted. As we know, it\u2019s a big agenda of governments to collect all of that data. The (2) second thing that happened\u2014so, it just goes to another country, so then you have to have the coordinated effort\u2014but the second thing is, you start to get the real innovation coming through, and that was when, it was after that, that this phrase \u201cDEX\u201d came around, decentralized exchange. Because, everyone starts figuring out, Well, how do you do this in the peer to peer? You know, everyone was doing this peer to peer, for example, if you had to go exchange cash, but then through technology, people started figuring out, How can we do that online? And the innovation just gets further and further and further. So if you start to see\u2014right now, the big thing is DeFi \u2014 if there is a regulatory crackdown, which I\u2019m sure there will be, then people start to push the innovation further, and then other countries see the opportunities and start putting robust regulations that are centralized. So, to me it drives the centralized business somewhere else, and the drives the decentralized innovation as a result, and it just continues."}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: It\u2019s free! It\u2019s free, because if you have one gate that\u2019s free, everybody goes through that gate! I mean there still might be some people who go through the other gates because they\u2019ve already paid for the ticket, maybe for convenience because it\u2019s closer to the parking lot, but just like when you have these outdoor concerts and someone knocks one of the fences down and then you see a whole group of band fans going, Waaagh!, running through the fences through the fields, being chased by one or two elderly security guards in yellow vests, completely failing to stop the crowd. This is the asymmetry of centralized versus decentralized: in order to control a system like that, that operates on a centralized basis, you have to 100% block all the exits. Otherwise, if you let one exit\u2014and the switching costs between gates are zero \u2014 the bottom line is that you\u2019ve failed. So a 1% failure in control, is entirely equivalent to a 100% failure in control. So, you\u2019ve got centralized systems and centralized governments that have to coordinate perfectly, with no one stepping out of the game. And then you have a decentralized system that is reacting to these decisions. And the decentralized system doesn\u2019t have to succeed everywhere, it only has to succeed in one place, because this is virtual \u2014 because there is no switching cost \u2014 you just redirect all of the flows through that one place. [23:41] And you may lose some volume at first, but very quickly you\u2019re then going to focus the innovation on optimizing that path, and there\u2019s a very big monetary reward for those who optimize it. It\u2019s a bit like trying to build a dam and you\u2019ve got the world\u2019s best engineers and I\u2019m one dude with a little drill. You know? Great dam you\u2019ve got there! But I\u2019ve got a hammer drill, so let\u2019s see who wins? I don\u2019t need to make the whole dam fall down. I only need to make a hole this big. That\u2019s it! The water will do the rest. The water will take that tiny hole, and it will optimize its egress by making it wider and wider and wider until the dam is gone. So, money works that way! If you have a hole this big in the international system of financial controls and surveillance, which is exactly what Bitcoin is \u2014 it\u2019s the pinprick \u2014 the small trickle that gets through actually funds the development and the innovation and the technology and the standing up of infrastructure to widen that hole. If you\u2019ve got a country like Venezuela that has currency controls, and where the premium for Bitcoin is 30% above price, then whoever is able to send a trickle of Bitcoin into Venezuela and exchange it earns a 30% premium to use to expand their operations as fast as they can! And so that just makes the hole bigger! And this keeps repeating at every level. [25:26] So, decentralized versus centralized systems: the centralizers have to get everything right, the decentralized system only has to make a pinprick. That pinprick will actually self-fund its widening and the innovation, and the end result will be that you just break through the dam completely. And this has happened again and again and again with Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [25:53]: Yeah. So, let\u2019s look at the coordinated effort scenario. I can imagine a world, especially where we are today, where IMF calls out for a Bretton Woods II\u2014 already done. They sit down in a meeting, and it turns out that the whole world has complete ruined their fiscal and monetary policy \u2014 done. And they have to all sit around in a room, and they all coordinate a Facebook-style Libra monetary system using central bank digital currencies, and they decide on a global scale that they\u2019re all gonna coordinate and implement some new global monetary system that\u2019s backed by a basket of all these different currencies. And then simultaneously they all agree that in order to opt in to this system, they all need to make Bitcoin illegal for use and purchase in their country. I think the only example we ever got of something like that was when the United States tried to make gold illegal so they could prevent hoarding, but we\u2019ve never seen it on a global, coordinated scale. So while that is one of the risks that could happen, do you think Bitcoin could survive such a coordinated, centralized monetary system and do it with a kind of [inaudible]?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos [27:24]: It would absolutely survive. It would stop thriving \u2014 temporarily. And the reason for that is because, right now, a lot of the volume in Bitcoin is driven by those who can use other monetary systems, have access to the global economy, and choose to, voluntarily, use Bitcoin as a hedge, as a speculative instrument, as a placing, as a way to invest some future protocol. I mean, a lot of those people would obviously be discouraged by such regulations. It all comes down to where you think the primary economic value of the world economy lies. Does it lie in the fiat-denominated spreadsheets of investors and speculators operating in the markets? Are the markets the economy? The regulated, equity global markets, the currency markets? Is that the world economy? Or is the world economy a million papaya and banana stands on the sides of the roads, or taco trucks? Is the world economy the productive output of 7.5 billion humans trying to improve their own lot? I certainly believe it\u2019s the latter. Which then means that, what exactly does that 7.5 billion mass of humanity have to lose, if the issue here is: I can either make a living, or follow the law. I either follow the law, and starve. Or break the law, and survive. Well, we know exactly how that equation works out, because we see it today in the global patterns of adoption of Bitcoin. In the adoption across the global south, where it is being used as a tool of survival. And for that population, if you had this global coordination, that would fail. So that\u2019s one aspect. But the other aspect is this: Great, so the IMF comes out and does this and they do this whole global coordination thing, and they try to shut down Bitcoin. Well, here\u2019s the thing: this is a bit like OPEC. This is a bit like cartel activity. And cartel activities work best when the market is very small, when the number of parties that have to coordinate is very small, and when the upside is very high. But what we\u2019re talking about here is coordinating between a hundred different governments around the world in a very international system on something like money that is broadly used. Now, to me that\u2019s impossible. Because, any country that breaks ranks with the cartel, gains enormously through arbitrage. By saying, You know, that\u2019s cute what you\u2019re trying to do, but we think that if we actually go our own way and we enable on-ramps and off-ramps into and out of Bitcoin, in the first round, we\u2019re going to get a lot of the people who are abandoning Bitcoin to come to us. And in the second round, we\u2019re going to actually be able to grow substantially by being outside the system, because we\u2019re outside the system already. China would do that, in my opinion. Almost immediately! They have no strategic advantage to signing on to a global system that is already dominated by the US and used for sanctions and geopolitical control, and hand them a new system that\u2019s that, minus any alternatives, competition, exits, or safety valves. That\u2019s strategic suicide. And of course for the very same reasons, Russia wouldn\u2019t sign on to this. And what you end up doing is you have exactly the kind of split that we saw during the Cold War. You end up with a currency Cold War. And then you have a situation where there are basically two spheres of influence: there\u2019s the First World \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t know if you know this but the term Third World simply meant the unaligned nations \u2014 First World was the Western countries on the Cold War, Second World was the Eastern countries that were involved in the Cold War, and Third World, was just anyone who wasn\u2019t with either the Soviets or the Americans. It was about splitting the world into two spheres of influence. So if you end up doing that with currencies again, where you have the post-Bretton Woods international money system dominated by Western nations, and then you have the outsiders saying No!, dominated by China and Russia, which would end up taking most of Africa with them, a good chunk of South America, all of Southeast Asia, you then end up with two completely different spheres of the economy. Now let\u2019s think about this: they would not be allowed to talk to each other, right? Because they\u2019re both closed systems. So there\u2019d be only one way to move value from one to the other, which would be a permissionless system. [33:16] In that case, Bitcoin actually becomes the rails for connecting the two spheres. So if you want to move money from the Sino-Soviet region of money to the Anglo region of money, the only rail that connects the two is Bitcoin. I mean, that, in my opinion, not only fails spectacularly but then it actually elevates Bitcoin to world reserve currency very very quickly \u2014 through neutrality. Neutrality becomes its leading factor. Both sides see that. If I have to choose between a system that\u2019s controlled by this set of countries that are not allied with me, or that set of countries that are not allied with me, how about I just choose a system that\u2019s not controlled by any country, so it doesn\u2019t matter if they are allied with me or not. Neutrality then becomes the winner, by default.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [34:16]: Yeah. So Bitcoin becomes a tool for geopolitical currency wars."}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Yes! And the thing is, if you create a system whereby the dominant function of currency is sanctions, then sanctions evasion is no longer a game of one or two countries. Then sanctions evasion is a game of half the planet against the other half of the planet, right? At which point, the sanctions-evading currency becomes geopolitically important.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon: Okay, let\u2019s move to another common objection. Let\u2019s look at mining. So firstly, let\u2019s not assume everyone knows what mining is. So, Bitcoin is backed by proof of work, and we\u2019re about to get a large-scale experiment of one of the significant cryptocurrencies \u2014 Ethereum \u2014 switching from proof of work to proof of stake, so we actually get to see two cryptocurrencies that have adoption for their own use-cases, and we get to actually see in real time the infinite expectations of what happens with proof of work and proof of stake, assuming these two systems survive. But one of the big objections is the whole inefficiency of proof of work, and how bad it is for the environment, and how, if Bitcoin becomes as significant as it could be, it will consume so much electricity that it becomes this just completely clunky, inefficient network. What would you say about the proof of work and\u2014actually maybe just start with helping people understand the difference between proof of work, proof of stake and where you think these go?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos [36:18]: Yeah. Proof of work is about connecting currency to the ultimate form of value, which is energy. Everything we do on this planet is underwritten by energy. The food we eat is solar energy captured by photosynthesizing organisms, and then converted up a food chain into other forms of food. The heating in our homes, the ability to transport things around the planet, everything is energy. So in most currencies, the use of energy is mediated between the currency and the underlying energy by institutions that essentially change the exchange rate between energy and currency. So if you think about it, we just have a bigger chain for energy consumption: the US dollar is backed by energy, but instead of being backed directly by energy through proof of work, which is an efficient way of backing it by energy, you do it indirectly by energy. So you burn 100 million barrels of oil in order to wage war on lots of countries to control their oil reserves. You have all of the secondary effects, all of which ultimately consume a lot of energy, in fact in much more polluting ways, to do non-productive functions that act as a backing of the currency. [37:56] And, you know, if you call Bitcoin proof of work, I would call the US dollar proof of war. And that is the most polluting form of energy, and the least beneficial form of energy use we have on the planet. The military is the worst polluter in the country, and by extension in the world. So the idea that Bitcoin is inefficient misses the point, which is that proof of work is a mechanism for providing security in order to make the currency work, that does not have all of the intermediate forms of energy consumption in between the energy and the providing security. And so it\u2019s a much more direct way of providing security for the currency, and unlike traditional currencies, where you don\u2019t get to choose where the energy will be consumed or how it will be produced, Bitcoin actually gravitates to places where energy is overproduced and under-consumed, where you have for most production systems that are not connected to distribution grids. Where you have developing nations that are moving fast and building new capacity without being able to distribute it. Where you have newly launched alternative energy systems: wind, solar, hydro, etc. That again, have overcapacity in production and do not yet have sufficient demand. And in all of those places, Bitcoin gravitates and provides a subsidy that reduces the unit cost of electric production for those systems of energy. So essentially, it\u2019s a subsidy system for solar, wind, hydro, and alternative energy, in places where that development is needed the most. And we\u2019ve seen that in practice. This is not just a speculative thing. We\u2019ve seen that that\u2019s exactly how Bitcoin mining gravitates towards those sources of energy. Now, proof of work is one mechanism of doing it, proof of stake is a different mechanism of doing it, and they have different pros and cons. They\u2019re not exactly substitute mechanisms. They\u2019re not equivalent. What you can do with proof of work is not the same as what you can do with proof of stake. [40:32] Proof of work actually provides you with historical immutability, the ability to cement the past in a way that it cannot be changed, which is incredibly important for a very robust currency. Proof of work also gives you something else, which is that it allows you to bootstrap a currency without a prior distribution mechanism. You see, the thing is, with proof of stake, and let me explain proof of stake briefly \u2014 proof of stake is where, instead of using energy to back the currency, you use the currency by putting down a bond that you will do the security verification for every new transaction that happens. And if you fulfill your promise and do the security correctly, you get a slight reward \u2014 you earn some interest essentially. It\u2019s a bit like using a certificate of deposit or investing in a bond and generation some yield as you maintain the security of the system through audits. So you\u2019re putting down an auditing bond, you\u2019re then auditing the system, and if you audit it successfully according to everybody else\u2019s expectation, then you earn a bit of reward. If you audit it incorrectly, then you lose some of your principal. Here\u2019s the thing: in order to do proof of stake, you need to have the currency that is going to be used to stake already distributed. And of course, in order to do proof of stake fairly\u2014where you don\u2019t have one person or group of people seize control from the very beginning \u2014 you have to have a fairly broad distribution of the currency before you start proof of stake. Well that creates a bit of a chicken and egg problem. You can\u2019t bootstrap a proof of stake system ab initio. You can\u2019t have a virgin birth of a proof of stake system, because, essentially, all of the control is in one group. [42:28] Which is why many proof of stake systems actually bootstrap as proof of work. Proof of work allows you to do a virgin birth, like we had with Bitcoin. You bootstrap it, the proof of work uses a mechanism to distribute the currency based on competition of resources. But here\u2019s the interesting thing: once you\u2019ve done that, you can actually switch to proof of stake if you want to! Ironically, the efforts to perfect proof of stake, to improve, to test at bigger and bigger scale, to put under adversarial trial proof of stake systems\u2014in Ethereum \u2014 is actually an enormous safety mechanism for Bitcoin. And Bitcoin\u2019s proof of work and immutability is an enormous safety mechanism for proof of stake systems. Allow me to explain. One of the difficulties a proof of stake system has is it cannot safeguard the immutability of the past. There\u2019s a type of attack against proof of stake systems called a long-range attack, where, essentially what you can do is you can re-write the past beyond a certain depth for zero cost. Because there\u2019s no way to prove that that past is immutable. In a proof of work system, if you\u2019ve used the energy and then you try to recalculate the past, you have to re-expend the same amount of energy, there\u2019s no shortcut, you can\u2019t do it without proving the proof of work. So if you spent gigawatts to get to today, and you wanted to re-write the past, you\u2019d have to spend those gigawatts again to re-write it. And that preserves the past very robustly, because, of course, you only get rewarded once, but you expend the energy twice if you try to re-write the past. In proof of stake you can\u2019t do that, but you could take proof of stake checkpoints and embed them in a proof of work blockchain that gives you the robust protection of the past and therefore safeguards your proof of stake blockchain from long-range attacks. You can use the proof of work blockchain as an oracle that gives you check-pointing. In fact, a number of chains already do that with Bitcoin. But here\u2019s the other way it works: the key scenario that most people are worried about is: the miners get shut down. Somehow, a government coerces all of the miners into shutting down their operations, or seizes their operations, or takes over and forces them to censor transactions, or whatever. And we find ourselves in a situation where we cannot guarantee that 51% of the mining is in honest hands, which is the prerequisite for maintaining a proof of work chain. Well, there are a number of things that can be done at that point. There can be proof of authority overlays, where you basically say, These miners have acted improperly in the past, we\u2019re not going to accept them. We\u2019re going to vet some of the miners and sign their blocks and only accept those. Tricky to do. But here\u2019s a thought of how we could actually fix this in Bitcoin, which would be to switch to proof of stake, perhaps temporarily, perhaps long-term. You take out all the miners, we switch to proof of stake. The funny thing is that, Bitcoin\u2019s already been distributed. So we\u2019ve already solved the virgin birth problem. We already have Bitcoin holders, who have in their best interest to maintain the honesty of the chain, which means that those people staking their Bitcoin would actually protect the system against proof of work attacks. The thing is, you don\u2019t need to implement that solution for it to be an effective counter-measure. Simply the fact that you can means that an attack against miners is ultimately a failed attack. It involves hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of dollars, in infrastructure, if you\u2019re gonna do a 51% attack. Or it involves expending enormous and strategic capital to compromise and coerce the miners in your state, and then ultimately what that results in is someone nuking your strategic Bitcoin infrastructure from under your feet, and kicking you off the position of power that you had, and now just lost. To achieve what, exactly? Nothing! So, the mere existence of a counter-measure acts to prevent this attack. [47:32] This is a bit like Chekhov\u2019s gun: if you see a gun on the mantle-piece in Act I of a play, someone\u2019s gonna get shot in Act III. The presence of that thing signals what comes next. The fact that we have more than one effective consensus algorithm now prevents an attack against consensus algorithms. Does that make sense?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon: Okay. Yep! So I guess, summarizing that mining centralization argument is a big thing. People always are concerned. Originally, you could fire up a laptop and you could use your computer power to mine Bitcoin. Then it moved to more complex graphic cards, and then it moved to specific machines, and now it\u2019s institutionalized. Firstly, when people say that about 65% of mining happens in China, is that something that actually is true and can be verified? And do you see a scenario where the Chinese government nationalizes all that mining power and Bitcoin becomes Chinacoin?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: So, first of all, there\u2019s no way to actually verify that. People make a gross simplification in most of these arguments. What they say is, 70% of the mining pools are concentrated in China, and then they equate mining pools with mining power, and that\u2019s absolutely not the case. Mining pools are concordia of mining power that concentrate the activity of mining, but they don\u2019t physically exist anywhere. So you can participate with your mining power in any mining pool you want, and most importantly the switching cost of moving from one mining pool to another is zero. So if someone takes over a mining pool and you don\u2019t like how they\u2019re operating, you just switch mining pools, and that\u2019s it! And the mining power drains enormously fast. We\u2019ve seen this happen several times in Bitcoin\u2019s past, where a mining pool has acted suspiciously, or even a rumor has been started that a mining pool might act suspiciously, and the mining power in that pool evaporates overnight, like 95% drop in power overnight. So we know that 70% of the hashrate that presents for mining pools is through mining pools that we see are located in China, because we can identify the location of mining pools. But we don\u2019t know where the actual mining power is. There\u2019s good reason to believe that a chunk of it is in China, probably more than 50%, possibly as big as 70%, but we don\u2019t know that. That\u2019s also not to say that you don\u2019t have pools of mining power that exist in other countries, or that you might not have pools of mining power that can be brought up rather quickly in other countries. The long-term trend has been one of decentralization of mining power. So if you think about it from a numbers perspective, in 2009 there was one miner who had 100% of the hashpower \u2014 Satoshi. And that was the most centralized mining we\u2019ve ever had, but it didn\u2019t matter, because the rule here is that more than 51% must be in honest hands. It doesn\u2019t matter in this case \u2014 one set of hands \u2014 as long as that was honest, it worked. And then it was two, and then it was three, and now we have thousands of miners with machines all around the world. Some estimates in terms of the actual machines is that we\u2019re looking at more than 2 million pieces of hardware devices that are mining. And so from that perspective it\u2019s decentralized, even within China \u2014 I mean China is an enormous country, with a lot of very remote, rural areas where various kinds of deals with local officials generating enormous revenue through the back door are enabled through these mining functions, even if the Chinese government decided, Let\u2019s take down all the miners, this is the conversation I imagine: Hello? Central Party? Yes. Uh, we should do what? Shut down all the miners in our province? Oh. We don\u2019t have any miners in our province. Oh, you found some? We will shut them down immediately. Guys, shut it down for an hour. You know? The problem here is that\u2014yes, okay, China has very very strong controls so that they can expand and extend very strongly all across the country, but we\u2019re talking about money here. And in a centralized system like that where the rule of law is so weak, money has an incredible corrupting influence\u2014the amount of bribes that can be marshaled off of a Bitcoin mine to every layer of official within that area. So, yes it\u2019s possible to shut them all down, but China would want to do that in a very draconian fashion, which of course they might decide to do. But you have to ask Why would they do that? What would they gain exactly? And the truth is that right now, it serves them better to keep that in their back pocket, than basically push the entire industry to the United States and other Western nations, with no hope of seeing it return to their shores ever again, for no reason! It doesn\u2019t really give them any advantage. The final thing is to understand that, taking control of the miners doesn\u2019t allow you to break the rules. If you have control of all of the mining, you still can\u2019t spend Bitcoin that isn\u2019t yours. You still can\u2019t take all of the Bitcoin. You still can\u2019t make transactions pay different people. You can stop the network \u2014 that\u2019s it! And so, in order to do this kind of attack, you have to have one and only one goal, and that is to stop the network. And then it goes into the idea of, if you do that, and you fail to stop the network, what have you proven? You\u2019ve proven that it\u2019s not stoppable. So there\u2019s a very, very big risk in failure there, again as in many attack vectors on Bitcoin. [54:33] That doesn\u2019t mean that China\u2019s not gonna do this \u2014 they might. And this might end up wounding Bitcoin severely and setting it back by years. But I am not of the mind that the development community and the rest of the ecosystem in Bitcoin will simply sit back, let that happen, take no counter-measures whatsoever, and not come back with a torrent of innovation. In fact, quite the opposite. I think that triggers a defense response, which leads me to my final thought on this category of problems, which is: we have to think about this in terms of evolution. This is not a single system battling another single system. This is millions of independent agents in various governments, regulators, and countries, battling millions of individuals with their systems that are dispersed around the world \u2014 software programmers, miners, users, wallets, exchange operators, who have their own interest, right? So if you think about these as two giant populations and you think about them engaging in some kind of battle, then if the predators in that environment create a new attack that finds a vulnerability in the prey, what we know from nature is that that creates an evolutionary response. And what happens when you attack a prey animal is \u2014 depends! Take a look at Australia. You can see there what happens when you have a lot of animals in a very harsh and hostile environment. They become scaly-armored, venomous and poisonous things, so that eventually there are very few cuddly critters in the country, and almost everything can kill you. My theory is this: right now Bitcoin is a gecko. If you start stomping on all the little geckos, you trigger an evolutionary response, and the gecko starts getting bigger, sturdier, scalier, poisonous, angry, and reactive, and what you end up doing is you drive evolution to a Komodo dragon. And if you try to step on a Komodo dragon, it will bite your foot off. So if the governments of the world decide to try an attack like that on Bitcoin, they will drive an evolutionary response, at the protocol level, at the user-interface level, that will make the system stealthy, reactive, evasive, and vicious in response. And that will actually make it unstoppable.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [57:46]: Yep. Okay, next one is quantum computing. Can a quantum computer take down Bitcoin? And is that on the horizon?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: A quantum computer can take money from an elliptic curve digital signature signed transaction, or address, by reversing a public key into a private key. That is not the same as taking down Bitcoin, however. And that is due to a number of innovations that exist in Bitcoin. So first of all, ellptic curve cryptography that is used in Bitcoin is susceptible to quantum analysis \u2014 cryptanalysis. Meaning that, if you have an elliptic curve public key, you can\u2019t get the private key, because that\u2019s the mathematical equivalent of doing division in the elliptic curve domain which is not possible. You would have to try every possible private key in order to find the one that gives you that public key, also known as a brute force attack in the classical computing environment. Therefore, you can\u2019t take a public key, and find the corresponding private key, or take a digital signature and find the corresponding private key. With a quantum computer, however, you can, as long as you have a quantum computer that can actually do calculations at 256 qubits \u2014 actually, I think it\u2019s only 128 because of the nature of quantum cryptanalysis, but you need a lot of qubits. We\u2019re nowhere near getting that many qubits, but let\u2019s say theoretically you did have a computer like that. Well, you could go on the Bitcoin blockchain and you could find any transaction that has a digital signature or public key in it, and you could find the corresponding private key. Now, here\u2019s the interesting thing: digital signatures of public keys don\u2019t appear in Bitcoin until you spend. When you receive Bitcoin, you receive it to an address which is a double-hash. And the public key and digital signature isn\u2019t shown until you spend. So if you\u2019re not re-using Bitcoin addresses, if every time you do a transaction, you use a new address, and if any time you sign for an address, you spend everything that\u2019s in that address and send the change to a new address, when I\u2019ve shown you my public key and my signature, it\u2019s to a private key that no longer controls money, because the reason you saw it is because I just spend it all from there. Which actually really narrows the focus of such an attack. You\u2019d only be able to do it against keys that been re-used. Quantum computing would also not be very effective for breaking SHA-256. So, that\u2019s a whole different domain of problems \u2014 is doing a preimage attack on a hash algorithm. There\u2019s no indication that you can really accelerate that with a quantum computer. As far as I know there are no good algorithms that can do that. So, money in re-used keys would be vulnerable, but at the same time, that\u2019s not the end of Bitcoin, because we can change the signature algorithm. So we can change to a quantum-resistant signature algorithm, and then it\u2019s resistant to quantum computers. In fact, if quantum computing is widespread, if I can have it in my ThinkPad, then I can use a quantum digital signature that cannot be broken by a quantum computer. If I can sign with a quantum computer then you can\u2019t break it with a quantum computer. So we just upgrade everything to quantum-capable systems. The bottom line is that if you think of Bitcoin as a completely static system, where everybody publishes all of their digital signatures \u2014yes, that\u2019s vulnerable to a quantum computer. But that\u2019s not what Bitcoin is! It\u2019s a system where we don\u2019t publish our signatures until we empty an address, for the most part. And then it\u2019s also a system that can evolve, we can change the signature algorithm. In fact, the very next upgrade in Bitcoin that is being planned right now \u2014 it\u2019s called Taproot \u2014 it\u2019s a collection of changes that is being planned for 2021 introduction into the Bitcoin code base, [that] includes a new signature algorithm called Schnorr signatures. The fact that we can go from elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA), to Schnorr signatures and have both of those systems work in parallel, simply demonstrate the fact that we could also have another, and a fourth, and a fifth, and a sixth signature algorithm all co-existing. And we can evolve them over time. So, as long as the system continues to evolve and as long as quantum computers are not capable of doing the amount of qubits that are needed to break our key lengths, we are not only safe, but we can stay ahead of this game.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [01:03:08]: Okay. And then just help us understand. If someone had such a quantum computer, what other things in the world except for Bitcoin would be affected by that? Would this affect the security of our bank accounts? Or is it just something that would affect Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Every system of encryption on the planet is immediately vulnerable, which means all of the web security certificates, SSL, all of the bank to bank communications, all of the embassy communications, all of the communications with the nuclear submarines, all of the communications with aircraft, all of the communications at every level. All of encryption breaks if you have a quantum computer. Which, interestingly enough, then makes this the most important secret in the world. And, it\u2019s the one that you keep dry until you need it. So let\u2019s say for example that the NSA created a quantum computer with enough qubit capacity to break other governments\u2019 communication secrets. Well, at that point you don\u2019t want to use it. And if you do use it, you want to have the ability to do what\u2019s called parallel construction. Meaning that, you need to have a cover story. So if someone says, Hang on a second. It appears they know that we were going to be in the Red Square at noon exchanging this diplomatic envelope. Did they break our communications? No, probably not. They probably got it by beating up Yuri last week. You need an \u201cother\u201d story that\u2019s more plausible than, They have a quantum computer that can read all of our messages. We actually have a historical parallel to this: between 1941 and 1944, the Allies broke Enigma, the German, the Axis encryption computer machine that was being used by Germans to control submarine fleets, to communicate about air raids, etc. They broke this in England at a place called Bletchley Park under the leadership of Alan Turing, the father of computer science. And then this became the most important secret in the war, because they could now read the German communications \u2014 not immediately, not all of them, but enough and fast enough that they could actually take action. So they had to then construct a complete intelligence system that ensured that for every lead that they followed, they had a cover story that gave a better explanation than, Enigma is broken, so that the Germans wouldn\u2019t stop using the Enigma machine. And in fact there\u2019s a specific example in the war when the Allies found out that Coventry was about to be bombed with one of the biggest raids in the war, and they had the choice between preventing possibly tens of thousands of deaths in the city of Coventry, and revealing \u2014 and they didn\u2019t have a good cover story. And so they decided to let the Germans bomb Coventry and not warn anyone. So, Bitcoin is the attack that doesn\u2019t have a good cover story. You start seeing coins from years ago moving that nobody thinks anyone can break the keys \u2014 the idea starts growing in your mind that maybe someone out there has a quantum computer capable of breaking ECDSA. Which then creates a worldwide scramble to migrate away from quantum vulnerable encryption systems, and it complete de-fangs that very important intelligence tool. So if someone had such a tool or is able to build such a tool, more likely, over the next 15 years, they would be very smart not to use it on Bitcoin, and instead to keep it, and hold it, and to pretend that such a thing doesn\u2019t exist, and to use it only under dire circumstances.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [01:07:23]: Okay. What about developer centralization? So over the years we\u2019ve seen politics within the Bitcoin space with significant developers that have more influence and maybe they own the \u2014 well it\u2019s open source, but someone controls the GitHub passwords. And we\u2019ve seen claims that certain developers from within an organization like Blockstream \u2014 when they have more influence over the Bitcoin code, and that you could have a corporate takeover. How do we protect, and what\u2019s the risk of a few key developers making some malicious attacks or being compromised or being ransomed in order to do something?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: Well, the first and biggest defense is that this system is an open source system, which means that anyone can and thousands of people do, inspect all of the code changes that go into Bitcoin. I read GitHub blogs. I follow \u2014 not all \u2014 but many of the conversations that are happening on the developer mailing list, in the developer IRC, and in the GitHub pull requests, which are the requests for changes that are happening and publicly discussed. And you can read the code and see what exactly is being changed, how, and why? There is a very, very small possibility that someone could sneak a code change in there that has an unintended side effect that is not immediately obvious. But again, this is a decentralized system, so you change the code of Bitcoin Core \u2014 does that change the security of wallets that don\u2019t depend on Bitcoin Core? Nope! So there is no central piece of code that is used everywhere in Bitcoin, other than the mining functions. The core consensus algorithms which are very, very, very carefully scrutinized, and of course, even there, people don\u2019t only run one code base. They run a couple of different code bases, they\u2019re very slow to upgrade, and they take their time to make sure there are no problems, not because they\u2019re expecting back doors, but because they expect bugs that inevitably happen. And if you lose money because of a bug, it doesn\u2019t hurt or sting any less or more than losing it through a back door. So open source code creates an environment in which it is very difficult to introduce changes. The ecosystem around Bitcoin uses a variety of code bases at different levels within the application stack, and they\u2019re written independently in differently languages by different people, and they\u2019re all scrutinizing the main rules that run in consensus and interacting with them and running a barrage of programming tests on those rules to know if something has changed that\u2019s going to affect their software. So, can a programmer introduce a back door? Not really. And they\u2019d have to introduce it in a way to goes unnoticed, and spreads widely, and then gets adopted by multiple stacks, and then can be executed in such a way that causes widespread damage that can\u2019t be fixed by patching or even rolling back the chain. That\u2019s a lot of ifs. And so if you think about it from a probability perspective, the probability of the first thing happening is 10%, the probability of the second thing happening is 10%, so 10% times 10% is 1% \u2014 the probability of the third thing happening \u2014 so you have an exponential decay of probability with every step that you add to this chain. This is why conspiracy theories don\u2019t work. It\u2019s because the probabilities multiply in a way that exponentially decreases the chance of it succeeding. [01:11:49] So, no, you can\u2019t do that. On the other hand, can you create an environment in which development is hijacked in such a way that others can\u2019t develop alternative paths or follow alternative attempts to develop the code or disagree with big decisions. I think that was answered conclusively in August of 2017. And the answer is, that although development teams can build their own, and can fork off from Bitcoin, and then can solicit the businesses, the owners, the wallets, the exchanges, etc., to follow their version. Now, you\u2019re gonna hear a lot of people say, but censorship and bullying prevented this from succeeding, and I don\u2019t believe that, because when Bitcoin started, nobody believed in it, it was absolutely censored everywhere, there was plenty of bullying from major financial circles, and yet Bitcoin did succeed, because it could succeed on the merits. And I would argue that alternative teams that have tried to implement changes to the Bitcoin code, have failed on the merits, because they have failed to maintain it, to develop features that people actually want, to follow the conservative ethos that the market is demonstrating through its choices whether you agree with it or not, and have failed to appeal to the businesses, and the users in the ecosystem to follow them. But, if it was in fact the case, that the developers tried to pull a coup, where they try to push changes or prevent changes that were broadly desired \u2014 they would fail on the merits. Other people could very easily bootstrap that code, run it independently with the changes that they want, and maintain it by attracting the best talent in the space. And, you know, we can talk about all of the conspiracies for why that happened for some of the forks for Bitcoin. But the bottom line is that that represents a supreme lack of faith in the ability of the market to discern the merits of different solutions. And I trust the market, bottom line. There is no amount of censorship that could make a solution that is inferior and peer to peer. Not over the long term.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [01:14:33]: Okay. We\u2019re getting into one more and then I\u2019m gonna leave with one question. So Satoshi, the million Bitcoin, moving some of those coins? What\u2019s the likelier of that?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: I mean it\u2019s possible at some point that that happens. I think it\u2019s extremely unlikely. Honestly, we don\u2019t know if Satoshi is still alive, quite honestly. And we certainly don\u2019t know if they still have control and access to the keys in order to use them. This is unknown. An unknown doesn\u2019t mean that I think they\u2019re not alive, or I think they don\u2019t have control. It really does mean unknown, they might, they might not, there is zero possibility of going one way or another, because we don\u2019t have the information to make that determination. So, from that perspective, there is a possibility, but that possibility gets slimmer with time, meaning that, Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared since 2010 and none of the Bitcoin has ever moved. 10 years later, that fact, not only hasn\u2019t changed, but it\u2019s had 10 years piled on top of it. So if you follow the general logic year, every year that passes cements the probability that they\u2019re not going to move. If they did move, it would be a shock to the system, for sure. It would be a shock to the system because it would demonstrate one of two possibilities: one, that Satoshi Nakamoto\u2019s keys have been accessed, and someone controls them and is able to move, either Satoshi themselves, or somebody who managed to get access to those keys, inherit TXs to those keys, find those keys, whatever. The second possibility, ironically, goes back to the previous discussion that we had, which is that a quantum computer has cracked those keys. Especially with some of the early keys, they are paid to public keys so the public key is visible, and the money\u2019s sitting in them. So, therefore, a quantum computer, its first target, its juiciest target, its easiest to attack target, is the Satoshi stash. So, how do we know if a quantum computer exists that can break ECDSA? Simple! Satoshi\u2019s coins start moving. In fact at some point after a decade or so, it might actually be the more likely explanation. So you see the coins moving and you\u2019re like, Did Satoshi come back from the dead? Or, did a quantum computer emerge that can break these? As the years go by, I start leaning more towards, Okay, it appears that a quantum computer has emerged that can do this. But I think we\u2019re still a decade away from that. It would cause a massive amount of volatility in the space by injecting an enormous amount of liquidity on the supply side of Bitcoin. But it would also once and for all resolve the question, and so you probably know\u2014I think this is characteristic of markets \u2014 which is, what\u2019s the thing? Sell the rumor, buy the fact? The fact that there\u2019s uncertainty, can cause a lot of volatility. Something starts happening, but it\u2019s unexpected. The markets react badly. But as soon as that becomes expected, you get the opposite reaction. The markets go, Oh, well, I guess Satoshi\u2019s coins moved. Bitcoin didn\u2019t die completely, its price dipped. Well now, Bitcoin, at whatever price it\u2019s priced in now, is a Bitcoin in which Satoshi\u2019s coins have moved, and are therefore part of the supply and priced in. Therefore, its future is now certain. That is no longer hanging over it. Which, usually, traders react to very optimistically at that point, because you remove that big chunk of uncertainty. Sometimes, having the bad news confirmed, leads to a rally in the markets, because you went from uncertainty, to confirmation, even though what\u2019s being confirmed is bad news.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon [01:19:22]: Okay, so I think this is a nice place to conclude it up. I think it seems like the biggest risk to Bitcoin is that Bitcoin becomes so statistically and geopolitically significant in the world that a coordinated effort by all the governments all around the world, and the IMF and the World Bank and the Bank of International Settlement all get together and they create their central bank world global digital currency, and simultaneously invent a quantum computer, and attack the Satoshi keys. And that seems like the risk that Bitcoin fails. If that\u2019s not it, what, in your consideration, is the biggest risk to Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Andreas Antonopoulos: The biggest risk to Bitcoin in my opinion is fragmentation within the community and a dilution of the fundamental principles. The biggest risk in Bitcoin is that people who are in Bitcoin already, forget why we got into it, and get seduced by the possibility of riches to sell out all of the principles that make Bitcoin special, and basically hand the baton to something that replaces Bitcoin because it actually achieves the principles that Bitcoin espouses more effectively. We give up on privacy, fungibility, censorship resistance, neutrality, borderless operation, open access, limited monetary supply. We start giving up on those principles one by one, compromising and turning Bitcoin into more and more and more of a Disney version of Bitcoin, right? We polish the rough edges, we take off the sharp corners, we make it more palatable to the investors, we make it more suitable for PayPal to do KYC, we introduce controls so that the IMF if more comfortable with it, we make it so that they are more and more comfortable with it, which makes it less and less effective. Bitcoin doesn\u2019t get attacked if it doesn\u2019t threaten anything. So one way to stop it from getting attacked is to make it completely unthreatening, by removing its fangs, by disarming it, by making it useless. And that can only happen from the inside. That can only happen by capitulation of the principles by those who are invested in it, and who decide that, in the end this wasn\u2019t about creating a system where we don\u2019t have rulers. In the end this wasn\u2019t about creating a system without intermediaries. In the end it was simply about replacing the corrupt intermediaries, rulers, and controllers of the past, with me, you, or whoever else, because that\u2019s greed, right? And so, when people say, how about we just make me in charge, and then we don\u2019t need to worry about not having anyone in charge? That\u2019s how these systems fail. Honestly at this point, given the fact that the recipe of Bitcoin, the concept, its implications, and the ideas and principles behind it have become so widespread and so easy to replicate, I think that that kills Bitcoin, but it doesn\u2019t kill the movement that Bitcoin started. If the community capiulates its principles, all that will do is, they\u2019ll get replaced by a system that doesn\u2019t capitulate those principles. Some other system manages to be more principled than Bitcoin and becomes the new Bitcoin. And in many ways, as I\u2019ve said before, there is a strong possibility at that point that we simply name this new system Bitcoin, and pretend that nothing changed. The brand itself might survive the instance of the technology, if it still carries the principles.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Simon Dixon: Okay, awesome! I think that\u2019s a great place to end. So it\u2019s the principles that are the biggest risk to Bitcoin, and even then the Bitcoin brand might out-survive the people that are implementing their principles into what we would today call Bitcoin. Andreas I really thank you for your time, whenever it comes to these technical subjects, I strongly recommend everyone check out all your content, and I just want to thank you for the service that you\u2019ve done to Bitcoin and the industry as an educator and just helping people understand so many of these complex subjects over the years.

{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah sure thing, thanks for having me on. So if we wanna go through my whole biography, I really think it starts in 2005, which is probably long before Bitcoin was written. And I got interested in Libertarianism through Wikipedia. I\u2019ve learned most of the things I know through Wikipedia probably, not through school. So I went down that rabbit hole and became a gold bug, and I was into silver.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: What brought you to be a gold bug in 2005 though? I know it starts there, but what is turning you on about gold and hard money at whatever age you are?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Oh yeah, for sure. So I was a junior in high school, and I was reading about Libertarianism I came across this Austrian economics website called mises.org. And I subscribed to their newsletter [01:41] and so I would get this in my inbox, and one of the topics they would talk about is the business cycle. And the business cycle is a macroeconomic phenomenon that the Austrian school has done research on long before the global financial crisis in 2008. There was a lot of research done on what causes instability in the financial system and really the conclusion I came to from reading the material they were putting out was that it\u2019s a combination of fractional reserve banking and central banking that causes the business cycle to happen. And the only solution to that is to take the power of the printing press out of the hands of the government, out of the hands of central authorities. And the closest, the least-worst solution, in my mind, was 100% reserve banking with gold. And that\u2019s kind of where I was at probably around 2006. And even before I learned about Bitcoin, or before it existed, I did theorize about, hypothetically, one could have a money with an absolutely fixed supply. [02:51] And that that would actually be better than gold, because people produce gold every day. But I wasn\u2019t a computer scientist or anything. So in college I majored in Accounting, I started my career at Deloitte doing audits of mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities and all that stuff. Crazy fiat finance stuff. In any case, I learned about Bitcoin twice: the first time I heard about it was on Slashdot, so I was already, even in high school, when I was learning about Libertarianism, I was also learning about open source software, and learning how to install Linux on my computer, listening to Richard Stallman lectures about how free software is great for users.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: What were you trying to do with all this knowledge?

I had a few friends but it was pretty much just me on the Internet trying to figure out what\u2019s going on in the world. The other thing is that, from moving between France and the US, I think that I became kind of political in the sense that I saw how people could have radically different views of what makes the economy run.

And that they wanted to create an aristocratic ruling class that could directly tax the people in the United States, and also issue bonds and benefit the commercial interests of financiers and people like Alexander Hamilton that we make musicals about being heroes today, but that there was kind of an underlying profit motive to the whole operation.

Whereas, the historians look at what conversations are going on in Parliament and in King George\u2019s cabinet, and it\u2019s just a completely different story. That, in reality, they were just trying to figure out how to balance the finances of this empire, and keep enemies at bay, and kind of just keep everyone happy. It\u2019s not like they were out to get anyone. It\u2019s like, if you went to Afghanistan today, the Afghanis probably have misconceptions about why the United States is there, and what their true intent is, right? [07:46] They probably think that, like, They\u2019re here to steal our minerals, they\u2019re here to steal our resources, they\u2019re here to grow drugs. And maybe some of that is going on, but fundamentally the political motive is, We got attacked on 9/11, and then we can \u2014 we don\u2019t have to go into CIA blowback in Saudia Arabia and all that. So that\u2019s my more nuanced view. But again, I have no way of verifying this, right? I can\u2019t run an American Revolutionary War full node and download the history of it and verify it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [08:17]: You don\u2019t have a secured history truth machine."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: No, yeah so it\u2019s all \u2014 I don\u2019t know who\u2019s right or wrong. And I just gotta take it at face value.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: So back to those two moments with Bitcoin. The a-ha moments I\u2019m assuming. For you, maybe it was like, someone in old times who was looking at different rocks and finally came across gold. They knew they were looking for it, so it seems like it was a bit of the case for you. Can you tell us about those two times?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah, so the first time was on Slashdot and Slashdot was kind of like what the Y Combinator News was back in the day, of like, tech-geek information, and it was right up my alley because I was into Linux and open source and whatnot, and computers \u2014 I built my own PC and whatnot. So I saw a post that was about the Silk Road, and about Bitcoin mining. It was a combo post. And I thought it was interesting because I was interested in money, but I didn\u2019t dig into it because I automatically assumed that the unit, the monetary unit, was not scarce. And so it was like, Oh okay, well if there\u2019s Bitcoin mining and you can just create more, and then you can go spend it to buy drugs? Okay, that\u2019s not super interesting to me, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I still get the same blowback today at barbecues."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah! And then when I found out about it again in the end of 2012, my first reaction \u2014 well, so, I found out about the 21 million Bitcoin. And I was like, Oh! Okay, this is like the perfect monetary policy, that\u2019s really interesting. But ultimately there\u2019s \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: But how did you, on Slashdot, you found out about the 21 million as well? Or that was the second time?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: No, no, no. The second time I was debating in college, I was part of the Mises Circle with Michael Goldstein and Daniel Krawisz, and we were talking about 100% reserve banking, fractional reserve banking, and debating it, and yeah it just came up in that context. I think its price was also going up, and so there was like a little bit of buzz among these uh, nerdy Libertarians. And so my reaction though was that cryptography is always vulnerable. That you can always break cryptography. That was my view, I didn\u2019t know any better. [10:46] And Daniel Krawisz was like, No!\u2014and he had a Masters in Physics and was getting his Masters in Software or something, so he was my authority figure on this particular topic, I disagree with him on a lot today \u2014 No! That there is such a thing as hard cryptography. And so that\u2019s what persuaded me.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [11:20]: So you\u2019re learning about Bitcoin, you have your two moments you come across it, it seems like as a group, I mean, I kind of consider you and Goldstein the McCartney and Lennon of Bitcoin at this point."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: So yeah, Daniel and Bitstein had been on Mt. Gox. I went on Mt. Gox\u2014I might have created an account, but when I realized that I had to wire money to Japan? I was a broke college student. I was like, I can\u2019t wire $100 to Japan \u2014 that\u2019s insane!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Drop it off at a CVS. They were doing, like drop-checks at CVSs I think back then."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah. So I didn\u2019t even dig into it further than that. I was just like, Okay, I\u2019ll just have to figure out some other way to get it. And eventually BitInstant came around and I was able to buy some through BitInstant using a Wallmart red phone. But the mining\u2014you know, the first time around that I heard about Bitcoin, I actually did download Bitcoin and try mining. I didn\u2019t realize that I had to go into the command line and do a command to start mining. I thought it would be in the GUI, and when I didn\u2019t see the button, I kind of just closed it. I was like, whatever. I didn\u2019t go Google how to mine.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [13:02]: Back then were you spending or trading your Bitcoin? Or losing it? Or just holding it?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: No, no. So \u2014 broke college student, so buying tiny amounts from BitInstant. Eventually Coinbase came around, and I remember, during the Cyprus thing, the price went on this price mania to $270 at the beginning of 2013. And, at that point I was euphoric. First of all, I owned very little Bitcoin. But, I knew ideologically that this was succeeding, that it was gaining traction, and that maybe this would actually cause a financial crisis. I thought that there might be a currency crisis brewing, because Bitcoin was going from $20 to $270. And for me it was like, Okay, this is like a 10x in three months.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Right, right. Are you telling your family about it? Your friends? No-coiners?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: I remember, yeah, telling my parents, This is the future of money. And, you know, they had heard me say crazy stuff before, because I was a crazy Libertarian. And they were like, Oh, okay. Alright.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: And how has their views changed on it since then? Or people around you? Are they more interested? Do they still think you\u2019re out in left-field? Where do they stand?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [14:24]: Yeah so at the time I actually did send my dad some Bitcoin because\u2014he\u2019s in semiconductors, and so, he knows C++. So when he read the white paper, it did make sense to him, and he was interested in it. But I mostly focused on the Internet. Because to me, rather than trying to evangelize door to door\u2014and we talked about it, I remember having a conversation with Michael Goldstein. We were like, We\u2019ve gotta go to all the merchants in town! And we gotta tell them about Bitcoin! Because, when they hear about Bitcoin\u2014that there\u2019s no fees \u2014 they\u2019re gonna instantly adopt Bitcoin, and we\u2019re gonna have hyperbitcoinization in Austin, Texas, because of us! Us two! And, you know, that\u2019s probably a lot of people\u2019s first intuitions when they enter this space of like, Ah! Well! This is gonna be easy\u2014this thing sells itself! But, I quickly realized that the people who are going to be most interested at the margin in Bitcoin, are just going to be random people on the Internet who, like me, stumbled onto it. Like I didn\u2019t have someone come tell me about it and hand me a pamphlet.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [15:39]: Sure. But you did have like-minded people around you way back in the day, which is rare."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: But there\u2019s something in the water, it\u2019s probably bad fluoride or something that causes Austin people to be interested in conspiracy theories and things like that. So that\u2019s a huge advantage. But the Internet is like that too.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [16:15]: Yeah. It seems like Libertarianism is a big part of your path to Bitcoin and hard money, and a big part of your life. With the recent news with Dr. Ron Paul\u2014was he influential in your life?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah, absolutely. By the time I had heard Ron Paul\u2019s name, I was already pretty well steeped in Austrian economics. I was already an anarcho-capitalist, so, basically\u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Can you talk a little bit about that? What does that mean to you, or the world?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: The central concept is that, if we take the proposition that nobody should commit acts of violence or aggression against other people \u2014 if we just take that to its logical extreme, then there really shouldn\u2019t be a state that has a monopoly on aggression, because we\u2019ve ruled out the possibility, or the legitimacy, of ever there being aggression that is not in self-defense. So that just excludes the possibility of a state. And so I do take that proposition seriously. Now the secondary question is, Ok, How would that be enforceable? How would we prevent the state from committing acts of aggression? Because, ultimately, whoever is strongest is gonna be able to assert and defend their rights. And, if we look at human history there was a turning point when we had firearms. That\u2019s when we actually were able to have rights that were enforceable by the citizenry against the warrior class in society. Because now, even a female who is very weak, or a male who is very weak \u2014 I don\u2019t wanna be sexist, is able to own a firearm and level the playing field with someone who wields a broadsword, or has a giant axe. And that was kind of a huge deal in human development. And so that technology leveled the playing field. And now, obviously, there are people trying to undo that because what happens when you have broad ownership of firearms is that, there\u2019s negative externalities of crime, but there\u2019s also positive externalities of \u2014 there\u2019s going to be limits to state power, and you can\u2019t just go full totalitarian, communist Chinese surveillance state. Conceivably \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll see. We can argue about the NSA or whatever. [19:03] So there\u2019s that technology, and so from that insight of \u2014 the less it costs for individuals to defend themselves from aggression, then the less aggression there\u2019s going to be. And so I think it actually goes even further into \u2014 now, in the Digital Age, where cameras are a big part of that, so phones that have cameras on them. I think phones with cameras on them are going to reduce the amount of violence inflicted by, for example, police officers, right? So Rodney King \u2014 Rodney King happened way worse, lots more times before there was video, before the invention of video, and before the costs of video came down low enough that you could have a helicopter with video. And so there\u2019s so many parts to this, right? And it\u2019s kind of the same thing actually during the Civil Rights movement. When video came out of white police officers using dogs against black protesters, and using hoses against peaceful black protesters, this actually shocked the nation, right? That, Wait, hold on, these people are just marching in the street, why are you attacking them unprovoked? That\u2019s completely unacceptable. They have first amendment rights, you can\u2019t just attack people like this. And if it was white people on the receiving end of it, it would just not stand, right? So I do think that technology has a huge influence on our ability to assert rights, both in terms of kinetic \u2014 shooting a bullet, but also in terms of psychological warfare and mass media and the ability to publicize abuse and whatnot. Now, okay, so let\u2019s take it to cryptography and Bitcoin. Well, so we can apply this concept to gold as well. Alright, I\u2019m going on a wild tangent here because we\u2019re talking about anarcho-capitalism, but basically the idea is that I think that the technological progress is going to allow us to reach an anarcho-capitalist society, where we no longer actually need the state to enforce property rights, because we\u2019ll have autonomous robots that will physically remove you from the property if you invade someone\u2019s home.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: What kind of time-frame are you thinking there?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [21:15]: Oh, probably like the next 50 years.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: 50 years, yeah. One of my dark fears is around emergent intelligence, and the abilities of that, and I wonder if\u2014and I love Bitcoin to death \u2014 but, one of my dark fears is that maybe Bitcoin is a form of emergent intelligence that will one day be able to hire the AI-driven creatures that will one day domesticate us. Because it is its own life form."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah, that\u2019s where sovereignty is so important. That\u2019s where it\u2019s really important that it be your software, you\u2019re running the node software, and then, we can think about all the contingencies around that, like having a Blockstream satellite dish to increase your censorship resistance.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Sure \u2014 meshnets, things of that sort."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [21:58]: Yeah. And I do think that right now we\u2019re very reliant on ISPs, and now\u2014again, technology, right? Elon Musk is setting up a network of low-earth orbit satellites that are going to allow us to have high-speed Internet through a satellite network, which is going to increase the censorship-resistance of the Internet, and give everyone in the world access to Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah, that sounds awesome. Right now I\u2019d like to jump into\u2014like, if you could lay out your case for the Bitcoin investment thesis? I know you\u2019re an expert on the investment case for Bitcoin. Maybe a little bit \u2014 guide it for a pre-coiner or a new-coiner? And right off the bat, I love your Tweet about, Bitcoin is savings technology. I think it\u2019s brilliant! One of the things I run into there though is, unfortunately, most people don\u2019t have a lot of savings. [22:53] And what \u201csavings\u201d they do have is maybe in their 401(k), so it\u2019s not really liquid or tappable. It\u2019s not true savings \u2014 it\u2019s an investment. And it\u2019s hard to turn someone on, you know, when you talk about maybe DCA or $10 a week. I tell people, Buy two Starbucks worth a week. That being said, if you could walk through your investment case, that would be great."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [23:15]: Basically, I\u2019ll explain why I\u2019m bullish on Bitcoin, and then I\u2019ll explain how to approach it from a personal finance perspective. So I think that Bitcoin is going through this process of going from having zero value to having all of the monetary value in the world. So then we can think about Where is the monetary value currently? And Why is that monetary value going to transfer to Bitcoin? So where it is currently is primarily in US dollars, and US dollar-denominated government debt (treasuries). After gold, the US dollar was able to become the world reserve currency. And so, today, the entire international monetary system and international financial system is centered around the dollar. Everything from: having contracts be dollar-denominated, to, the most liquid equities and derivatives exchanges are all in the US and in dollar and all of that. Basically, the reason you end up with a world reserve currency \u2014 and before, it was gold in various forms \u2014 is that the whole point of a money is that people don\u2019t have to barter. And so you have one singular asset that is the most liquid asset that people are going to use for what economists call indirect exchange. Where, it\u2019s not so much that I\u2019m trading with you because I need what you have, it\u2019s: I\u2019m trading with you because I need money that I\u2019m going to then go spend somewhere else with someone who has what I need. So indirect exchange\u2014in the free market process \u2014 one good is going to reach the top of the liquidity stack. So it\u2019s gonna have to have certain properties. I would argue that the most important property that it would have is that it\u2019d have some form of verifiable scarcity. So why is that? Well, with a medium of exchange, you don\u2019t really want an abundant amount of it, otherwise it\u2019s not going to hold any value because people are just going to create more of it. [25:41] Whereas, with a commodity, you kind of want an infinite amount of it \u2014 ideally, we would have an infinite amount of oil, right? We don\u2019t want scarce oil, right? In fact, we\u2019re concerned about peak oil. We\u2019re concerned about scarce oil, it\u2019s a problem for civilization. We can talk about global warming, but that\u2019s a different conversation. Whereas, with a money, we would be concerned about too much money being created and inflation, whereas with too little money being created \u2014 now we can debate this, because Keynesians think that that\u2019s a problem \u2014 of deflation, of prices going down. In any case, if we go back to gold versus the dollar and verifiable scarcity, the dollar combined two technologies which allowed it to have better verifiable scarcity than gold. The first one was paper money that actually could not be counterfeited, or where the cost of counterfeiting that paper money was greater than the actual value of the money itself. The cost of making a perfect replica of a $100 bill is greater than a hundred dollars. [26:53] And that cost includes the risk of getting caught and being put in prison! So there\u2019s definitely\u2014the ability to have rule of law, and to have nobody be above the law, enforces the US dollar\u2019s verifiable scarcity. The other part of the equation was the emergence of an institutional technology called independent central banking. Before independent central banking, you had central banks that were either fully controlled by the commercial system \u2014 by banks \u2014 or they were fully controlled by the sovereign \u2014 by the government, or by the prince, or by the Roman emperor \u2014 we can go that far back. But you didn\u2019t have an independent central bank in the Roman Empire or anything like that, and so they would get themselves in trouble where they would start out with having a gold coin, and then they would start diluting it, and what they would do is they monopolized mints \u2014 they nationalized the mints, because the mints provide the verification technology in gold. It\u2019s way too expensive to take gold nuggets and to verify that they\u2019re pure gold, right? You have to standardize the gold using a minting technology \u2014 and mints used to be private, where it was like a brand like Kellogg\u2019s or whatever \u2014 but governments took it over because they understood strategically, if you want to pay for the war machine, it\u2019s nice to have access to a mint. [28:32] And it\u2019s nice to be able to dilute things out and to pay your troops with diluted coin and all this. In any case, that verification technology was easily co-opted. Now, let\u2019s contrast all these with Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, you run your software on your computer that does this verification. So, you don\u2019t have to trust a mint, you don\u2019t have to trust a government, and you don\u2019t have to trust an independent central bank, and you don\u2019t have to trust a counterfeit bill detector. All you have to trust is the developers \u2014 and you don\u2019t even really have to trust them either, because it\u2019s open-source. So if you have the software development chops, you can go and audit the code yourself and look things over, or, write the code yourself, right? People have done that, they\u2019ve written their own implementation of a Bitcoin node. So you don\u2019t even really have to trust anyone, at the end of the day. Some people say you have to trust Intel, because we\u2019re all running this on Intel processors. [29:25] We can go down that rabbit hole if you want.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Fair enough. What do you think about, like, when there are threats? People will say, Can the government ban or co-opt Bitcoin? What do you think about that? I don\u2019t believe in that. And obviously Bitcoin is agnostic. But, you know, as a US citizen who owns KYC\u2019d Bitcoin \u2014 it\u2019s a small concern."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah, so they\u2019re searching for drugs, okay? So already it\u2019s like, Why? Why are you guys doing that? There\u2019s no reason to be doing that. The number one drug dealer in the US is Big Pharma. They\u2019re the ones who are pushing opiates onto people, and then the tax-payers are paying for all of these opiates, so it\u2019s pretty crazy that the government thinks it has any kind of moral high ground on this topic. But anyways, they\u2019re searching for drugs, I guess, maybe they\u2019re anti-competition, right? They\u2019re trying to prevent competition with Big Pharma. And, you know, these are white police officers. To them, they\u2019re kind of in a foreign country when they go and attack drug dealers, and attack their families. [34:57] They\u2019re an occupying force, and that\u2019s why you see them wear military fatigues. They get into tactical gear, they get inside of armored personnel carriers, with 50-caliber sniper rifles, like \u2014 they\u2019re in Iraq as far as they\u2019re concerned. A lot of them are Iraq vets, and they might have PTSD or otherwise unresolved psychological problems, and also they have all these legal protections that we talked about so they can do no wrong. So they go to people\u2019s houses, they do these things called no-knock warrants. So I mentioned the dangers of someone saying that they\u2019re police, but they don\u2019t even have to say they\u2019re police. So they\u2019re just, like, busting people\u2019s doors down and not announcing themselves, not serving a warrant, not getting on the loudspeaker and saying, Hey! Come out with your hands up! We\u2019ve got your house surrounded \u2014 we think you\u2019re a criminal! That\u2019s like what a normal police would do\u2014You\u2019re under arrest! Sorry we have to do this! But instead, they blow down people\u2019s front doors, and then they got shot at \u2014 obviously, they\u2019re gonna get shot at, because you have heavily armed civilians who are interested in protecting their families from violent criminals. And there\u2019s a violent criminal blowing down their door, so I don\u2019t understand why they don\u2019t expect to shot? [36:34] If you\u2019re busting down someone\u2019s door, your primary expectation should be that they\u2019re gonna shoot at you immediately, and they have every right to! Of course they do! You haven\u2019t even announced yourselves. And then they start shooting back, and they kill your girlfriend, and that\u2019s what happened with Breonna Taylor. And then the prosecutor, he filed charges against the police officers for the bullets that missed Breonna Taylor, because the bullets went into other homes, and they said that was reckless. Anyway, maybe this is more about Libertarianism than about Bitcoin.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [37:18]: Which is great. I kind of want to circle to the Austrian perspective around price as a signal in the marketplace, and the value that it communicates, and how it\u2019s a language unto itself. If you could maybe elaborate on that, and maybe using the stock market as an example, especially with what\u2019s going on today?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [37:38]: Yeah. In mainstream economics, Hayek is kind of known for this, but it precedes Hayek and it transcends Hayek, which is Price as decentralized information. It\u2019s basically the output of the process between supply and demand, and there\u2019s two levels to it. And people who know about trading know this. There\u2019s the order book, where it\u2019s kind of the prices at which people are willing to buy and sell goods. And so everyone\u2019s walking around with an order book in their head\u2014for basically every single service and good under the sun, right? Where people are gonna say, Yeah, I would pay $5 for a ticket to the moon, if that was offered. I wouldn\u2019t pay $5 million\u2014I mean I can\u2019t afford $5 million for anything, so that\u2019s out of reach. And so there\u2019s no clearing price. On the other hand, you go to the supermarket and toothpaste might be $3, and you\u2019re like, Okay, well I\u2019d be willing to pay $10 for toothpaste, but if they\u2019re gonna sell it to me for $3, that\u2019s fine too, I won\u2019t argue with them. And then \u2014 you have a deal! Now the value of the toothpaste you\u2019re buying is greater than its price. And so that\u2019s why you\u2019re gonna go buy it. And that\u2019s a market buy. If you know about order books, you know the difference between limit orders \u2014 which is the price you\u2019re willing to pay \u2014 and the market order \u2014 where it\u2019s just the price you\u2019re gonna pay right now, and you\u2019re gonna put down some cash for it. And then the producers of goods also have limit order books, where the toothpaste manufacturer knows that, Okay, in order to manufacture this toothpaste, we\u2019re gonna have to put $2 of cost into it, and then we also want to have some profit margins, so let\u2019s put it at $3 or whatever. Although really, actually, that\u2019s not how they should set prices. How they should set prices is: What is the market willing to bear? How high of a price can we charge people before they start complaining and going to our competitors? [39:51] And so that\u2019s kind of how the market actually functions in some cases. In other cases, it\u2019s more of like a cost-plus type situation, and it really depends on how defensible of a market position do they have? How strong is their brand? Because if they\u2019ve got a weak brand, then they can\u2019t charge a premium. Apple can charge 50% profit margins, because, at what price-point do you decide, I\u2019m not gonna buy an iPhone, I\u2019m gonna buy an Android instead? Apparently it\u2019s like a thousand dollars! Because that\u2019s where the current price of a good iPhone is, you know? Now, obviously you can get a used iPhone for a lot less, and so maybe that\u2019s the way to look at the market: Apple is competing old Apple \u2014 so the secondary market. And that\u2019s the case in the stocks as well. So the stock market is like the secondary market for equity. [40:43] So it\u2019s people buying and selling old, used stocks. And then there\u2019s the primary market of IPOs. We\u2019ve seen some IPOs recently of businesses raising capital because \u2014 now, okay, so what happens when the government intervenes in these markets? What happens when the government decides that the price of stocks is too low, so we as the government are gonna start buying stocks? Not only that, but they\u2019re also just gonna start printing money to buy stocks. They\u2019re not gonna take the money from any other part of the system. They actually are taking money from a different part of the system: what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re diluting out people who hold USD. People who hold money \u2014 cash, USD, in any form, and including people who hold government treasuries, because government treasuries are actually the same thing as cash at this point, because governments have already said that they\u2019re gonna buy all their treasuries, by creating new dollars. So the Federal Reserve \u2014 and you\u2019ll see Jerome Powell, who\u2019s the current chairman, or Neel Kashkari also has a video of him saying this, where they say, We\u2019ll buy an infinite number of bonds in order to stabilize the economy. We\u2019ll create an infinite amount of cash in order to provide liquidity to the system so that it continues to function. And that\u2019s why interest rates are going to zero, because a 0% interest bond is cash, right? It\u2019s just the same way of saying it\u2019s cash, you\u2019re just giving it a different name, because the whole thing about cash is that it\u2019s 0%. It just sits there. Whereas, a loan \u2014 you earn interest on a loan. If you\u2019re lending the money and taking on risk, there\u2019s no reason why you would ever lend out cash, if you\u2019re taking on risk. But if you\u2019re lending cash to the government, you\u2019re not actually taking on any risk, and they\u2019re making this very clear to everyone, and so thus, it\u2019s 0%. And it\u2019s risk-free, right? They say, Hey, the risk-free interest rate is whatever treasury yields are. So, alright, let\u2019s take \u2019em at their word and that\u2019s 0%. [43:04] Anyway, when the government is spending money, usually it\u2019s deficit spending, I think it\u2019s like 30 \u2014 any additional incremental spending is gonna be deficit spending, right? Nobody\u2019s raising taxes at this point, and they\u2019re also cutting taxes, cutting payroll taxes, deferring taxes, and we can talk about the Coronavirus stuff. But in any case, every time the government is spending, or is buying bonds with the Federal Reserve, they are diluting out USD holders, and they are stealing wealth from people who hold USD. Now, you could say that it\u2019s not really theft, because people who hold US dollars are being given ample forewarning that, like, Hey look, you\u2019re gonna have 2% inflation, you\u2019re gonna get diluted out \u2014 this is their explicit mandate. Which is fair, but when you think about who holds cash the most as a percentage of their balance sheet, it\u2019s actually the people who are living from paycheck to paycheck, because they don\u2019t have the means to hold any other asset, which goes back to our earlier conversation about, well savings technology, that\u2019s all fine and well, but what about people who are living who are living from paycheck to paycheck? Their problem right now, is that they get their first paycheck, and so they\u2019ve got, let\u2019s say, $1000 in the bank. And they\u2019re gonna spend it down over the course of a month, until their next paycheck, and so they\u2019re gonna get another $1000. Living paycheck to paycheck is another way of saying living off of cash. Not having the ability to accumulate capital which would allow you to invest in stocks, which are not getting diluted out, right? In fact, they are where the dilution is going. They are where \u201cMoney printer go BRRR\u201d \u2014 that shows itself in the stocks going up, and that\u2019s why \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: That\u2019s where the inflation is going. It\u2019s a melt-up."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [45:09]: Yeah it\u2019s a melt-up, and that\u2019s why you\u2019ve got Davy Day Trader Portnoy saying stocks are gonna go up! And he\u2019s right! Now the problem is that people who are living paycheck to paycheck, they don\u2019t live from Apple share to Apple share, right? Where, for the month that they\u2019re holding that cash and drawing against it, it\u2019s going up in value because it\u2019s Apple shares, right? No, quite the opposite \u2014 their purchasing power is going down, and so they\u2019re not even treading water. They\u2019re drowning! And the government is drowning them, because the government is making it such that the cash that they\u2019re holding between paycheck periods is constantly losing value relative to both consumer goods that they\u2019re spending money on, but also capital goods and real estate that they\u2019re also spending money on indirectly through rents. So rents are going up, people can\u2019t even get ahead, they\u2019ve gotta get a second job, they\u2019ve gotta get a third job, and the government has turned the working class into an increasing inequality of, Okay, we\u2019re gonna print money to enrich people who have the ability to accumulate assets, who own stocks and real estate \u2014 we\u2019re gonna make them rich, and we\u2019re gonna make everyone else poor. And that\u2019s the government\u2019s explicit policy right now. Same thing with the paycheck protection program. Instead of printing money and giving it to people, we\u2019re gonna print money and give it to the biggest business owners, and then they can give it to the people or not \u2014 we don\u2019t care. So it\u2019s kind of this kleptocracy that\u2019s built up, and it\u2019s not Republican or Democrat, either. Every administration has this same policy, it\u2019s all just about the marketing of Who do they pay lip-service to? Do they press the fear button on the sheep, or do they press the reward of Hey, we\u2019re gonna give you free money, Vote For Me! Or, Hey, be afraid of everyone outside of your community, Vote For Me! So it\u2019s really manipulative.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [47:27]: So when hyperbitcoinization? And I kind of think we\u2019re going through it now, I don\u2019t think we can feel it or see it. But I think we don\u2019t have the market depth to be truly taking off, and I don\u2019t think we can really touch that until $1 trillion, say $50k a Bitcoin, and I\u2019m not really looking to talk about price. But, quickly from $1 trillion to $2 trillion, we gain parity with the US dollar in physical cash, or somewhere close to that, and then I think that things will just accelerate beyond. Where do you see things playing out over the next 5 years in Bitcoin, and that phrase hyperbitcoinization?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: There\u2019s two modes of thought that I\u2019m bi-polar between: (1) One is that the past is an excellent teacher of what the future will look like. And so the next 5 years are gonna look a lot like the past 5 years \u2014 another bull market, another hype mania, another all-time high, another wave of alt coins, and it\u2019s just gonna be another cycle. The (2) other way to think about it is that this is the final cycle. And that fiat is going to collapse and that this is going to be gradually and then suddenly a complete change in the monetary system within the next 5 years, because the government has undermined their own monetary unit. To me, hyperbitcoinization is every bull market, right? Where we go parabolic. To me that\u2019s just like a step in the hyperbitcoinization process. And then we need to take a breather between those.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Do you think that there will be as much a breather at the end of this cycle?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [49:45]: Well the argument for why there\u2019s a breather is because there\u2019s so much Bitcoin being created by miners and being dumped onto the market. So if the last halving has made it such that there\u2019s not really room for a breather because there\u2019s not that supply effect, of supply increasing, then this cycle is going to be fundamentally different \u2014 the price is gonna be $200,000 \u2014 you\u2019re gonna have people who are gonna be like, Alright, time to take gains \u2014 time to sell here! But what if it only goes down 10% to $180,000? And then there\u2019s just more people buying? And then it goes up to like $400,000?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: They lose Bitcoin \u2014 they lose their position."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [50:41]: Right. And so it\u2019s like, by what metric are we trying to decide where the all-time high is gonna be, and why would I stop and take gains at any point? Because suddenly the expectation becomes, Hey look! The dollar is not long for this world \u2014 why would I want to hold dollar-denominated assets? Maybe I would want to rotate into some equities? Maybe I think stocks are cheap relative to Bitcoin, and I do a little bit of re-balancing at the margin, and maybe that\u2019s the angle? Or, there are companies generating Bitcoin cash flows, and who are using Bitcoin as their treasury reserve asset, and so now I\u2019m starting to think, Alright, well, it\u2019s not really selling Bitcoin if I buy some equity that generates Bitcoin cash flow. I gotta calculate relative yield, and then I\u2019ve gotta do the Warren Buffett value-investing analysis of, Is this security fundamentally undervalued? Today, you\u2019d have to be a complete idiot to be a value investor. Why would you wanna think that fundamental value matters at all? The Federal Reserve is bidding up everything. There\u2019s no such thing as fundamental value anymore. All you\u2019re doing is playing a game of greater fool, of, Hey look! Stocks only go up! You don\u2019t need to look at P/E ratios. That\u2019s old school. But I think that with Bitcoin, it\u2019s gonna make that popular again, because now it\u2019s no longer like, Okay, I need to dump my inflationary cash that\u2019s getting diluted straight into the stock market, otherwise I\u2019m gonna lose purchasing power, right? And that the stock market has become a store of value, and people use the stock market for savings, and they\u2019re like, Well, I gotta put my money somewhere \u2014 I gotta put my money to work. And with Bitcoin it\u2019s like, No! I can actually just hold cash, and I can be like a poker player. I can wait for the next hand. It\u2019s not like the blinds are increasing, right? With Bitcoin, the blinds are negative. Your Bitcoin purchasing power is gonna be increasing long term, because it is a fixed amount, because it is scarce, and the supply of stocks and the supply of consumer goods is gonna increase, so your purchasing power is gonna increase, and so you can wait until you get investment opportunities that are really interesting to you. And so in the real estate world, they talk about location, location, location. Alright, well, that doesn\u2019t apply when you\u2019re under a fiat system. Under a fiat system you\u2019ve gotta put your money to work as quickly as possible, so you\u2019ve gotta buy whatever real estate properties are on the market whenever you\u2019re looking, right? You can\u2019t just sit on a bunch of cash and wait for a decade until somebody buys a piece of land that you\u2019ve got your eye on. You\u2019ve gotta be working some angle in that 10 years. With Bitcoin you can actually just sit on Bitcoin for 10 years, and when it\u2019s up for grabs, you pounce on it and you pay whatever price.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [53:48]: That\u2019s great. I really see what you\u2019re saying there. Before we let you go, because we\u2019ve been monopolizing your time, I\u2019d like to talk a little bit about your website. You seem to have impeccable timing as usual, you just launched pierrerochard.com. I read the articles, I have to admit some of them were a little above my head, specifically the auditing the Bitcoin supply. I didn\u2019t know there was a 2,310,000 satoshi difference from the 21 million. I go around telling people about the 21 million. I didn\u2019t really follow what you were saying about the unspendables if you could talk a bit about that. As well as talking a little bit about, miners can mistakenly issue less than a full block reward, probably due to their proprietary software. Maybe talk about that article, and then we\u2019ll get into the Bitcoin development one as well."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [54:31]: Yeah, for sure. So I still have time here. I think that I did not address the personal finance question of accumulating Bitcoin, because to me, Bitcoin is a savings technology. Part of it is, Yes, you can use it for long term savings as I was describing, but also that it incentivizes long term savings. So, just as a new technology might incentivize behavior that is kind of underutilized today\u2014of putting money aside for a rainy day \u2014 people, I think, have been incentivized to live a life of consumerism. Have you ever watched the TV show \u201cMarie Kondo\u201d?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yes! I\u2019ve read it and Marie Kondo\u2019d the house for a bit."}

There\u2019s people living paycheck to paycheck who have a thousand nutcrackers in their garage, because they\u2019re hoarding nutcrackers.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: And they were cheap and they were easy to buy."}

And that\u2019s really where I try to go with, Bitcoin is a savings technology\u2014$10 a week and before you know it you\u2019ve got $1000 of Bitcoin, $1000 in satoshis and not nutcrackers."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [56:48]: Yeah. When the government doesn\u2019t let people hoard money, then their hoarding gets directed in other places.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: But those hoarders feel good, and their assets go up, and no one sees the slow drift."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: In the worst case scenario, you\u2019ve got the TV show Hoarders. These people have real psychological problems. But even completely normal, middle-class people, you go into their house and you\u2019re like, Uh, you\u2019re bordering on hoarding here \u2014 you\u2019ve got a lot of useless stuff laying around. So that\u2019s where I think Bitcoin is savings technology, and then it leads to funny memes on Twitter, and I\u2019m like, Get rid of your chairs! It\u2019s the same concept of, I look around my house and I\u2019m like, Why do I have 30 chairs in my house? And you\u2019re shopping on Amazon, and it\u2019s like, Okay, well, $60 for a chair, okay!\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [57:54]: Do you think Bitcoin got you to think that way, to look around and say, Oh, how can I get more Bitcoin?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Well, my Amazon account is connected to my credit card, and it all just happens in the background and I don\u2019t really consciously think about it. And when I look at that price of dollars, I think that, if I got a browser plug-in, that translated everything into satoshis, that I would immediately be like, Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I can\u2019t afford this! This is too expensive! Because I\u2019ll be doing online shopping and I\u2019m like, Okay I wanna get this electronic thing. Oh \u2014 that\u2019s $5,000? I can\u2019t afford that. So psychologically, I think that people talk about the unit bias \u2014 there\u2019s also the inflationary bias of, Well, I should just spend my money because it\u2019s just gonna be worthless. And Keynesians wanna incentivize this, right? They say, We want inflation so that we push people into consuming. So that they don\u2019t hoard money. To force the money to circulate and to stimulate the economy. And I call this the high-velocity trash economy.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [59:07]: I got it from The Bitcoin Standard, reading a little bit about Keynes and how he was just living it up day to day, and no real regard for the future.

And in college, or in a lot of finance, accounting, and economics classes at least here in the states, you don\u2019t hear about Austrian economics. Keynes is just put on a pedestal and it\u2019s just the way things are, and it\u2019s great! And it\u2019s working for everybody."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: And I feel like what Marie Kondo shows is that, if we have fewer things that are of higher quality, then we\u2019re happier. And I think that\u2019s just fundamentally true. Okay, I don\u2019t think that the government should incentivize that, but I don\u2019t think they should disincentivize it, either.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Yeah. Well money\u2019s a language, and it teaches to spend our money, at least. It\u2019s built into the code of the money."}

As well as these unspendables, and you know, the miners can issue less than full block rewards, which, I\u2019m assuming leads to the shortage of Bitcoin that we\u2019re talking about."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yes. So you start at zero with the Bitcoin ledger. And then you\u2019ve got the genesis block, so that\u2019s 50 Bitcoin. Guess what? The Bitcoin code won\u2019t actually let anyone spend those 50 Bitcoin, so we\u2019ve already eliminated 50 Bitcoin from the total spendable supply of Bitcoin. Why is that the case? Because the genesis block is actually hard-coded into Bitcoin. Why is that the case? Because you need a way to bootstrap the truth machine, right? What are you gonna has as the previous valid block if you don\u2019t have a first block? So it\u2019s kind of this chick and egg problem. And Satoshi just solved it by hard-coding it and then saying, Hey look, to be fair\u2014no pre-mine, nobody can spend this, it\u2019s just going to be hard-coded in there. Unlike other blockchains, where they\u2019ll hard-code in a beginning amount, but it goes to them, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: I mean, that whole notion is incredibly forward-looking. Satoshi is never collecting or using or spending these coins, which is incredibly democratic or fair in a lot of ways. And at this point, I don\u2019t know if Satoshi knows that alt coins are inevitable\u2014probably does, but it just seems incredibly patient and it\u2019s an incredible feat, I think. And kind of giving an incredible legend to the story."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [01:02:57]: Yeah, and I feel like we don\u2019t give him enough credit for his ethics. And if we contrast it with what has gone on since Satoshi, Satoshi was an incredibly ethical founder, as far as cryptocurrency systems go. And he made this 50 Bitcoin provably unspendable, and then everything after that he mined it, he used the Bitcoin algorithm, the SHA-256 squared like anyone else would. The next 50 Bitcoin that were actually mined by Satoshi \u2014 he mined at a loss, because they were worth nothing at the time. And he consumed electricity to produce them. So Bitcoin were created at a loss from the beginning. And so anyone who says, Oh, well Satoshi got this unfair amount, it\u2019s like \u2014 Dude, he got nothing, he got zero dollars, or he got zero amount of value, however you want to put it. He didn\u2019t get any value for free, he actually lost value when he was mining Bitcoin. But you know what? He believed in the project. And so that\u2019s why he mined it, and he made is open source and he released it to the public and he immediately got as many people mining as he could. And ultimately, he couldn\u2019t force other people to adopt Bitcoin. What he could do was explain Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition as he saw it, provide the source code, provide his thought process behind it, and then just hope that people join in and start mining. Anyway, back to the auditing: the way that that 50 Bitcoin is calculated of, Alright, every 10 minutes we\u2019re gonna create new Bitcoin, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re gonna distribute it, and it\u2019s gonna go to the miner, who provides the proof-of-work. I\u2019ll skip over proof-of-work, because if we talk about Bitcoin mining, it\u2019s gonna take the rest of the afternoon.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: But if you could touch on maybe the difficulty adjustment, because I think it\u2019s fascinating, it\u2019s part of what makes the whole process perfect."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Let\u2019s say the value of Bitcoin is going up, but the number of Bitcoin being created stays the same, of 50 Bitcoin every 10 minutes, then that\u2019s gonna attract more miners, because now the revenue that the miners are getting has increased, so now there\u2019s just gonna be more competition to get a slice of that revenue. Because, more cost can be applied rationally \u2014 we can create more mining hardware, we can actually even use electricity that\u2019s more expensive per kilowatt-hour, and that actually causes blocks to get produced more quickly, and so then, you have a block coming out every 9 minutes, instead of every 10 minutes, which is what we were expecting. And then every 8 minutes. Okay, so what\u2019s the problem here? Well, if that had been the case for Satoshi, he could have instantly mined all 21 million Bitcoin on Day Zero. Because there\u2019s nothing fixing the clock. What Satoshi added\u2014which was genius \u2014 was that every two weeks divided by 10 minutes, every X blocks \u2014\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [01:06:20]: When you say added, do you mean in the source code, or after the fact?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Oh, in the source code, before he released it, yeah. It\u2019s amazing \u2014 I wonder how much testing he did on his own test-net, to figure out, tuning the parameters. Versus, just him blinding being like, I don\u2019t know, this might work? And then just throwing it out there.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: There\u2019s just too much perfection in it to be blind."}

{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [01:06:55]: I don\u2019t think that it ever will be finished, fixed \u2014 fixed, too. There\u2019s bugs in layer one that will never get fixed. Or bugs in layer one that I don\u2019t think today will ever get fixed but someone in the future will find a way to fix them.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: What do you think is the odds on a catastrophic bug in the system? Obviously we could move to a new \u2014 you could move the UTXO set and do different things, but that would cause quite a ruckus I would think, and cause quite a nose-dive. What do you think the chances of that are?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah, so the worst kind of bug would be if somebody finds a way to create more Bitcoin, and those Bitcoins circulate before we realize what\u2019s going on.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: But what do you think are the odds of something like that? I don\u2019t want to put you on the spot."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Well, I don\u2019t want to pat myself on the back, because there\u2019s no way to know how this will go going forward, but the auditing that I\u2019ve put together helps reduce the risk, because \u2014 and I\u2019m working on creating a real-time thing, where it tweets out, every block, Okay, everything\u2019s hunky-dory, and we would have a real-time alarm of, Hey, there\u2019s more Bitcoin than we expect. And that this would presumably allow us to roll things back or fix them before an extensive amount of damage is done. Now there are other ways of doing this. So one other way of doing this is having different Bitcoin implementations. So the idea being that the inflation bug hopefully is not the same inflation bug in every implementation, and one of the implementations actually does things correctly. But it could conceivably be the case that the same inflation bug shows up in two different implementations. But, at this point I think that\u2019s very, very, very, very low risk. Which is way I\u2019m so confident. To me, it\u2019s lower risk than the risk of a gold asteroid being brought into low-earth orbit and exploited and causing the gold price to crash.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Right on. That\u2019s great. That builds a lot of confidence as well. It\u2019s the most powerful computer in the world, most secure network."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Yeah there\u2019s different ways of looking at it. From a mining perspective, it is the most powerful supercomputer, right? But is it really a computer? Because it doesn\u2019t have the flexibility that we would expect from a computer. So you can\u2019t use the Bitcoin network for a gene analysis, DNA analysis, which is what you would use a supercomputer for. You can\u2019t use it for modeling climate change. That\u2019s what you would use a supercomputer for. And then, in terms of it being resistant to attack from others, there\u2019s the mining part, but there\u2019s also the decentralized network of Bitcoin nodes. And so, to the extent that Bitcoin\u2019s blockchain is replicated, and it\u2019s consensus rules are being verified by a lot of different people, not just miners, then it is more secure than it otherwise would be.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Talking about nodes. So let\u2019s say you\u2019re running your node, you have your wallet connected to your node, you receive your satoshis.

How engaged with the node are you when you\u2019re not using your coins?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: One of the theoretical guarantees and, in practice, has been a guarantee so far, is that you can use your node to verify that you have received Bitcoin, and then you can go offline. And you can go offline until you\u2019re wanting to receive more Bitcoin and verify that you\u2019re receiving Bitcoin, or that you want to spend your Bitcoin, and that you want to verify that you\u2019re actually able to do that.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: So when I go on to Clark Moody dashboard and I think it says something like 10,000 nodes on the network, those nodes are being turned on and off and it\u2019s 10,000 at any given moment, but there might be more nodes that exist."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Right, so some nodes might be permanently online because that\u2019s how they were configured. Others, it\u2019s like, Okay, well, when my laptop is closed, it\u2019s not in sync with the network. When I opened it back up, it catches back up.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: What do you say to someone\u2014a pre-coiner and they\u2019re like, I just bought Bitcoin.

Or are you gonna skip over that with someone who\u2019s kind of new to it?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Well I would ask them first of all, why did they buy Bitcoin? What are they trying to achieve? What was the problem they were trying to solve when they bought Bitcoin? If the probably they were trying to solve is that they just want to have dollar gains \u2014 they think Bitcoin\u2019s gonna go up in the next few months, then they should just leave it on Coinbase.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: Or they just want savings technology."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard [01:12:36]: Well, so let\u2019s say they want longterm savings, right? They want to hold Bitcoin for like 10 years. Then I would say, Well, okay, how do you feel about leaving your coins on Coinbase for 10 years?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: But for a lot of people they feel very comfortable leaving their coins on bankofamerica.com."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Then good, then they should leave it on Coinbase. If they\u2019re like, well, I feel comfortable about that. And then I ask them, What do you think about holding your own keys? And they\u2019re like, Well, I\u2019d be really uncomfortable doing that. Alright, well that\u2019s kind of the end of the conversation. You\u2019re done. If they\u2019re like, I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t trust Coinbase, what are my options? Alright, well then we can have that conversation, because we\u2019ve got lots of options.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: So when you\u2019re talking to someone like this, maybe they come up to you and they say, I\u2019m not really familiar with Bitcoin, but I\u2019m hearing a lot about it and I really want to dig in. Where do you turn them to? Is there a particular article or one podcast or one video?"}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: I think that understanding Bitcoin\u2019s value proposition gets people excited and so there\u2019s Vijay Boyapati\u2019s piece, kind of showing what are Bitcoin\u2019s advantages over gold.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman: But I can\u2019t get that many people to dig into it. I mean it\u2019s a 45-minute article, a lot of people, they\u2019ll skim the headlines, it just doesn\u2019t bring them in."}
{"prompt": "Pierre Rochard: Then I just tell people, Yeah, go on CashApp and buy some. I know that its value is gonna go up, and then they\u2019re gonna want to buy more. And then they\u2019re gonna buy more, and then they\u2019re gonna want to understand it. At some point \u2014 or not! That\u2019s fine too. They might get stuck somewhere, but, the idea being that, I did not understand Bitcoin until long after I had held some for a while. I didn\u2019t dig into, Okay, how does the UTXO set work, how do Bitcoin inputs and outputs work? I just knew addresses and wallets, for a very long time. And that\u2019s fine! There\u2019s no reason to really dig into it, unless you\u2019re like, Okay, this system, not only is it valuable to me because I have Bitcoin, but it\u2019s also valuable to me because I think that it\u2019s the future. And that the sooner I learn this, the sooner I can start benefitting from it and living in the future. So it\u2019s like, Okay, the Internet has just come out, and let\u2019s say you\u2019re a software developer. Do you want to learn web development now, or do you want to wait? Frankly, I would argue that, if I look back on when I first heard about software development, it was MySQL. MySQL was the database. And so, I could\u2019ve learned SQL back then, but I was reading WIRED magazine and I was like, Oh, software development is gonna be obsolete because it\u2019s all gonna get outsourced to India. And so I was like, Okay, I don\u2019t need to learn SQL. Fast-forward 20 years, literally 20 years, everyone\u2019s still using SQL. If I had learned SQL that would\u2019ve been an excellent job skill to have from the Day Zero of having a job! It\u2019s a great skill to have! So I think that there\u2019s technologies that are Lindy, that are going to be around for a long time, that are going to be hugely valuable and powerful, and you might as well just learn them now, because you\u2019re gonna have to learn them at some point, and the longer you put it off, the less you\u2019re gonna benefit from it over your lifetime.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Cedric Youngelman [01:16:27]: What do you think you\u2019d be doing if Bitcoin didn\u2019t exist?"}

I get in front of my phone or my computer screen to do stuff that I thought about when I was working with my hands, and working with my legs. Using my spatial awareness. Because I think that a lot of the problems people have, especially with Coronavirus now, it\u2019s that they\u2019re locked indoors. They\u2019re sheltering in place. I\u2019m like, No! Get out! Get some Vitamin D, it\u2019s good for you! Because otherwise, you become, like, a yield farmer.

In today\u2019s special seminar we have a very special guest, Mr. Michael Saylor, the CEO of Microstrategy, a publicly traded company that has just announced the purchase of more than $400 million worth of Bitcoin, to use as their primary treasury asset. Mr. Saylor has very gracefully and thankfully accepted my invitation to come and join us in this seminar so we can discuss his company\u2019s move and how it relates to Bitcoin and The Bitcoin Standard, seeing that he publicly said this was an attempt to put his company on a Bitcoin standard. So I think we\u2019ll hopefully find a lot to discuss, and a lot of common ground. Thank you so much Michael for joining."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Thanks a lot. So, from a selfish perspective, and from the perspective of many other people in this seminar, I guess we could probably begin by asking you: we know that you\u2019ve read The Bitcoin Standard, but what did you think? What were your impressions?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Well, I will say that I read the book, it blew my mind, and I thought that you put together all of the technical and economic, motivational, and related issues better than anything that I\u2019ve seen. I guess the best compliment I can give you is I read your book and I invested $425 million in Bitcoin. But actually, you know there\u2019s some people that read about Bitcoin and they decide they\u2019re gonna buy some, and there\u2019s some people that read about it, you know, first it\u2019s a speculation\u2014I\u2019m gonna buy some, and then some people read and think, I\u2019m gonna buy a lot, and some people read about Bitcoin and they think it\u2019s cool technology, and they wanna get on the train. I think that The Bitcoin Standard is amazing, because it got me over those hurdles to realize that it\u2019s not really about buying a lot, it\u2019s actually about inverting the balance sheet of the company. What we were doing was that we were inverting the balance sheet such that we\u2019re floating on a Bitcoin sail, on a crypto sail if you will, and as the liquidity and the monetary system gets pumped up, we want it to float, rather than sink, on that pool of liquidity. And I think that lots of other people in the Bitcoin industry have written a lot of stuff that is very interesting, but I thought that your book put it all together in a very compelling way. And so, it was probably the most impactful of all the stuff I\u2019d looked at on our way of thinking.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Well thank you very much."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: It shattered my illusions about money. At the point in the book where you say that in the last decade, the monetary system has been expanding by 7% a year: I think we\u2019ve been conditioned to think, well, 2% inflation \u2014 therefore 2% monetary expansion, and it never registered with me that even in normal times, you were getting 7% monetary expansion, or 8%, and then once I saw that, it all clicked for me, and I realized that a lot of the problem that we had was we were sitting on too much cash, and if you have $500 million in cash, and you make $500 million in operating income every year, then you have $35 million in after-tax cash-flow, which is equal to 7% of your cash balance, which meant that our asset purchasing power was deteriorating as fast as we were generating income, and we weren\u2019t gonna get ahead, no matter how hard we worked, and it was a big epiphany. And that was before 2020. Obviously, after 2020, things changed.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [04:40]: Yeah. I was really intrigued by your discussion with Stephan Livera in his podcast on inflation. It\u2019s a drum that I\u2019ve beaten for many, many years. But I thought your idea of saying that inflation, that there are three types of goods within an economy: (1) the goods that drop in price every year \u2014 technology, and goods that require heavy or high initial costs, initial fixed costs, and then low marginal costs \u2014 these tend to decline in price, and then you have (2) the goods that rise at a small rate\u2014labor and land, basically undifferentiated labor and land if you want, not the most skilled labor and not the most desirable land and property \u2014 these things appreciate at around 1%, 2%, 3% every year, and then there\u2019s (3) the desirable, truly scarce things that people compete for, and these are the things where the inflation is 6%, 7%, 8% and maybe even up to 20% a year. And I think that was really an eye-opening way of thinking about it and I had not thought about it before. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve written something about this somewhere, or if you\u2019ve come across it somewhere, because I think it\u2019s a very useful framework that I intend to use in my next book, so where do I cite that?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [19:36]: Well, first I\u2019m gonna call a board meeting. Because the next thing I\u2019m gonna do is get the board to adopt the fact that, No, we didn\u2019t just agree to buy $250 million worth of Bitcoin, we\u2019re gonna actually implement a treasury policy. The big idea, the Bitcoin Standard, for a corporation\u2014and I think we could be a model \u2014 is: we do business in 25 countries. In Yen in Japan, we have working capital in Japan in Yen, in Won in Korea, in Euros in Europe, in Pesos in Argentina, in Real in Brazil, in Dollars in the US. We were on a Dollar Standard, we had a bunch of USD sitting all around in USD accounts. Our working capital was $50 million a year \u2014 maybe I can convince my CFO we\u2019ll need less, we\u2019ll see, but we have about $50 million in working capital in our operating accounts, we had $700 million worth of other stuff, we started buying our stock back, and then we started thinking about the Bitcoin standard, and the conclusion is: You sell products and services in fiat, you hold operating accounts in the local fiat accounts \u2014 that\u2019s your working capital, you sweep your excess working capital into your treasury, you convert your treasury into Gold, if you\u2019re on the Gold Standard, or Bitcoin, if you\u2019re on the Bitcoin Standard. In the future, should you ever need to purchase property, purchase products or purchase services in excess of your operating accounts, you convert your treasury back into fiat, in the currency you need. If you\u2019re generating cash positive, if you\u2019re making $50 million a year, you just keep sweeping $50 million a year into your treasury. Then you have a choice: Do you buy your own stock, or do you buy Bitcoin? Well, our treasury policy is: We do one or the other subject to market conditions. The outside investors would say, Why don\u2019t you just give us the $500 million back? Well, if I give you the $500 million back I de-capitalize the company, it\u2019s like you giving all your life savings to your favorite charity. Well you\u2019ll feel good for a while, but if you lose your job, your children will starve. And if you care about your children, if you care about your customers, your employees, your counter-parties, your integrity \u2014 I signed a 10-year lease, I\u2019ve never missed a payment in my life. I\u2019ve been CEO for 31 years. I never missed a payroll, I\u2019ve never missed a payment. I look at a customer in the eye, I swear to them, I will maintain the software. That\u2019s a matter of integrity. I do business with governments, banks. Everybody under the sun. They have to trust me. I have to be able to make good on my promises. I can\u2019t de-capitalize the company. So yeah, I\u2019ll buy the stock back from time to time, if it\u2019s mispriced. If someone wants to short my stock, have at it. As long as you have a strong treasury, you\u2019re not afraid of a short seller. What do you do, drive my stock to $20 a share? I buy it all, go private, thank you. Do that.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Absolutely, this was one of the questions that I wanted to ask you: How alien is this concept of keeping a cash balance in business these days? How much of a pariah have you become by telling people that keeping cash balances is important?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: \u2014 was like, if you know the future, why write the book? Buy the thing, and then Tweet about it. You know, I have a lot of opinions, but like, by the way, my hat\u2019s off to you: it\u2019s pretty obvious in hindsight to figure this stuff out now. In 2020, I look at it and I\u2019m like, well okay this makes sense. You wrote what you wrote 2 years, you must have been thinking about it 3 years ago, right?\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Yeah, I wrote it 3 years ago, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it honestly since before Bitcoin came around. Bitcoin was the solution to a problem that I\u2019d thought about before that."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: So writing the book\u2019s good, but, invest in the thing.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: It\u2019s very fascinating what you\u2019ve been thinking about, and I have so many questions I want to follow up on. With regards to holding cash on the balance sheet, I\u2019m wondering, do you have plans for moving into using Bitcoin in your day-to-day transactions as in making payroll in Bitcoin, accepting Bitcoin as payment and so on?"}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [28:03]: Here\u2019s my thinking on this, and I Tweeted about it today: I mean, all the Bitcoin Cash guys, they\u2019re fanatic about It\u2019s gotta be a medium of exchange. Roger Ver has been Tweeting at me, It\u2019s gotta be a medium of exchange. My view is, there\u2019s a $250 trillion ocean of assets: stocks, bonds, precious metals, real estate, derivatives \u2014 no one\u2019s buying a pizza with any of that stuff. No one ever took a share of Apple stock and walked into Starbucks and complained and bitched and moaned about not being able to use Apple stock in order to pay for their Starbucks. You have a house? Try using your house to pay for pizza! What do you think is the transaction velocity on a house? Put it on the market, wait 6 months, get a buyer. \u201cI wanna buy your house.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s 30 days.\u201d It takes 30 days and the transaction fee is 6%. You wanna sell a million dollar house? It\u2019s $60,000 in 30 days from the point that someone swears they wanna buy it. So somebody\u2019s running around in there saying, Well we gotta drive the transaction cost down. We gotta drive the transaction speed up. You need to be able to move the asset from point to point, peer to peer, as a settlement network. You need that. You need that for freedom. It\u2019s like I say to you: Saifedean, you can go anywhere in the world, you\u2019re free. That doesn\u2019t mean you should go to a different place every day. Now, having the freedom is not the same as using the freedom. Just because you can do a thing, doesn\u2019t mean you should do a thing\u2014Stoic philosophy, Marcus Aurelius, 2,000 years ago, or whoever else did it. So, I look at this and I think, it\u2019s nice, but you should sell your products and services in fiat, and you should sell your property in fiat. You should buy your property, your products and services in fiat, and the Yen, the Won, the Euro, the whatever, because that\u2019s the way that 99.99% of the people do it. You should sweep the excess monetary energy into your treasury, and you should convert it to Bitcoin. So, just one last point on this, and you\u2019ll get it: the Parable of the Lions. A bunch of lions are chasing after a bunch of antelope. There are some lazy lions, they can\u2019t catch the antelope. They complain to the zookeeper on the game reserve, \u201cThe antelope are running around too fast. It\u2019s too hard for us, we can\u2019t catch them. Slow them down.\u201d The zookeeper solves the problem by hobbling the antelope. The lazy lions catch the antelope. The lions eat the antelopes. The antelopes all die. Then the lions all die. The zookeeper blames it on the weather, and gets another job. That\u2019s the story of transaction fees and transaction rates on a crypto network. That\u2019s why the Ethereum, the Bitcoin Cash, all the other forks. You know this, you\u2019re the one who told me: it\u2019s a billion times more expensive to do it on a proof of work network, or a trillion times? When it gets to be a billion times more expensive, that\u2019s enough, right? It\u2019s a billion times more expensive to do transactions on the network. The reason that you want crypto is you want sovereign immortality. I want to put $100 million on the network, and I want it to last for 100 years, and on the other end I want it to come out $100 million, even though half the governments failed, and everybody debased and destroyed everything. I want to put it in and I want it to transcend time and domain, time and space. By the way, that\u2019s a pretty good application for putting $250 trillion worth of stuff. But it doesn\u2019t have to move fast. I do think there are some interesting things that our business will look at in Bitcoin: we\u2019re standing up a full node, and we\u2019re looking at the data coming off of Bitcoin, and we\u2019re looking to see if we can\u2019t thread the data sets and information from Bitcoin into our intelligence offerings, in order to provide that. But I don\u2019t feel the need to buy anything in Bitcoin or sell anything in Bitcoin, and it\u2019s a billion times less efficient to do it that way. So, why do people get wrapped around the axle with the medium of exchange, they\u2019re trying so hard. Only 1%, you know a typical rich person, a wealthy person, spends 2% of the wealth every year. 98% of their wealth just sits there. The richest man in the world, I guess it\u2019s Jeff Bezos, is rich because of a bunch of assets including Amazon stock, that\u2019s hardly moving ever. And by the way, if you have any wealth, the thing that doesn\u2019t get said is, it\u2019s so tax inefficient to sell it, and guys in New York realize this \u2014 there are families in New York City, they own a city block, they\u2019ve owned it for a hundred years, they have real estate on it. They never sell it. You just refinance it every year, they\u2019ve never made any money, Saifedean. I have $100 million worth of an asset: it\u2019s going up 7% a year because the asset inflation rate on real estate in Manhattan is going up, probably more than 7% a year, right? Every 10 years I refinance it, I borrow some more money, it\u2019s tax free, I live off of tax-free debt, a hundred years later, the family\u2019s got $1 billion worth of real estate, $700 million worth of debt, they\u2019re paying 0% interest on the debt, they\u2019ve never made any income their entire life. Why would you ever generate operating income that\u2019s taxable? Everybody\u2019s just gonna borrow against their assets as their assets inflate. You know, I can borrow money from a bank, at LIBOR, I can borrow money for a yacht at LIBOR plus 200 basis points, Saifedean. And LIBOR is like, what? What\u2019s LIBOR? I can borrow money against a liquid asset like a stock, at LIBOR plus 50 basis points. Why would you ever sell anything? And so this idea of moving around Bitcoin, it\u2019s like taking the billion-times-harder way around the field. I gotta run around the field a billion times to score one run.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [35:46]: Yeah, and I entirely agree, obviously. The way that I was thinking about it was, if you were going to be using it, you won\u2019t be using it on-chain. As I think you Tweeted about it a few days ago, what was it, 99.8% of Bitcoin transactions would happen off-chain. This is something that people miss when they talk about scaling, because whatever asset you\u2019re talking about whether it\u2019s another digital currency or a physical gold or a government money, you\u2019re not gonna perform final settlement with every cup of coffee. It\u2019s just not gonna happen. The final settlement is gonna come at a much slower rate than the transactions, and the day-to-day transactions are going to happen between people who are within networks that you have repeated business with one another so that if your credit card bounces at the coffee shop they\u2019ll know you the next day and they\u2019ll tell you Hey get a new credit card or stop doing this. Their bank will contact your bank or their credit card company will take away your credit card. There are these mechanisms for the smaller payments, and that\u2019s how Bitcoin scales. People misconstrue the Bitcoin network as a payments network and they compare it against VISA or Mastercard on top of Bitcoin and Bitcoin will be the final settlement asset, but it will be much better and faster final settlement than you would get with national currencies."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I think that it\u2019s 100,000 to 1. You know, let\u2019s take Jeff Bezos again: doesn\u2019t he have like $200 billion worth of Amazon stock? He\u2019s got $200 billion, and that\u2019s worth all that Bitcoin is\u2014the entire Bitcoin network is $200 billion. How many transactions do you think Jeff Bezos has done to sell his Amazon stock in his life? I\u2019d be willing to bet you, he picks up the phone once a quarter\u2014about ten times. He\u2019s probably picked up the phone about ten times, and he said to one guy, Uh, well why don\u2019t you sell a million shares of Amazon for me? Click. And he put the phone down. Maybe he did a hundred transactions, okay? He\u2019s just fine. That\u2019s the way it works. You\u2019re gonna sweep your excess capital into a working capital account, and it\u2019s gonna be on Square or PayPal or ApplePay, or in some random bank. By the way, I don\u2019t trust my bank in Argentina for a hundred years. I mean, I had it fail ten years ago. I lost $1 million in Argentina. One day it was in dollars in Bank of America. The next day by edict it was in Pesos at 1:1 in Bank of America. The next day it was devalued to 10:1 in the same bank, and I got back $100,000 and I started with $1 million, and it was gone. The only two places in the world I ever lost money in a bank was Brazil and Argentina. You don\u2019t forget those things. Having said that, I do business with banks in Brazil and Argentina today. I don\u2019t trust them for a hundred years \u2014 you gotta trust them for a hundred days. And so, you just put the amount of money into the banks that you can afford to lose.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Yeah, that\u2019s very powerful."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [39:01]: A million times faster! So it\u2019s like, how about take 1% of your money, and put it into an exchange like Binance. Watch Binance: the thing is incredible. Put it into a centralized exchange, or put it into a centralized mobile wallet, it\u2019s gonna run a million times faster than the best idea on any crypto network, you\u2019re gonna trust it.

{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Okay, I am learning. And life is too short, Saifedean, to try to convince a fanatic to change their mind. The world\u2019s got 7 billion people in it, and if you go on my Twitter and you\u2019re rude, or uncivil, or a jerk, block, block, block. I\u2019m not gonna \u2014 I\u2019ll take one second, but you don\u2019t get to hang out. But to your point, you said, electronic cash in a classical format, so that I\u2019m making cash delivery in settlement, this is back to the Stoic issue: you need the ability to have peer to peer payments in order to have freedom and sovereignty. You need the ability. Just because I have the ability to move $1 or $1 million or $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, I have the ability to send it to anybody anytime, and it\u2019s gonna cost me a few bucks, and 30 minutes. Just because you can do a thing, doesn\u2019t mean you should do a thing. The fact that you have the ability to do it 1 out of 100,000 times, means that it\u2019s a harder form of currency, and a better money than anything else. There\u2019s a phrase: a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of small minds. People get wrapped around the axle of doing a literal interpretation. They\u2019re like, Well that\u2019s not what Satoshi said. Here\u2019s where Nicholas Taleb has a good insight here: A semantic representation of a sophisticated idea may not be adequate. If you come into my restaurant and you ask me what\u2019s on the menu and I say \u201cCold, dead fish,\u201d you might be horrified by that. If I said it to you in Japanese you wouldn\u2019t even know without translating it. If I wrote a book on it, you might understand it better. If I just put it in front of your face, you might think it\u2019s pretty good sushi. Just because the words don\u2019t resonate doesn\u2019t mean the thing isn\u2019t a good thing. So, it\u2019s a 9-page whitepaper, and if you interpret it through a certain lens, you understand \u2014 by the way, it doesn\u2019t even matter if he understood what he was saying or not. It\u2019s putting a lot of weight on one dude or a group of guys 10 years ago to extrapolate how the world was going to evolve later. So I think they had a vision, and the vision works well as a settlement network, and for people who are clinging to an orthodox interpretation of that vision 10 years later, they choose to imbue those semantic representation with their ideology, and it\u2019s crippling to the future of Bitcoin because they wanna do something \u2014 I want to make one more point: if I move $1 from point A to point B, versus $1 billion from point A to point B, isn\u2019t it obvious on its surface that the value in use of moving $1 is a billion times less than the value of moving $1 billion? So they\u2019re chasing the long tail down to something which is exponentially less valuable, and they\u2019re making it a priority on a network, and that\u2019s long-tail foolishness.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [44:36]: Yeah and absolutely, Nakamoto doesn\u2019t have an ownership over Bitcoin, he can\u2019t force people to use it in a certain way and I think the history of science and technology is full of all of these inventions that ended up used in ways where the original inventor didn\u2019t forsee. The Wright brothers, after inventing the airplane, they said, one of them, I can\u2019t remember which, he said, It\u2019s impossible that an airplane will ever cross the Atlantic. And so, what, do we ban flights across the Atlantic because the Wright brothers said it can\u2019t happen? Viagra was meant to be a heart drug. Do we ban it now for other uses because the original vision of the founder was \u201cthis\u201d? You know, technology finds its way based on what people want and not on what inventors say and think, and I think that\u2019s completely midguided. One question I wanted to ask you is a topic that I will focus on in my next book The Fiat Standard. In that book I\u2019m trying to do to fiat money what I did to Bitcoin. When I wrote the Bitcoin Standard the idea was, How do I get this to an intelligent reader with no background? How do I explain to them how this Bitcoin thing works and why it matters? And do it for someone who has zero background as to how this monster works? And I think that kind of framework would be more useful to apply to fiat money because fiat money is a hundred times more complicated than Bitcoin, and I think a lot of people could benefit from trying to understand that. And so, as I started to think about fiat money as an engineer, trying to explain how it functions in the same way that I did with Bitcoin, one mechanism of understanding how it works is that, under a gold standard, if you find a way of making more gold in the world, you\u2019re going to take advantage of it, you\u2019re going to start digging up the gold and selling it because that costs you less than what the price of gold is on the market. Similarly on a Bitcoin standard people are trying to mine more Bitcoin. But on a fiat standard, everybody is trying to mine fiat, and the way that it works on a fiat standard is, you mine fiat by issuing debt, so you can mine it by printing pieces of paper, but that\u2019s really the old fiat standard. Today, the vast majority of money is not pieces of paper, it\u2019s debt that\u2019s issued by banks. Everytime a new financial institution makes a new loan, new fiat money is created."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: Saifedean, can I just stop you right there? I think the metaphor of a bank as a fiat miner is the most brilliant, breakthrough metaphor. I read that in your paper last night, I was up late reading it, and I got to whatever, page 30 and you got to some point where you said banks are in essence mining fiat and I thought, Oh my god, that is just the most \u2014 like, no one has ever said that before! But, once you get that idea you\u2019re like, Now I know why I wanna run a bank, and now I realize why the world is so screwed up because they\u2019re out of control. So keep going, but I just wanted to say, I think it\u2019s unique, seminal, brilliant, I\u2019ve never heard anybody ever express it that, but it explains so much once you have that metaphor in your head.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [47:59]: Yeah, it\u2019s why everybody is in debt, because every time you get into debt, you\u2019re allowing somebody else to mine fiat, effectively. So if you want to buy a house for $1 million with cash\u2014that\u2019s one thing, but then if you take the cash from a bank, well the bank gets to create $100,000 or $200,000 or $300,000 of new fiat out of this process. So, they\u2019re gonna give you a better deal on it than if you buy it with cash, and that\u2019s why you get into debt for your house and for your business, and for everything. You know, individuals and corporations and governments\u2014everybody is up to their eyeballs in debt because getting into debt is mining fiat. So I think this might be the most vivid way in which Bitcoin fixes the world, this might be the most powerful way, because this allows us to monetize something other than debt. We don\u2019t need to keep mining debt in order to have money, we can start mining a hard asset that has no counter-party liability, and that is much more solid, whereas, you can build a financial system on it because you know that the value of this Bitcoin is not dependent on counter-parties making this financial obligation. But currently, the choice that you would\u2019ve faced with your reserves before Bitcoin was, you had to put them either in cash and watch them get robbed of purchasing power every year, or you had to put them in debt and then take on the counter-party risk of the governments or the agencies or all the bonds that you\u2019re using, and primarily it\u2019s government treasuries that people use the most. The interesting thing to think about is that if Bitcoin leads to a reduction in the demand for debt, a reduction in the demand for treasuries\u2014because people like you are using Bitcoin as a reserve asset rather than holding bonds, then I think there\u2019s another factor that goes in, because Bitcoin is, (a) it\u2019s leading to a reduction in the demand for dollars, but (b) it\u2019s also leading to a reduction in the supply of newly mined fiat dollars because it\u2019s reducing the demand for debt. Or at least if it increases significantly, you know \u2014 we\u2019re gonna see a hundred Microstrategy(s), that means less demand for government bonds. So in a sense it kind of cancels each-other out: Bitcoin is not just taking the demand away from the dollar\u2014it\u2019s taking the demand away from the dollar and reducing the supply of the dollar, which I think is an optimistic way of saying we don\u2019t have to have hyperinflation. We can witness this thing continue, whereby, the supply of the dollar declines and the demand for the dollar declines while the value of Bitcoin rises and the demand for Bitcoin rises."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I think that this is one of the reasons why Bitcoin should be positioned as an asset \u2014 a crypto-asset \u2014 and not as a currency, because you have multiple monetary systems: you\u2019ve got the fiat monetary system\u2014and as we\u2019ve said, if you put $100 million into fiat, you\u2019re gonna lose 99% of your money over a hundred years. And then you\u2019ve got a gold monetary system: you put $100 million in gold, you\u2019re gonna lose 80% or 85% or 90% of your position over a hundred years, because it\u2019s inflating, and it\u2019s got counter-party risk. And then you\u2019ve got a stock monetary system: you\u2019ve got like an equity monetary system \u2014 that people are worshiping at the altar of NASDAQ right now. And they\u2019re basically floating into Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, because they think that these are indestructible utilities that\u2019ll go on forever. So you put it into those, and I think you\u2019re gonna lose value because at some point they\u2019re gonna get regulated and they\u2019re gonna actually get chopped into pieces by well-meaning politicians. One way or the other. But that system has captured all the value, right? All of the wealth on Wall Street has surged: first it moved into bonds and then it moved out of bonds into the equity markets over the past 3\u20134 months. The only way you stay in bonds \u2014 by the way, there\u2019s a bond monetary system. If the interest rates are gonna keep going down, the bonds will keep going up, so you put your store of value into bonds. And the only way that keeps working now is interest rates have to go negative. If interest rates don\u2019t go negative, the bond monetary system stops working for the wealth of the world, so they go to equity. And that\u2019s why the Big Tech is a crowded trade, and why the NASDAQ has gone to all-time highs\u2014and the S&P. Now, at some point that stops working, because the P/Es blow out and you\u2019re valuing Apple at 3x \u2014 you\u2019ve got companies that are a hundred times revenue that are trading on NASDAQ now. So at some point that de-laminates, and now, what you really wanna do is position Bitcoin as another digital asset, and then you have all the people with their money in Apple, in Amazon, in Facebook, in Google, surging into Bitcoin as the store of value, right? There\u2019s a good story\u2014this is why you don\u2019t want to curry the narrative of: well this is for privacy and fighting the government and escaping regulations and censorship and off-chain and \u201cWe hate Wall Street, We hate institutions, We hate institutional custodians\u201d \u2014 if you\u2019re basically going down that narrative, you\u2019re inviting every government to outlaw you. And the number one issue, Saifedean, of\u2014can we have a peaceful transition from a debt economy to a Bitcoin economy \u2014 is: are they gonna outlaw Bitcoin? Okay? If they think that Bitcoin is Apple stock, the answer is no. If Bitcoin is Apple or Bitcoin is Google or Bitcoin is Amazon, they\u2019ll bounce it around a bit but no one is walking around saying We need to pass a law to stop you from owning Apple stock. On the other hand, when you start talking about, I wanna do things to evade regulators and the like, it\u2019s like in Russia they said you can\u2019t use it as a currency, you can use it as an asset, that was the law. What you wanna do is you wanna position Bitcoin as an asset, and then people will just sit around and say, Am I gonna put my money in real estate or gold or silver or Bitcoin or Apple stock? And then it\u2019s kind of an easy decision, isn\u2019t it? I mean, as soon as you know it\u2019s not gonna blow up and fail\u2014if Bitcoin was a company, or whatever, I think you\u2019d see a surge. And for us to see a peaceful transition, we need to not have a situation like in Venezuela or a Zimbabwe where they pass a law and they say, You can\u2019t have it. You don\u2019t wanna go back to\u2014you saw with the 1934 Gold Act, right? You don\u2019t want the government to seize your gold, and you don\u2019t want them to seize your Bitcoin. [54:54] And so, to the extent that they just view it as another asset that people choose to hold and is non-threatening, I think that you\u2019ll see a migration to it. To the extent that they see it as trying to replace the US Dollar, then it becomes a different thing. So, that\u2019s what I think on that.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous [55:17]: Yeah. What do you think of the idea that Bitcoin can potentially be the final \u2014 be the way that we get rid of QE? Right now all Wall Street companies, they constantly face liquidity problems whenever there\u2019s any kind of problem in the market and then that requires an endless amount of liquidity intervention. But if they had a proper cash reserve on their balance sheet, they wouldn\u2019t care about these liquidity problems, you know? Bitcoin would hold its value and it would appreciate now and then."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor: I agree with your idea that Bitcoin is the fiat vigilante, or the currency. I agree with that. I think that, as it gets stronger, the number one benefit of it is it keeps everybody else honest. Right? It spreads, it keeps people honest. If the government \u2014 let\u2019s take Argentina \u2014 if the government of Argentina knew that every wealthy Argentinian, everybody in Argentina had their treasury in Bitcoin, they would think twice before they print kazillion amounts of additional currency, right? It will create a discipline, because the citizenry has some power, the citizenry can choose not to participate. So as it spreads I think it will create rationale. I think, if you have no alternative\u2014in the absence of an alternative \u2014 I think the politicians start to overreach.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: Absolutely. Yeah, I used to live in Lebanon up until very recently, and if you\u2019ve heard the news, Lebanon\u2019s banking system is in tatters now and the currency\u2019s been destroyed, and after I left, I realized that banks were giving insanely high interest rates to people on their savings accounts, and for me the amazing thing about Bitcoin is that all of those years I\u2019d lived in Lebanon and I never borrowed a cent or lent a cent to my bank, basically. My paycheck comes into my bank, and I use it just for day to day transactions and then never had to worry about what\u2019s going to happen with the Lebanese government and their solvency and all of the bonds and all of that stuff. And it\u2019s amazing to think that if in 20 years time, everybody else in countries like Lebanon and Argentina had that option, then there\u2019s very very little scope or room for the government to rob people. The peace of mind that comes to me from the fact that, no matter what happens in all of the world\u2019s banks, and all of the world\u2019s central banks, and all of the world\u2019s governments, they\u2019ll never be able to destroy more than a small part of my wealth which I happen to keep in any particular bank at any particularly point in time. And this is just amazing, you know? It\u2019s a one-time solution to make sure that you will never be Lebanon\u2019ed, you will never get the Argentina Special, you will never get that inflation. It\u2019s amazing. And I think it\u2019s only a matter of time before more and more people figure out this solution."}
{"prompt": "Michael Saylor [58:23]: So, Saifedean, I gotta go in a moment because I\u2019m being called away to my next meeting, but I just wanted to leave you with a couple thoughts. While I\u2019m sitting, for days at a time, and I\u2019m trading and I\u2019m buying this Bitcoin, and I watch \u201cmoney\u201d\u2014$500,000 of cash \u2014 become, whatever, 50 Bitcoin, and I\u2019m watching these kind of things happen, I had this epiphany that the destiny of money is to be encrypted. Every time I did the trade I thought, I just took $500,000 of cash \u2014 that someone can burn and steal \u2014 and I put it into a vault of encrypted energy, and now they can\u2019t get at it, and I just had this massive dopamine hit, that this felt so good to encrypt my money. The destiny of money is to be encrypted \u2014 in Bitcoin\u2014not any encryption. The second observation is, I just think your book is brilliant, and your work is brilliant, and you should publish again. I\u2019m in favor of it, let me know if I can help. And that my third observation is, if you do call it The Fiat Standard, I\u2019m not converting all of my money to fiat.\n\n###\n\n", "completion": " Saifedean Ammous: The plan is the opposite!"}
