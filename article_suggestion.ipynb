It is not enough for an organization to distribute keys between its own people, although that will help. However, it is much easier for people within an organization to collude than without, and furthermore within an organization people will tend to have similar characters so the probabilities that each is a bad actor are not independent of one another. Votes must come from different organizations on order to maximize the security of the wallet.   \n",

As long as they reach many nodes, they will get into a block before long. Block broadcasts are also tolerant of dropped messages. If a node does not receive a block, it will request it when it receives the next block and realizes it missed one.   \n",

Bitcoins total market value has at times exceeded $1 trillion US dollars, depending on the bitcoin-to-dollar exchange rate.

This makes the preferred even more preferable than before. Any two moneys will interact in this way, thus leaving one to dominate the rest.   \n",
       "1610  On a larger scale, the Laffer curve may be the most important economic law of political history. Adams[1] uses it to explain the rise and fall of empires. The most successful governments have been implicitly guided by their own incentives  both their short-term desire for revenue and their long-term success against other governments  to optimize their revenues according to the Laffer Curve. Governments that overburdened their taxpayers, such as the Soviet Union and later Roman Empire, ended up on the dust-heap of history, while governments that collected below the optimum were often conquered by their better-funded neighbors.

Per Wikipedia: \"Next to humans, leafcutter ants form the largest and most complex animal societies on Earth.\" Leafcutter ants dont actually eat leaves, but rather use them to farm a fungus, which is the central food source for the colony. Get that? These ants are farming!   \n",
